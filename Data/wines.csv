France,93,49,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Joseph Mellot 2012 La Grande Cuvée des Edvins  (Pouilly-Fumé),"The top Pouilly Fumé from Joseph Mellot is a complex wine with rich, rounded fruits touched by wood aging. Yellow fruits dominate, given a further lift by apple acidity and a smoky flavor. Delicious now, it's a powerful wine that could age further, so keep until 2015."
France,88,14,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château de Fontenille 2015  Bordeaux,Stéphane Defraine's wine is rich with dark black fruits. The tannins with spice and a firm core give this wine density. It is already powerful and concentrated. It will be ready from 2018.
France,90,38,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Château de Tracy 2010  Pouilly-Fumé,"An intensely herbal and ageworthy wine, this has tight acidity and a very fresh gooseberry character. With its intensity of flavor, it has something in common with New World Sauvignon Blanc—except this has terroir-driven minerality on the finish."
US,83,20,Pinot Noir,red,Robert Goyette 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Funky earth and a diluted body make for a generic experience with this wine, which simultaneously offers a large tannin profile plus a weedy, dried herb component."
US,94,58,Pinot Noir,red,Dutton-Goldfield 2009 McDougall Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Somewhere between the acidity and dryness, this Pinot has a terrifically interesting core. It's a subtle wine, now suggesting cherry fruit, now retreating in favor of earthier mushrooms, minerals and pine needles, framed in firm tannins. Strikes out new territory for cool-climate Pinot Noir, less ripe, lower in alcohol and more exciting."
US,91,54,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Greyscale 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Kian Tavakoli is the winemaker for this small-production Cabernet Sauvignon with some Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. A brambly, full-bodied wine, it's concentrated in black fruit with a spicy streak of clove."
France,86,12,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,André Brunel 2009 Red (Côtes du Rhône),"A slightly chunky and inelegant Côtes du Rhône, this wine nevertheless delivers satisfying and assertive notes of black olive, espresso and dark chocolate. Drink it over the next few years."
France,83,12,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château d'Haurets 2009  Bordeaux Blanc,"Light and dilute, this is a pleasant wine, soft with hints of pineapple and a fresh aftertaste. Screw cap."
US,86,35,Pinot Noir,red,Raptor Ridge 2000 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A deep sniff delivers leather, ripe black cherry, marzipan and some smokiness, but the palate isn't congruent. It's candied, a bit burnt, and it tastes just a tad too much like cherry cough syrup. The texture is fine and the flavors solid, but it falls short in the areas of layering and elegance. It's too one-dimensional and not multifaceted. –M.S."
France,95,116,Chardonnay,white,Joseph Drouhin 2013 Clos de la Garenne Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),"This offers toast and spice aromas, with opulent apricots and white peaches along with intense freshness from the acidity and linear structure. The wood aging just shows through in the roundness of the wine, while leaving room for a fresh, crisp, mineral aftertaste. Drink from 2018."
US,84,26,Red Blend,red,Sanglier Cellars 2011 Rouge du Tusque Red (Sonoma County),"It's explosive in jammy, pie-filling raspberries and cherries, with a hit of caramelized oak. Drink it now with simple fare."
US,88,30,Merlot,red,Gordon Estate 2012 Block 3 Reserve Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The oak (21 months spent in French and American) takes the lead, with aromas of baking spices, green wood and vanilla out in front of cherry. The flavors are sweet, supported by grainy tannins that show some dryness."
Italy,91,30,Sangiovese,red,Fontodi 2010  Chianti Classico,"Made from organic grapes, this succulent wine delivers balsamic aromas and juicy black cherry flavors layered with cinnamon and white pepper. It's radiant and structured, with big round tannins and edgy acidity. Drink 2015–2025."
Italy,87,24,Pinot Grigio,white,Conte d'Attimis-Maniago 2011 Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"This pretty Pinot Grigio opens with creamy aromas of melon, stone fruit and pear. It has a full, generous and persistent personality."
US,85,15,Chardonnay,white,Bowers Harbor 2013 Unwooded Chardonnay (Old Mission Peninsula),"Green apple with a squeeze of fresh lemon makes for a basic and easy unoaked Chardonnay. While standard and simple, this is a perfectly enjoyable wine to pair with lighter fare."
US,93,50,Syrah,red,Melville 2014 Donna's Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),"Superfresh and fennel-laced on the nose, this cool-climate Syrah shows underripe plums, raspberry, charcoal, lavender, pepper sauce, thyme and forest underbrush on the nose. It's impressively floral on the energetic, not overly dense sip, with lavender, rosehip and white sage touches enlivening the dark red fruit."
Italy,88,120,Merlot,red,Tenuta Villa Trasqua 2008 Trasolo Merlot (Toscana),"Aromas of vanilla, prune and nutmeg lead the nose on this robust Merlot. The dense, monolithic palate offers raisin, leather and licorice alongside the heat of evident alcohol and drying tannins. It's shy on freshness and fruit richness so drink sooner rather than later."
US,89,12,Chardonnay,white,Pedroncelli 2009 Vintage Selection Chardonnay (Dry Creek Valley),"One of the best Chardonnays available at this price. Shows welcome restraint in the crisp, clean flavors of pineapples, Meyer lemons, pears and green apples, with just a touch of oak. If you just judge by price, you'll be amazed how complex and layered it is."
US,89,15,Pinot Noir,red,O'Reilly's 2006 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This is hands-down the best value Pinot Noir made in Oregon, year in and year out. It's firm and full-bodied, perfectly ripe, with lovely spices that range from pepper to cinnamon and allspice. The fruit lingers in the midpalate, round and tangy, with flavors of cherry and plum. It's a thoroughly rich and satisfying wine that is big enough to work with dark poultry, salmon and even veal."
US,94,145,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Merus 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is marked by hard tannins and acidity, bearing blackberry, dark chocolate and mineral flavors, with a smoky oak note that is unintegrated with the other components. Will it age? There's a purity to the core that strongly suggests it will. Hold it until 2017, and it could develop bottle nuance well beyond that."
US,92,42,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Stevens 2004 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),"Dark and dense, yet somehow soft and approachable, this 100% is once again loaded with rich black fruits. Everything is in balance, with a captivating tension strung between the fruit, acid and tannins. This is a wine you can't keep your lips off."
US,89,33,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Gård 2011 Lawrence Vineyards Vaucluse Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"In this pungent wine, Syrah is co-fermented with a touch of Viognier, then blended with 33% Grenache. Interesting scents of diesel, soil and stem wrap into the tight red berry fruit. It rounds into a rather soft, easy-drinking red that should be consumed through 2017."
US,88,22,Pinot Noir,red,Silvan Ridge 2005 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Forward and fruity, this has California-style fruit and sweet, strawberry candy. The difference is that it fills out the middle with some leafy, herbal flavors, nothing too rough, but enough to add some flavor interest. The finish is fat and buttery, showing the influence of oak aging."
France,86,11,White Blend,white,Domaine du Tariquet 2014 Classic White (Côtes de Gascogne),"From one of the largest private vineyards in France (2,300 acres), this wine epitomizes the light and fresh style that comes from Gascony in the hidden southwest of France. It is fruity, citrus-crisp with a touch of honey from the Gros Manseng in the blend. Drink now."
US,90,36,Red Blend,red,Doyenne 2006 Métier Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Fruit compote—plum and strawberry—is melded to light toast and coffee. The wine has juicy acids and a thickly satisfying midpalate whose fruit flavors linger on, adding a little peppery spice as the wine evolves in the mouth. Just a whisp of chocolate leaves you ready for the next sip."
US,93,64,Pinot Noir,red,Arista 2013 Mononi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"From a tiny, three-acre vineyard, this wine is soft, seamless and delightfully floral, offering lithe layers of red cherry, tea and oak, barely able to rein in its savory underbrush of black earth. Crisp, the acidity is pronounced and lengthy and the rose aromatics irresistibly persistent."
US,88,15,Riesling,white,Red Newt Cellars 2013 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Fresh green sage and tarragon notes lend an herbaceous freshness to this elegant off-dry Riesling. It's dancingly delicate on the palate, but sunny yellow cherry and tangerine flavors are bright and concentrated."
US,94,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Terra Valentine 2010 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"Exceptionally ripe, concentrated mountain fruit as well as hard tannins characterize this fresh, young Cabernet. Through the tannic astringency, intense flavors of black currants, dark chocolate and the sweet sap of oak shine through. Needs time. Hold until 2016 and see how it's doing."
Italy,87,35,Chardonnay,white,Spadafora 2011 Schietto Chardonnay (Sicilia),"Aged partly in barriques, it offers aromas of yellow apples, toast and butterscotch that carry over to the palate along with lemon drop, oak, toast and coffee bean. You'll also notice the alcohol."
US,84,12,Zinfandel,red,Rancho Zabaco 2000 Dancing Bull Zinfandel (California),"A simple, fruity Zin that blends damp soil and stewed berries with chocolate and toast. Mostly Lodi fruit, with bits and pieces of the blend coming from Mendocino, Sonoma and Paso Robles; also contains traces of Petite Sirah and Syrah."
US,90,50,Red Blend,red,Château Élan 2013 Les Petits Red (America),"This dark, potent, full-bodied wine is made from two of the darkest, most tannic grape varieties—Petit Verdot and Petite Syrah—and there is nothing petite about this blend. Its color is almost black and opaque, while aromas and flavors suggest smoke, blueberry and espresso. The texture is tannic but not overbearing."
Italy,88,30,Red Blend,red,Tenuta di Castellaro 2011 Nero Ossidiana Red (Sicilia),"Made by blending 60% Corinto, 20% Nero d'Avola and 20% other varieties, this opens with aromas of underbrush, game, leather, spice and mature black fruit. The warm palate delivers smooth tannins and flavors of blackberry, prune and black pepper. This isn't an ager, so drink soon."
Italy,90,40,Red Blend,red,Guicciardini Strozzi 2005 Ocra  (Bolgheri),"It's amazing how much this wine smells like peppermint. A blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah, this is a distinctive wine that offers playful aromas of clove, cardamom, chocolate and rhubarb behind a solid wall of spearmint. It has tight tannins, a solid structure and fresh acidity."
France,90,37,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine Roblin 2010 Ammonites  (Sancerre),"With three years' aging, this has developed into an almond- and toast-flavored wine that has softened and rounded the fruit. It has turned into a serious wine, its rich structure allied to the acidity. Ready to drink."
US,90,38,Syrah,red,Belharra 2015 Las Madres Vineyards Syrah (Carneros),"This is from a cool-climate 9-acre site divided into two blocks, cooled by afternoon breezes off San Pablo Bay. It shows off the site in its embrace of high-toned fruit flavors of plum, blueberry, cranberry and dried cherry, the background meaty in chewy tannin and concentrated oak."
France,90,34,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château le Grand Moulin 2015 Prélude No. 15  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"Mint aromas from new oak aging and spice and toast notes on the palate are part of this young, firm-structured wine. It 's powerful and dense, with great black fruit and acidity. A dry core of tannins indicates it will age. Drink from 2020."
France,84,22,Pinot Noir,red,Domaines Devillard 2009 Le Renard  (Bourgogne),"Structure goes with red berry fruits in this light, crisp wine. It has a tendency to a tight texture and lean tannins. Ready to drink."
France,94,40,Riesling,white,Domaine Fernand Engel 2014 Mandelberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Earth and apple, citrus and herb all mingle on nose and palate. It is the green apple with its chamomile edge and above all the bright ripe lemon freshness which expands across the dry palate. This is full of bright refreshing citrus and a beautifully understated vigor which will live in this wine for years to come. The finish culminates in a gorgeously tart but ripe apple notion. Very moreish now and approachable but with lots of future promise. Drink 2017–2030."
US,88,22,Merlot,red,L'Ecole No. 41 2014 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas are barrel-forward at present, with notes of baking spice and vanilla in front of red fruit. The flavors are plump in feel but also come off as quite woody. There are lots of good things going on. Perhaps some additional time in the bottle will pull them all together."
France,91,36,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Beauséjour 2014 Cuvée Spéciale  (Puisseguin Saint-Émilion),"This is a delicious ripe wine, full of black fruits and with generous tannins. Mint flavors come from the new wood aging and enhance the ripe berry flavors and acidity. Drink this structured wine from 2018."
US,84,25,Riesling,white,Black Box 2013 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Moderately aromatic, this offers notes of red apple, jasmine, and peach. It drinks off dry leaning toward medium sweet, with abundant peach flavors with a creamy feel. It needs a bit more acidity to hold it all together."
France,88,21,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Maison Givas 2014 Vin No. 09  (Lalande de Pomerol),"Full of jammy Merlot fruits, this is a smooth ripe wine. Dried fruits and tannins give the wine its varietal character. They are freshened by the acidity and black-currant fruitiness. The aftertaste allows the firm tannins to shine. Drink from 2017."
US,93,48,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Volker Eisele Family Estate 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A distinguished, impressive Cabernet, obviously the result of fine grapegrowing and meticulous berry selection. It's bone dry, rich in tannins and firm, with mineral-infused blackberry and black currant flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Will develop bottle complexity for a good eight years."
US,90,26,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Steele 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County),"Full-bodied but easy to drink, this well-modulated wine from a section of Lake County known for excellent reds combines nicely ripe flavors with a smoothly tannic texture. It has ripe plum and raisin notes, a lightly spicy, smoky oak accent and a lingering finish."
US,88,42,Chardonnay,white,Buty 2015 Conner Lee Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is a bit reductive out of the gate, opening to reveal aromas of pear, peach, melon, lees and spice. The palate is creamy and textured in feel. If the aromas come together, it could move up a notch."
US,93,68,Pinot Noir,red,Red Car 2012 Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Heftier than the producer's Platt Vineyard Pinot, this estate-grown wine features astoundingly bright acidity around dense black cherry fruit. It saw 10% stem inclusion during fermentation and was aged in 20% new oak for just over a year, a recipe that works to buoy the wine and give it plenty of complexity."
US,85,14,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Fulkerson 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),"Herbaceous and brisk, this elegant, medium-bodied Cabernet perks up on the palate with its crisp red-fruit and acidity. Straightforward yet pleasantly accented with hints of violet and black coffee, it would pair well with a variety of earthy, fall braises."
US,92,45,Syrah,red,JM Cellars 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is Syrah co-fermented with Viognier coming from Boushey and Stillwater Creek vineyards. The aromas pop with notes of boysenberry cobbler, orange peel and whiffs of smoked meat, while the palate delivers intensity, flavor and richness."
US,90,55,Red Blend,red,Nicholas Cole Cellars 2005 Michele Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Very ripe flavors of berries and figs dominate this Cab-centric Bordeaux blend, along with intriguing side notes suggesting melon and cassis, smoke and mocha. It's a big, sexy wine, its fruit flavors backed with thick, ripe, but chalky tannins. If there is a downside, it is that it comes off as a bit monolithic."
US,89,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Concrete 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"This big bold wine takes flavor to the limits. Spicy, peppery, beefy aromas and bold smoke, blueberry and clove flavors rely a lot on oak, but have a good concentrated fruit foundation underneath. It is full bodied, mouth-filling and nicely tannic."
US,87,25,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Star Angel by Montes 2008 Red Wine Red (Paso Robles),"Soft, velvety and fruity, with chocolate, black raspberry, currant and oak flavors this blend is spiced up with white pepper and cinnamon notes. Drink this hearty wine with stews, barbecue or pasta."
France,82,13,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Trocard 2009  Bordeaux Supérieur,"There is an awkwardness to this wine, coming from the overripe fruit and juicy character. It lacks structure and will likely age quickly."
US,84,42,Merlot,red,Sunstone 2005 Estate Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),"Tastes like a dessert pastry, with baked cherry, cassis, peppermint, milk chocolate and anise flavors that are a little sweet and honeyed. Pleasant, but not impactful. Drink now."
France,90,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château La Garricq 2011  Moulis-en-Médoc,"From an eight-acre vineyard, this is produced by the same team as Château Paloumey. Powerful and concentrated, it is also elegant, balancing its structure with good berry fruits and acidity. The tannins are still considerable, so drink from 2017."
Italy,91,29,Red Blend,red,Canneto 2009  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,"Here's a savory selection, offering earthy and balsamic aromas of underbrush, tobacco and Mediterranean herbs. The restrained palate reveals ripe plum, cassis and licorice notes layered with chewy tannins and a warm midpalate."
France,92,68,Chardonnay,white,Bruno Paillard NV Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Extra Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"From Grand Cru vineyards in the Côte des Blancs, this fresh and fruity wine is now at its peak of crispness and minerality. It has concentration and a lively texture with white fruits, citrus and a bright, tight aftertaste. It could age after purchase, although there is no need."
Italy,93,70,Sangiovese,red,Fattoria di Corsignano 2012 L'Imperatrice Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),"Aromas of dark plum, sun-baked soil, cooking spice and grilled herb flow together in the glass. Made entirely with Sangiovese, the palate shows breeding and class, offering ripe black cherry, ground pepper, tobacco and aniseed alongside youthfully austere tannins. Give this time to fully develop. Drink 2017–2027."
US,86,38,Syrah,red,Bella 2005 Lily Hill Estate Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"Bella has a spotty record with this wine. The '05, from a cooler vintage, shows a Northern Rhône dryness and peppery taste, with good blackberry and currant flavors. But the tannins are very hard, almost old-fashioned in the way they shut the palate down."
US,87,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Vellum 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Impressive from the start for its rich blackberry and dark chocolate flavors, thick tannins and sweet overlay of smoky oak. Could be an ager, but some bitterness in the middle suggests the fruit will fall out before the tannins resolve."
US,87,22,Riesling,white,Anam Cara 2011 Nicholas Estate Dry Riesling (Chehalem Mountains),"Seemingly as tart as a Riesling can get despite having residual sugar of 1.2%, this lemony lip-smacker shows good concentration. It would be a gem with the right foods, but on its own, the searingly tart acids may be too much for most tasters."
US,87,13,Chardonnay,white,Layer Cake 2012 Chardonnay (Central Coast),"With a motto of “affordable luxury,” Layer Cake sources Chardonnay fruit from the fringes of pricey appellations. In this case it draws from Monterey County vineyards near the Santa Lucia Highlands and Santa Barbara County vineyard between the Santa Maria Valley and the Sta. Rita Hills. The results are solid for the price, with expressive aromas of honeydew and vanilla soda, and a palate of juicy melon and toasted oak. It is slightly boozy, so very much in the cocktail style, and is not for those afraid of oak."
US,84,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Brander 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"Dry and rich in tannins, but not quite ripe, with a vegetal note to the blackberries and cherries. Drink now."
US,90,36,Red Blend,red,Lowden Hills 2008 Twelve Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A super Tuscan blend, half Sangiovese, the other half split between Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. It's quite a success; bright and spicy, the fruit flavors crisply defined, mixing raspberry, blackberry and cherry. Clean and deep, with polished tannins, and just a hint of heat in the finish."
US,86,85,Syrah,red,Sanguis 2010 1/1 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"An eccentric wine, very high in alcohol, yet there's a strange vegetal element. Otherwise, it's all about sweet blackberry jam, mushu plum sauce, white pepper and charred bacon. The green veggie note, which winemaker Matthias Pippig describes as “savage”, persists into the finish."
France,85,21,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine Patrice Moreux 2012  Pouilly-Fumé,"Light and textured, it's packed with lime and lemon flavors with a hint of sage. As dry as a bone, it's very much for food and is ready to drink."
US,88,50,Red Blend,red,Alexander the Grape 2011 The Conqueror Klipsun Vineyards Red (Red Mountain),"This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah brings aromas of Mounds Bar, spice and cherry. The flavors are tightly wound, showing a mixture of fruit and barrel with a persistent finish. The oak rides heavy but there are good things going on."
France,92,46,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Gérard Duplessis 2013 Fourchaume Premier Cru  (Chablis),"Close to the slope of Grand Crus, Fourchaume is one of the best known of the premiers in Chablis. This ripe wine with its touches of vanilla as well as yellow fruits and acidity has a lightly honeyed character typical of the vintage. It is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017."
France,92,65,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine Vacheron 2014 Guigne-Chèvres  (Sancerre),"From a biodynamic vineyard in the heart of Sancerre, this wine is tight, mineral-driven and very young, well balanced between herbal and citrus flavors. These are lifted and filled out with the ripe Rocha pear flavors that give an extra juicy element. The wine will age well and will be better after 2018."
US,86,59,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Prime Solum 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This syrupy, dense red exhibits tobacco and root beer flavors, framed with chunky tannins. Blackberry and black current fruit barely show through its leathery texture and profound weight."
US,92,35,Merlot,red,Ballentine 2014 Estate Grown Merlot (Napa Valley),"Handfuls of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot figure into this wine, a lovely, medium-bodied beauty that finds balance in its measured use of oak. Vanilla, plum and bold jolts of pepper and cinnamon combine well on the lengthy palate."
US,90,36,Syrah,red,Margerum 2007 Colson Canyon Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"If more Syrah tasted like this, more people would drink it. Beautifully ripe and soft, pure and rich in cherry and raspberry liqueur, smoke and pepper flavors. Ready now."
US,90,70,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Freemark Abbey 2006 Sycamore Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"This is a powerful, gutsy Cabernet, currently lacking finesse. It's young, dry and brash, with sticky tannins and unmelded flavors and textures. The blackberry, cherry and oak flavors are sweet and delicious. Seems best now and soon, although it could be a sleeper."
France,88,25,Riesling,white,Cave de Kientzheim-Kaysersberg 2010 Exception Riesling (Alsace),"This is a ripe, delicately tropical and fruity wine with rich texture. It is smooth, rounded on the palate, but accompanied by a shot of acidity. The lemon aftertaste hints at a more steely character."
US,84,9,Pinot Noir,red,Smoking Loon 2001 Pinot Noir (California),"From Sebastiani, proof that Pinot Noir has been overplanted in California. This has some pleasant Pinot character in the cherry, spice and earth flavors and light, silky tannins, but it's a simple, one-dimensional wine."
US,87,60,Pinot Noir,red,Tudor Wines 2007 Balo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"A good, dry Pinot Noir, tart in acidity, and showing flavors of sour cherries, currants and beef jerky, sweetened with caramelized oak. It's a little rustic, but elegant. Drink now."
Italy,87,15,Sangiovese,red,Bonacchi 2013 Casalino Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Blue flower, iris, used leather and woodland berry aromas float out of the glass. The easygoing palate offers red cherry, white pepper and a hint of anise accompanied by soft relaxed tannins. Drink through 2017."
US,91,55,Pinot Noir,red,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2013 Bernau Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Planted in 1983, this is the original Willamette Valley Vineyards estate vineyard. These old vines give an extra dollop of herb and stem, well integrated into concentrated raspberry and cherry fruit. This has the tannic muscle and acid underpinning to age well. Drink now–2025."
US,87,15,Riesling,white,Heron Hill 2008 Ingle Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Zippy and fresh with a gentle prickle on the tongue, this dry Riesling smells of sweet, fresh apples laced with just a hint of petrol. On the palate, soft apple and pear flavors are edged with slate and stones, and a shower of fresh lime on the finish."
US,84,18,Chardonnay,white,Laurier 2009 Chardonnay (Los Carneros),"Like a fruit juice drink, with sugary pineapple, mango and orange flavors. The acidity is bright, but this Chardonnay is more like a dessert wine than a dry table wine."
US,84,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Weinstock Cellars 2009 Cellar Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa County),"This is nicely dry and rich in fine tannins, with classic Cabernet blackberry, black currant, cola and cedar flavors. But the wine is so soft, it lacks structural integrity."
US,88,16,White Blend,white,Heron Hill 2015 Eclipse White (New York),"This dry light-footed blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Blanc and Pinot Gris offers zesty grapefruit and lemon flavors edged with white tea leaves. Balanced in alcohol, subtle and refreshing, it finishes on a clean, slightly mineral tone."
US,87,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Barra of Mendocino 2014 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino),"Drenched with luscious grapey flavors, this medium-bodied wine soothes the palate. Its texture is smooth and carries the fruitiness through the aftertaste."
US,87,100,Zinfandel,red,Renwood 2010 Grand Wren Zinfandel (Amador County),"Encapsulated in a big, beautifully etched bottle with black wax closure, Grand Wren is a grand statement—an explosion of smoke, leather and ripe fruit. It's smooth in texture, but with streaks of bright acidity throughout. The finish is big and bold with a Port-like intensity."
US,87,17,Red Blend,red,Pendulum 2015 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This blend of Petit Verdot (28%), Malbec (27%), Syrah (20%), Cabernet Sauvignon (16%) and Merlot (9%) leads with wild blueberry, crushed flower, herb, vanilla and spice aromas. Soft, elegant blueberry flavors follow, persisting on the finish. Light on the midpalate, it still brings appeal."
US,88,14,Riesling,white,Heron Hill 2014 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"The nose on this semi-dry Riesling is a touch savory, brimming with green herb, pressed apple and pear aromas. The palate, however, turns fresher, floral and fruity, filling the mouth with sweet-tart grapefruit and peach flavors. Nervy acidity extends a moderately long finish."
US,92,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Efeste 2013 Big Papa Old Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is the first vintage of this wine to include estate fruit, along with fruit from Klipsun, Bacchus and Red Willow. A complex medley of herb and spice aromas accented by purple flowers is followed by bold yet still refined dark-fruit flavors that linger on the finish. It has the tannin to go the distance. Best after 2020."
US,84,29,Chardonnay,white,Paradise Springs 2013 Chardonnay (Virginia),"A faint nose of lemon starts things off. Simple and clean on the palate, that same citrus character pervades, keeping things short and snappy."
US,92,50,Chardonnay,white,Amalie Robert 2013 Pabuk's Gift Late Harvest Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Typhoon Pabuk drenched the valley during harvest and botrytised these grapes. Making lemonade out of that lemon, the winery hand-sorted the grapes and crafted this ultrarich dessert wine. Dense flavors of butterscotch and sweet lemon candy make a potent combo. One half-size bottle will easily satisfy four sweet tooths."
US,86,14,Riesling,white,Lucas Vineyards 2010 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"While initially a bit musky and waxy on the nose, this Riesling gains strength on the palate as it offers rich honey and red apple flavors. The lemon-lime-like acidity lingers on the finish."
US,92,99,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Tobacco Road 2008 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This private reserve is 93% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot, aged considerably in bottle. Rich and full-bodied, it has a vanilla-kissed nose and earthy leather pedigree, the black cherry flavor concentrated and thick."
US,90,40,Pinot Noir,red,Drew 2009 Valenti Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge),"The Mendocino Ridge appellation, which is defined by elevation boundaries, borders Anderson Valley. This Pinot shows cool-climate crispness but also fog-free, ripe flavors of raspberries and cherries that are deep and impressive. With a thick, juvenile mouthfeel, the wine should develop interesting bottle complexities over the next five years."
US,83,11,Red Blend,red,Bogle 2011 Essential Red (California),"The blend is Zinfandel, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah. The wine is soft and luscious, with cherry candy and vanilla flavors."
US,91,16,Zinfandel,red,Villa Mt. Eden 2004 Grand Reserve Antique Vines Zinfandel (Napa-Amador),"This two-region Zin is from Atlas Peak and Amador County. It shows a really great Zin quality in the leathery spiciness that accompanies the berry flavors, and in the smooth, polished tannins. Amador seems to bring wildness, while Napa brings elegance. The result is a great Zinfandel at a great price."
US,84,15,Pinot Noir,red,Barefoot Cellars 1999 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"Light and delicate, it attracts more for its stylish finesse than for any power or ageability. Berry and earth flavors are framed in modest tannins and soft acids, and there's some bitterness from the middle palate through the finish."
France,93,35,Pinot Gris,white,Domaine Charles Frey 2015 Frankstein Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives Pinot Gris (Alsace),"A mellow touch of ripe Red Delicious apple hovers on the nose. The palate brims with rich fruit, showing candied pear and dried apple. This richness is countered by a pleasantly bitter phenolic edge and a pure streak of fresh zestiness. A touch of sandalwood and cinnamon adds spice around the edges. While this is attractive now, it will reward cellaring as far more interesting notes of spice and fruit are sure to develop. Drink 2020–2030."
US,88,23,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Robert Mondavi 2000 SLD Sauvignon Blanc (Stags Leap District),"Very grassy and citrusy, with hints of garden-fresh vegetables and a slight floral note. It's light and almost airy on the tongue, finishing crisp and clean. A refreshing burst of anise caps things off."
France,85,28,Chardonnay,white,Domaine des Valanges 2014  Pouilly-Fuissé,"This wine is tight with the lightest hints of riper fruit in the future. It has spice, toast flavors and suggestions of yellow fruit. Wait to drink this wine until 2017."
US,92,36,Merlot,red,Keenan 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A delicious Merlot, drily tannic and rich in blackberries, cherries and chocolate. Nearly as good as the winery's much more expensive Reserve. Great with grilled steak with sautéed mushrooms."
US,93,55,Chardonnay,white,Sixto 2012 Moxee Chardonnay (Washington),"This directly appealing wine brings notes of the underside of a pineapple, chamomile, talc, wet stone and apricot, mixing delicacy and nuance. It's creamy in feel with rich, concentrated fruit flavors and a long, detailed finish."
Italy,89,60,Red Blend,red,Tedeschi 2009  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"This has fragrances of ripe black cherry, raisin and a touch of leather. The palate delivers raisin and raspberry flavors, along with spicy black pepper notes. The palate is a bit evolved, showing tertiary notes."
US,84,55,Pinot Noir,red,Rocking K 2010 Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Thin and dry, this wine has Pinot's silky mouthfeel, but little else. The mushroom, cola and spearmint flavors are relieved by some cherry fruit. Not going anywhere, so drink up."
US,91,40,Syrah,red,Kobler 2012 Kobler Family Vineyards Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Floral and in balance, this estate-grown wine is bright and light in cherry and raspberry, layered and velvety on the palate. It finishes in a fist of leather and black pepper."
US,85,32,Merlot,red,Keira 2014 Merlot (Yakima Valley),"This wine all comes Chandler Reach Vineyards. The aromas seem to lack clarity while the cranberry, prune and cherry flavors want for midpalate concentration."
US,85,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Maryhill 2010 Proprietor's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This simple Cabernet Sauvignon is lightly fruity and forward, with berry flavors that seem to fade on the midpalate. It resolves in a wash of drying, herbal tannins."
US,86,22,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Kokomo 2015 Timber Crest Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),"The producer ferments partially in new Acacia barrels, as well as in tank, with the result a mix of floral and fruity melon with firm acidity and a medium build. It's still very much in the throes of that oak."
US,85,10,White Blend,white,14 Hands 2015 Hot to Trot White (Columbia Valley (WA)),Aromas of Bosc pear and candle wax lead to off-dry fruit flavors. It brings some easy-drinking appeal but lacks a sense of clarity.
US,93,34,Zinfandel,red,Hartford 1999 Hartford Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"From the old vineyard in back of Don Hartford's house, this 15.7% alcohol Zin is big—but it's no brute. It's full of dark, rich blackberries, layered with chocolate and black pepper. The velvety texture carries through the long finish, picking up hints of black licorice. Editors' Choice."
France,88,24,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Haut Peyrefaure 2016  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"Ripe berry aromas set the scene for this balanced, juicy wine. Full of black currant and berry flavors, it's already delicious with its fruitiness. The tannins, though, need to calm down somewhat, and the wine will be better from 2019."
US,91,45,Pinot Noir,red,BlackCap 2010 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Beginning to round out its youthful edges, the BlackCap (so named for the native Oregon mushroom, berry and bird) offers pretty pie-cherry fruit, savory herbs and silky tannins. There's still some phenolic bite to the finish, suggesting that it can continue to smooth out over the next few years."
France,92,53,Pinot Gris,white,Domaine Gresser 2013 Wiebelsberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"The nose gives little away and is very shy. The palate, however, is a paradigm on lemony freshness—of textured candied lemon and pear richness and great concentration. All of the richness of Pinto Gris is present, but it is carried aloft by zesty citrus freshness to strike a note of harmonious tangy balance. The finish shimmers with pear, earth and spice."
France,87,18,Pinot Noir,red,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2015  Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Beaune,"Produced by the cooperative of the Hautes Côtes, this wine is bright and fruity. It has light tannins and warm, red cherry character. With its acidity and structure it could age, although not for long. Drink from 2018."
France,88,30,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Valandraud 2014 3 de Valandraud  (Saint-Émilion),"The third wine of Château Valandraud, this is a lighter version of the estate. With its generous tannins and concentration, it is smoky, full of blackberry fruits and the potential to age for a few years. Drink from 2020."
US,86,39,Merlot,red,Crane Family 2000 Don Raffaele Estate Merlot (Napa Valley),"A very strong wine of superior tannic and acid structure. You can feel the pedigree in your mouth, smooth, elegant and luscious. The fruit is as ripe as it might be. The flavors are earthy and tobaccoey, and the wine turns astringent on the finish."
US,86,35,Pinot Noir,red,Cru 2008 Appellations Series Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Made in an exaggerated tutti-fruity style, with candied raspberry and mocha flavors. The mouthfeel is nicely silky, with a brisk flourish of acidity. Drink now."
Italy,91,21,Red Blend,red,Volpaia 2013  Chianti Classico,"A delicious expression of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this opens with enticing aromas of fragrant purple flower, ripe red berry and sweet baking spice. The silky, vibrant palate doles out juicy wild cherry, black raspberry, clove and licorice while sleek tannins and bright acidity provide the framework. A tobacco note signals the close. Drink through 2018."
France,85,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Hyot 2011  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"This fresh and juicy wine is marked by berry fruits and acidity. It's bright and crisp in character, while also having weight and richness. With its soft tannins, it is ready to drink now."
US,81,8,Pinot Noir,red,Turning Leaf NV Pinot Noir (California),"Smells like pink bubblegum, tastes like sugary cherry pie filling. Even at this price, it's not a bargain."
US,89,44,Pinot Noir,red,Vista Hills 2010 Piedmont Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A distinctive streak of cola runs through this wine, along with a mix of wild strawberries and spice. It's elegant and seamless, doing a lovely, gentle fade into a lightly spicy finish."
Italy,89,23,White Blend,white,Marco Felluga 2012 Molamatta White (Collio),"Aromas of pear, pressed white flower, exotic fruit and hints of toasted oak lead the nose. The round palate offers nectarine zest, apricot, dried herb and vanilla alongside soft but refreshing acidity."
US,88,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Voss 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Grapefruit mixed with honey and some green veggies welcome you in, while the intriguing palate provides citrus, more honey, apricots and even some scallions. Simple and straightforward it's not; but it is fairly easy to drink. Served chilled on the front porch during the summer."
France,91,22,Riesling,white,Domaine Ehrhart 2006 Herrenweg Riesling (Alsace),"A bouquet of summer desserts—strawberry soup, apricot pie and lemon meringue pie—pull you into the glass. Although not quite as nuanced, the palate delivers enticing apricot and wet stone notes. The unctuous palate and noticeable residual sugar will partner well with fish in an Asian-fusion preparation."
France,89,16,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château de Parenchère 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur,"All the elements are present in this young wine. It has plenty of red fruit, touches of plum and spice. The tannins are firm while leaving plenty of room for the fruit. A wine that will be comfortably drinkable from 2018."
France,85,13,Merlot,red,Montpezat 2005 Les Enclos Prestige Merlot (Vin de Pays d'Oc),"An ambitious effort, this Pays d'Oc Merlot opens with bacon, earth and boysenberry notes that lead to a moderately intense palate. Vanilla notes wrap around flavors of Chinese tea, cedar and spice box and wind up with a fairly gripping finish. Drink now."
France,88,26,Chardonnay,white,Henri de Villamont 2009 Millénaire  (Bourgogne),"This is a dominated by new wood, but it still retains fragrant, fresh fruit. A touch of lemon pairs with the toast note, bearing refreshing acidity on the finish."
Italy,88,25,Red Blend,red,Cusumano 2013 Alta Mora Rosso  (Etna),"Subdued aromas suggest red berry and a hint of dried herb. The tight palate shows red raspberry, raw cherry and a hint of cinnamon while rather austere tannins and brisk acidity provide support."
US,89,16,Chardonnay,white,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2013 Unoaked Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Green melon, lime and lemon flavors ring fresh and pure in this unoaked Chardonnay. It's anchored by a bracing backbone of acidity, but the palate builds in richness and mouthfeel, finishing on a riper, slightly tropical fruit note."
France,91,80,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Haut Breton Larigaudière 2009  Margaux,"A densely tannic wine that is showing fine aging potential. It is well endowed with weight, acidity and ripe black currant fruits. With the rich fruit that opens slowly in the mouth, it has a fine combination of sweetness and structure. Age for 5–6 years."
US,87,15,Riesling,white,Lamoreaux Landing 2015 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Crushed stone and dried clay notes lend a distinctly earthen character to this dry light-bodied Riesling. Pressed apple and pear flavors on the palate are freshened by squirts of lime, lemon and a tart green-plum finish. The finish is long and lingering."
US,85,30,Chardonnay,white,Fox Run 2010 Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Savory notes of pressed apple and golden toast accent this bristling, bright sparkling Chardonnay. On the palate, thick, dense mouth-filling foam carries flavors of zesty lemon and pear speckled with savory herbs."
US,90,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Auclair 2013 96 Cedars Red (Red Mountain),"Aromas of wood spice, black licorice, graphite and blackberry are followed by cranberry and cherry flavors. It shows a fine sense of balance."
US,86,25,Pinot Noir,red,Stoller 2006 JV Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"JV Estate stands for junior vines; these young vines bring on sweet, candied flavors of berries and citrus. There's no depth here, but what's up front is fresh and fruity, if slightly sugary. The impression of granular sugar lingers into the midpalate, where some green tannins also appear. But for the price, this is a fine bottle for near-term enjoyment."
US,84,20,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Municipal Winemakers 2007 Bright Red Red (Santa Barbara County),"This southern Rhône-style blend is very soft and as sweet as a fruit pastry. It has jammy or pie-filling flavors of cherries, raspberries, red plums and cocoa, with a dusting of pepper and cinnamon."
US,86,15,Chardonnay,white,Cameron Hughes 2011 Lot 361 Chardonnay (Atlas Peak),"Plenty of crisp acidity balances the citrus, tropical fruit and pear flavors in this ripe Chardonnay. There's also a strong jacket of smoky oak with its buttered toast and vanilla richness. The result will please Chard lovers at a good price."
US,88,58,Pinot Noir,red,Dutton-Goldfield 2011 Azaya Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Marin County),"A testament to coolness—cool place, cool year—this Marin County Pinot is earthy, round and tight, suggesting it could use a little more time to develop. Cranberry and spice rule the roost and the wine's lightness of being would pair well with fresh-caught salmon not looking to be overwhelmed."
US,89,20,White Blend,white,Tenshen 2015 White (Central Coast),"Expertly light touches of banana, honey, pecan, tuberose and citrus peel show on the nose of this blend by Joey Tensley and Alex Guarachi. There is great energy and tension to the sip, with yellow-grapefruit-juice flavors. Crisp, this would be a great shellfish pairing."
US,87,38,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Raymond Burr 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Very dry and earthy, with tobacco, herb and blackberry flavors. Could be richer, but the structure is impeccable, and the wine is elegant. Ready now."
Italy,90,29,Red Blend,red,Contucci 2012  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,"Intensely floral violet and iris scents mingle with wild berry and new leather notes. The palate is youthfully austere, showing dried red cherry, star anise and clove flavors, with firm, fine-grained tannins that carry the finish. This needs a few more years to unwind and develop."
US,91,15,Syrah,red,J. Lohr 2014 Estates South Ridge Syrah (Paso Robles),"This bottling offers gingerbread cake, baked blueberry and smoked pork on the nose. It's soft on the palate, with finely polished tannins imparting a plush texture. Black plum, strawberry and a touch of mint mark the palate. The structure shows itself just enough on the finish."
France,88,50,Syrah,red,LePlan-Vermeersch 2009 GT-S Grand Terroir Syrah (Côtes du Rhône Villages),"Full bodied and thickly textured, this Southern Rhône Syrah combines cedar and vanilla notes from oak aging with notes of brandied cherries and a bit of asphalt. It's long on the finish, with a plush feel, then ends on a slightly bitter note."
US,87,28,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Miro 2011 Silverwood Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak),"This comes from a mountain-high vineyard atop a relatively new Sonoma County AVA that straddles into Mendocino County, too. Savory and herbal, the 100% Cab offers dark sour cherry and blackberry and plenty of tannin."
US,90,27,Syrah,red,Chateau Lafayette Reneau 2013 Syrah (Finger Lakes),"Hints of ceder, bramble and smoked nuts add savory complexity to this ripe, full-bodied Syrah full of succulent black cherry and berry flavors. It's approachable yet elegant, framed by soft, feathery tannins and a zesty spray of cranberry acidity add. Drink now through 2018."
France,91,65,Chardonnay,white,Ayala 2002 Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"Fresh apples, grapefruit and sweeter apricots all hang together well in this elegant Chardonnay. It's an apéritif style, its crispness giving a light character, the fruit floating over the acidity. There are lively green fruit flavors to finish."
US,91,48,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Sineann 2006 Baby Poux Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (OR)),"Right out of the chute this toasty, dark, dense, sexy wine says, “Drink me!” But some further time in bottle seems like the better plan. It's quite young, tight, still a bit awkward in the mouth, with the barrel and fruit flavors not quite integrated. All the right pieces are here—ripe black berries, cassis and cherries along with spicy herbal streaks and a whiff of coffee. Just let it all settle down before you pop the (glass) cork."
Italy,89,60,Red Blend,red,Poggio Mandorlo 2008 Red (Toscana),"Made from Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this structured red offers aromas of black currant, toast, graphite and a whiff of cedar. The firm palate offers coconut, coffee, grilled sage and red berry alongside bracing tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the fruit richness."
US,87,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Veramar 2016 JB Ameritage Red (Virginia),"Intense aromas of cran-grape juice, violets, lavender and cinnamon dominate the nose. The flavors are tart and floral, while the texture is smooth and easy with a fresh acidity. This finishes long and bright on a touch of sour cherry."
US,85,14,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Vin du Lac 2008 Savvy! Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Soft and fruity, a mix of apples and peaches, with a hint of toasted cracker. A simple, light Sauv Blanc that is smooth and easy-drinking."
US,93,58,Pinot Noir,red,Pali 2013 Huber VIneyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Tart, plump cherries show first on the nose of this great wine, with pressed violet petals, smashed eucalyptus, crushed menthol and fresh tea aromas playing background. The tip of the palate is soft with red fruit before a zesty kola-nut character invades on a wave of sharp, even ferocious acidity, finishing up on wild mint herbals."
US,86,20,Red Blend,red,James Wyatt 2013 Untamed Cuvée Red (Yakima Valley),"This lightly colored wine blends Grenache (43%), Syrah (32%) and Mourvèdre. It brings aromas of red raspberries, currant and flowers. The palate is fresh and lighter in style, with the emphasis on fruit."
US,93,78,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,En Garde 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"This is a limited-production offering from a tiny appellation, blended with small amounts of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Crème de cassis and Bing cherry give it an unexpected expansiveness of juicy texture, with jolts of tobacco and dried herb playing on the palate before a balanced finish wraps it up in a dry, resolved bow."
US,84,23,Merlot,red,Paradise Ridge 1999 Ladi's Vineyard Merlot (Sonoma County),"This is described as a country-style wine because of its rugged tannins and angular, rough mouthfeel. The deeply plummy flavors are ripe, but very dry. The biggest problem may be the acids, which are very low. You long for more crispness and life, something to offset the fruitiness."
Italy,87,15,Red Blend,red,Brunori 2012 Torquis  (Rosso Piceno),"Juicy black cherry and black berry take center stage in this blend of Montelpulciano and Sangiovese. There's a hint of white pepper and mint on the close, along with just enough freshness to lift this up. Not for cellaring, so enjoy soon. Worldwide Cellars, Sussex Wine Merchants."
France,88,49,Pinot Noir,red,Maurice Ecard 2013 Les Serpentières Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),"The texture and structure of this wine may be light but the fruitiness is so appealing. Soft and ripe with red-berry fruit flavors and refreshing acidity, it will develop quickly and be ready to drink from 2017."
US,85,12,Merlot,red,Magistrate 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Dry and a little sharp, with blackberry, currant, mocha, tea and herb flavors. The tannic astringency really needs rich grilled meats to balance it."
US,88,28,Red Blend,red,Sparkman 2010 Wilderness Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Fruity and dark, this is an excellent chugging wine. It's substantial without being tiring; the fruit is lively and has a somewhat earthy, wild edge to it. Immediately tasty, this is one to enjoy in its youth."
US,86,34,Pinot Noir,red,Reustle 2013 Pishon Bloc Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"A pretty faded rose color, this delicate wine shows very light raspberry and cherry fruit, with moderate, tea-flavored tannins, and barrel-generated streaks of coffee and dark chocolate."
US,87,25,Chardonnay,white,Rutherford Ranch 2015 Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros),"This wine's oaky entry derives from 10 months aging in French and American oak. It's creamy and voluptuous in style, with simple flavors of apple and a moderately long finish."
France,83,35,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Carrette 2013 Les Crays  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"This wine is perfumed, soft and with a light character. An oddly floral character doesn't jell with the fruitiness that is behind it."
Italy,85,13,Pinot Grigio,white,Santi 2002 Sortesele Pinot Grigio (Trentino),"Flavors of ripe peaches and fresh, clean fruit make for an immediately attractive wine. It is balanced with a layer of acidity and vibrant white currants."
US,89,7,Red Blend,red,Hogue 2008 Red Table Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Tart and juicy, this Cabernet/Merlot/Syrah blend matches cranberry and plum fruit flavors to milk chocolate and nougat highlights. Well-crafted, with a pleasing florality (to coin a word) in the finish. An outstanding value."
US,96,125,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Groth 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"A huge Cabernet, in the best sense of the word. It wasn't the easiest vintage, as 2007 was, but meticulous winemaking did the job, resulting in this amazingly rich, impressively ripe wine that's drinkable now and will develop for many years. The fruits veer toward blackberries, cherries and cola, and the tannins are soft and refined. One hundred percent new French oak isn't at all heavy, lending nuances of buttered toast and sweet wood tannins. Will easily age for 15 years."
US,90,22,Riesling,white,MaidenStoen 2014 Zabala Vineyard Riesling (Monterey County),"Mandarin-orange zest, cut Asian pear, lemon blossom and slight beeswax show on the fresh nose of this bottling by young winemaker Mike Callahan. It's extremely dry on the palate, like licking limestone, with hints of nectarine blossom and lemon-skin flavor."
France,90,40,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Clos Saint Michel 2009 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"This is a solid example of entry-level Châteauneuf-du-Pape. A cherry note is accented by hints of garrigue and chocolate, and the wine is richly textured, ripe and full bodied. Drink this blend of 40% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 30% Mourvèdre over the next several years."
US,85,15,Zinfandel,red,Peachy Canyon 2015 Incredible Red Zinfandel (California),"A bit weak on the nose, this bottling shows elderberry, raspberry and wet chaparral aromas. Sweet fruit shows blandly on the palate, with touches of sage and thyme."
US,92,36,Zinfandel,red,V. Sattui 2008 Ramazzotti Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A really good Zinfandel, and despite hefty alcohol, it's dry and balanced. Really delivers those Zin flavors of wild berries, leather, anise, cocoa and cola, and the spices are a wild ride through Asia. With thick, velvety tannins and acidity, it's a lovely, classy Zin to drink now."
US,92,115,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Etude 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"An austere nose gives way in time to smoky tobacco, red currant and minerally acidity, the wine intense on the palate without being over the top. Along the way, hits of cedar and milk chocolate complement the proceedings."
France,92,85,Pinot Noir,red,David Duband 2014  Gevrey-Chambertin,"From the northern end of the Gevrey-Chambertin appellation, this wine is ripe, floral and supple in texture. It has crisp red fruit and vibrant acidity, underpinned by ripe tannins. Developing quickly, it will be ready to drink from 2019."
US,92,42,Pinot Noir,red,Merry Edwards 2007 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Marked by fresh, sleek acidity and firm, dusty tannins, this is a Pinot to stash in the cellar for a while. It's just too tough and hard now. Give it 4–6 years to soften, and let the black cherries, red currants and cola mesh with the oak and transform with the magic of bottle age."
France,91,35,Riesling,white,Domaine Zinck 2009 Eichberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"This is a really fragrant wine, with white hedgerow flowers that introduce its rich, full body. It has just a touch of sweetness from the ripe pear and quince flavors, although the texture also has a fine edge of minerality. Age for another 1–2 years."
US,85,12,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Purple Star 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Ancient Lakes),"Aromas of citrus, tropical fruit and herb lead to just off-dry flavors with a lightly creamy feel."
US,93,85,Syrah,red,Terre Rouge 2009 Ascent Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"Terre Rouge's loftiest undertaking every vintage, this Ascent is a blockbuster. It's gorgeously spicy and floral, with dark notes of pepper, violet and herb that will live long and prosper in time. Grapes used for this bottling are sourced from cool, high-elevation vineyards, providing the wine perfect balance between big, bold fruit and provocative acidity."
US,88,39,Riesling,white,Lamoreaux Landing 2014 Ice Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Drizzles of honey coat the bounty of sun-kissed tangerines, apples and pears in this lip smackingly sweet Riesling ice wine. Dusty mineral tones and a welcome bite of astringency frame a long, meandering finish."
France,96,196,Chardonnay,white,Lanson 2006 Clos Lanson Chardonnay (Champagne),"The wine from this clos or walled vineyard in the city of Reims has spent eight years aging before disgorgement. It's a rare wine, with a wonderful balance between its toasty character and the crisp, dry apple and green-fruit flavors. It will certainly age further, so wait—if you can—until 2019."
US,92,50,Pinot Noir,red,Amalie Robert 2011 Pommard Clone Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The star of the single-clone lineup, this feels like a truly complete wine, with pinpoint focus. Complex fruit flavors mix berries and cherries with a touch of spice. Lively and detailed, this perfectly balanced wine does not push too hard, and delivers intriguing aromatics threaded with baking spices and a lingering finish. Drink 2020 through 2030."
US,90,85,Pinot Noir,red,Beacon Hill 2013 Chehalem Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Just one barrel was produced from the own-rooted vines planted almost 50 years ago. It's earthy and scented with a menthol/eucalyptus note, that carries on through. Cranberry flavor reflects the rather low alcohol, but there is no hint of unripeness or any vegetative character."
France,86,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Cheval Quancard 2014 Fortin Plaisance  (Saint-Émilion),"This ripe Saint-Émilion is generous with its rounded perfumed Merlot. It gives the wine richness, juicy acidity and an open texture. Touches of tannin do bring in some structure, but the emphasis is on the fruitiness and fresh aftertaste. Drink from late 2017."
US,91,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,J. Scott Cellars 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Southern Oregon),"With its vinicultural eye on New Zealand, this full-bodied and rich wine offers a mouth-filling mix of citrus and tropical fruits. It's lush and forward, dense with fruit and highlighted with lemon verbena. The overall effect is like sipping on a vinous lemon-drop cocktail. Quite delicious!"
US,87,38,Pinot Noir,red,Chehalem 1997 Rion Reserve Pinot Noir (Oregon),"The see-through strawberry color announces the lightness of the vintage. But it smells attractive and pleasant, with cedar and briar. In the mouth, it runs along a tart, lean line, again a reflection on the year. There's some Burgundian elegance, but only minimal depth of fruit. Overall a pretty wine best for drinking with food."
France,86,13,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Clos Moulin Pontet 2015  Bordeaux Supérieur,"The wine is bright and fruity with a youthful character of red-berry flavors. As this all calms down, the ripe fruit will show well, balanced by some firm tannins. Drink from 2018."
US,88,16,Pinot Grigio,white,Bargetto 2013 Pinot Grigio (Monterey County),"This is a great sunny day wine, starting with aromas of honeydew melon, ripe nectarine and lemongrass. There is a slightly peachy, bubblegum character once sipped, with lemon-lime soda in the midpalate and a flinty, gunmetal finish."
France,91,31,Red Blend,red,Mas de la Dame 2009 La Stèle Red (Les Baux de Provence),"This wine is still youthful, but solidly structured, dense and concentrated. It's dry in style but laden with fruits that have only begun to show through. Give this impressive wine several more years in the cellar. Drink from 2016."
France,87,13,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Maine d'Arman 2010  Côtes de Bourg,"Ripe and perfumed, this is packed with the richness of 2010 along with its structure. It has weight, juicy black and red berry fruits and a tense structure that still needs time. Acidity at the end provides a fresh lift to the essentially firm wine."
Italy,84,50,Red Blend,red,Rocca di Montegrossi 2009 Vigneto San Marcellino  (Chianti Classico),"This wine opens with aromas of burned tire rubber and asphalt. The palate offers bitter sensations of grilled sage, oak extract and roasted coffee beans alongside tongue-drying wood tannins."
France,84,16,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Bel Air 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur,"Soft, light and juicy, this is a fresh, strawberry-flavored wine. It has only the lightest tannic structure, with plenty of acidity and bright red fruits. This Ginestet wine is ready to drink."
US,91,25,Syrah,red,Zaca Mesa 2009 Estate Grown and Bottled Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"This is soft, smooth and refined, with rich, complex blackberry, cassis, bacon, pepper and smoky cedar flavors. Good as it is, it will develop bottle complexities over the next eight years. Almost as good as Zaca Mesa's more expensive Syrahs."
US,84,48,Pinot Noir,red,Vision Cellars 2006 Las Alturas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Too big by far for a Pinot Noir, this single-vineyard bottling is heavy-handed. It has caramelized cherry and blackberry fruit flavors and a soft, candied quality. Ultimately, it lacks the elegance and delicacy of a fine wine."
France,87,22,Chardonnay,white,La Chablisienne 2011 La Pierrelée  (Chablis),"One of the two main cuvées from La Chablisienne, the wine is fresh, fruity while having a tight, mineral character and a cool, fragrant feel. It could age for a few months, but is a wine to drink soon."
US,90,65,Pinot Noir,red,Lachini 2008 Cuvée Giselle Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"At first taste, this is a difficult wine to evaluate because of its tight, compact and tannic structure. Pomegranate and strawberry fruits slowly emerge from a shell of earthy tannins, suggesting that with a few more years in the bottle this will evolve into a broader, more expressive wine."
US,90,30,Riesling,white,Tierce 2010 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Smoky mineral notes add a mysterious tone to elegant stone fruit on the nose and palate of this dry, steely Riesling made collaboratively by three leading Finger Lakes wineries: Anthony Road, Fox Run and Red Newt. It's focused, but has a supple fleshiness that's both intense and enjoyable."
US,89,61,Pinot Noir,red,Testarossa 2012 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Savory aromas of bay leaf and fennel pair with mushrooms and freshly turned dirt on this single-vineyard wine. The flavors are also more earthy than fruity, with oregano, thyme, tea, espresso, cola and only a hint of cranberry. The tannins are strong, so this will last for a few years."
US,90,44,Pinot Noir,red,Pacific Ridge 2009 Red Label Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"A rich, tasty Pinot, packed with black cherry pie filling, cola, orange zest, star anise, cinnamon and sandalwood flavors that finish sweet and long. The texture is satisfying. Drink over the next several years."
US,93,52,Syrah,red,Gramercy 2012 The Deuce Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Fermented with 80% whole clusters and aged 18 months in neutral French oak, this outright delicious wine offers aromas of black and green olive, mineral, moist earth and dried herbs. It's seamless in feel, delivering lithe, pillowy soft fruit, savory flavors and a hyperextended finish. It's a testament to the strength of Syrah from this region."
France,90,69,Pinot Noir,red,Louis Jadot 2014  Gevrey-Chambertin,"Vines from a number of growers on the lower slopes of Gevrey-Chambertin contribute to this wine. It has the plentiful tannins typical of the village yet also exudes attractive juicy red fruit. It will need another year or two to show its best, so drink from 2019."
US,90,36,Chardonnay,white,Stubbs Vineyard 2009 Chardonnay (Marin County),"This shows its cool-climate origins thanks to the brisk acidity and keen minerality that accompany the orange, peach and oak flavors. It's elegant and rich, but don't drink it too cold."
US,87,26,Chardonnay,white,Anam Cara 2011 Nicholas Estate Chardonnay (Chehalem Mountains),"This is the first Chardonnay release from Anam Cara, estate grown from young vines, and softened by secondary fermentation. The flavors suggest almond and butter, light citrus, a whiff of toast and a taste of cracker. It's smooth, with a lemony finish."
US,86,19,Zinfandel,red,Chillhouse 2012 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Dense and concentrated strawberries mix with black rocks and gravel on the nose of this stylishly labeled bottle. The palate is somewhat sweet with blueberry and blackberry jam flavors, as well as earthy notes."
US,93,29,Chardonnay,white,K. Furtado 2009 Bien Nacido Vineyards Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Kevin Furtado is a sommelier in Vail who owns this brand. The grapes come from some of Bien Nacido's best blocks. The wine is exceptionally lush and complex, showing flashes of tropical fruits, honey and minerals, tightly wound together in a firm structure. A really fine Chardonnay that should hold for up to 6 years."
France,90,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Laulerie 2014 Comtesse de Ségur  (Montravel),"This wood-aged blend of Merlot and Malbec comes from the range of hills that continue from Saint-Emilion and Castillon in Bordeaux. There are similarities in the richness of this wine giving a fine balance between fruit and acidity. The tannins and the spice from wood aging are showing well, suggesting the wine will age. Drink from 2019."
US,90,52,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Tin Barn 2013 Pickberry Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Bold, succulent black cherry and currant flavors combine with softer, more elegant notions of graphite, coffee and clove in this well-made, full-bodied, 100% varietal wine. Volcanic soils comprise the Sonoma Mountain slope where the vineyard is located, contributing a gravelly hint of reduction."
US,90,40,Chardonnay,white,Landmark 2014 Flocchini Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Dark in color and voluptuous in body and texture, this wine was aged in French oak, 35% of it new. With a sizable presence on the palate, it generously reveals brooding flavors of apple and pear."
US,86,15,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Acre Twenty-one 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),The plum and blue fruit aromas and flavors don't seem entirely varietal but this still offers plenty of appeal. It's lightly sweet with a squeeze of tannins.
US,87,72,Pinot Noir,red,Williams Selyem 2008 Coastlands Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Rather heavy in texture, a big, full-bodied and tannic Pinot that seems overly extracted and oaky. The vintage was very difficult due to early September heat waves, and everything depended on exquisite timing. It's very good, despite the rusticity. Drink now through 2012."
US,92,30,Chardonnay,white,Lange 2009 Three Hills Cuvée Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This is a luscious, butterscotchy, fresh, lime- and lemon-flavored Chardonnay; a true delight. Melon and peach fruit flavors thread into the core, and the wine has a wonderful richness without losing its finesse or acid base."
US,91,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Black Stallion 2009 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Great price for a Cabernet this good. It's packed with classic varietal flavors of blackberries, cassis, plums and cocoa. The tannins are rich and ripe, with an elegantly pure Napa Valley structure. Not an ager, so drink soon."
US,92,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Mi Sueño 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Here's a fine, young Cabernet, rich in pastry-filling blackberries, cherries, black raspberries, cassis and sweet toasted oak notes. Already throwing some sediment, it should glide effortlessly through the next eight years, gaining bottle interest."
US,86,20,Pinot Noir,red,River Road 2011 Stephanie's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"Pretty good  Pinot for the price, showing Russian River silkiness, dryness and acidic structure. The cola, sour-cherry candy and persimmon flavors are classic, if a little thin. Drink up."
US,90,36,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Andrew Murray 2013 Esperance Curtis Vineyard Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"The man who makes a million Syrahs dives into a blend of 60% Grenache, 25% Mourvèdre and 15% Syrah on this bottling, which offers composting lilac, black pepper, fresh boysenberry, dried herb and a tarry quality on the nose. There's a strong blackberry-balsamic reduction flavor once sipped, as well as beef char, elderberry and more tar."
US,91,30,Zinfandel,red,Martin Ray 2013 Puccioni Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Structured despite its impermeable presence of power and alcohol, this wine also sings in crisp red fruit, some of it jammy, but self-possessed. An accompaniment of anise and baked bread play on the sturdy palate."
France,87,40,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Laffitte Carcasset 2012  Saint-Estèphe,"This smoky wine has firm tannins and a tough core. The juicy fruit is taking its time develop, although it will provide density and ripe berry fruits in time. The vineyard, created in the early 1980s, is now at peak maturity. Drink from 2017."
US,84,30,Zinfandel,red,Stella Monsi 2009 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Robust, tannic, spicy, the wine is also rich in wild berry, raisin and prune fruit. In other words, a rustic Zin to drink with barbecue. The official alcohol is 14.5% by volume, but it tastes hotter than that."
US,90,35,Syrah,red,Ferguson Crest 2011 Private Reserve Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas produces this label with her father and winemaker Joey Tensley, whose handiwork unleashes aromas of white pepper, black cherry, a cornucopia of dark berries and earthy minerality. Bright acidity on the palate partners with blackberry soda flavors, quite racy for the variety."
US,91,38,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Highway 12 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"A polished, complex wine to drink now, despite considerable tannins. Give it a decant for a few hours to let it mellow. Shows ripe blackberry, cherry, licorice, cola and smoky oak flavors that are young, intense and nervy in acids."
France,85,10,White Blend,white,Louis de Camponac 2015 White (Vin de France),"Aromas of yellow melon and flowers form the core of the bouquet, with additional hints of straw and grapefruit peel in the background. The light-weight palate offers good balance, with rich tropical-fruit tones of pineapple and mango that finish clean and mouthwatering."
France,92,59,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Joseph Mellot 2014 Grande Cuvée des Edvins  (Pouilly-Fumé),"In this wood-aged wine, the spice and toast show well against the ripe fruit. It's complex and rich while retaining a strong, fresh and herbal character. The wood aging means that the wine has some aging potential, so drink from 2018."
Italy,86,11,White Blend,white,Cantina Fratelli Pardi 2012 Colle di Giove  (Montefalco),"This simple offering opens with aromas of stone fruit and toasted almond. The palate offers yellow peach, apricot and citrus, with a hint of flint on the close."
France,85,12,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Briot 2011  Bordeaux,"Black currant fruits dominate this ripe, stalky wine that has young tannins and a smoky cedar character that comes from light wood aging. It's dry, firm and ready to drink."
US,93,145,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Castello di Amorosa 2010 Don Thomas Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"The vineyard is in Rutherford, and this 100% Cabernet does show the dusty tannins for which the commune is known. It's also very ripe and exuberant, with tiers of black and red cherry pie, currant and oak flavors, as well as a delicious, earthy note of green olives. Forward now, but should gain in the bottle over the next 10 years."
US,95,60,Syrah,red,Sleight of Hand 2013 Psychedelic Stoney Vine Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The winery's first release off its estate vineyard in The Rocks offers expressive, captivating aromas of peat, dried flowers, fire pit, herbs, grilled asparagus, funk and green olive. The flavors are sweet, sumptuous and rich, showing depth and detail. It's a knockout."
US,85,8,Chardonnay,white,Buffalo Grove 2012 Chardonnay (California),"This wine delivers a solid hit for the popular Chardonnay style, with oak-inspired orange and mango flavors, in a creamy package. For the price, it's a good buy."
US,90,38,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Walla Walla Vintners 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"There's no mistaking the variety with this wine's aromas of dried and fresh savory herbs, poblano, coffee, dark chocolate and cherry, accented by earthy undertones. The palate is deft while showing good depth of flavor and persistence."
US,85,22,Pinot Noir,red,Klee 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This has a strong impression of sweetness, to the point of being almost cloying. That candied raspberry flavor is offset with citrusy acids, giving it a sweet/tart candy character. The flavors don't quite sync up."
US,91,58,Pinot Noir,red,Dutton-Goldfield 2010 Azaya Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Marin County),"Comprised of ripe raspberry and cherry fruit; sweet, smoky new oak; and brisk, citrusy acidity; this dry Pinot Noir is fine and elegant. As for its ageability, all suggestions are to drink it over the next four years, before the fruit drops out."
France,93,35,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château de Fieuzal 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"Ripe and tropical, this full-bodied wine conveys mango, quince and ripe white peach that accompany a rich texture. It's going to develop relatively quickly, so drink from 2018. Winemaker Stephan Carrier returned from Napa to take over winemaking after Irish businessman Lochlann Quinn bought the property in 2001. A new winery and barrel cellar opened in 2011. Hubert de Boüard of Château Angelus consults with Carrier. Fieuzal's newsletter is an accurate report on harvests."
US,90,30,Riesling,white,Glenora 2010 Late Harvest Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Notes of sweet quince preserves, lilac and lavender gently perfume this aromatic late-harvest Riesling. Quite voluptuous in body, with rich fruit flavor and a lush, creamy texture, it finishes long, with a hint of sweetness that's balanced by brisk white-tea astringency."
France,88,13,Riesling,white,Willm 2009 Réserve Riesling (Alsace),"Crisp and steely, touched by white perfumes and intense acidity, this is a wine with a sharp blade of flavors that cut through the texture. Apples, citrus and kumquat all blend attractively together."
US,87,35,Syrah,red,Martella 2009 Fairbairn Ranch Syrah (Mendocino),"From a certified biodynamic vineyard, this Syrah is big red wine, tannic with black fruit and game in taste and smell."
US,94,65,Pinot Noir,red,Challen 2013 Bentrock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"The recent vintages from this Santa Maria-based winery of actress Challen Cates and winemaker Kevin Law are some of the most impressive wines out there. This is dark in the glass, with a rich bouquet of cinnamon-clove foam, black plum pudding and hot pastry. It hits the palate with panache and power, showing allspice, dried ginger and sharp cola notes atop rich black cherry fruit."
Italy,90,23,Red Blend,red,Le Pianelle 2013 Al Posto dei Fiori Rosato Red (Coste della Sesia),"A blend of Nebbiolo, Vespolina and Croatina, this boasts delicate floral and fruit aromas of white rose and wild berry. Juicy red cherry and fleshy strawberry drive the vibrant palate while hints of baking spice provide the backdrop."
US,85,22,Syrah,red,Consilience 2013 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Leather, shaved cocoa, smoked beef and purple fruit show on the nose of this wine. The palate offers touches of savory soy and smoked meat, but is dominated by sour boysenberry fruit."
Italy,87,16,Sangiovese,red,Tenuta Santo Pietro 2010 Pio II  (Chianti),"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this earthy wine leads off with aromas of red berries and wet soil. The juicy palate delivers wild cherry lightly accented with notes of white pepper alongside smooth tannins and fresh acidity. It's an ideal match with a variety of dishes, including pizza. Enjoy soon."
US,87,50,Red Blend,red,Three Rivers 2009 Svelte Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This vintage of Svelte is still rough around the edges, with chalky, slightly green tannins sticking out. The fruit seems to be hiding behind the earthy components, and some unusual flavors of bread dough and biscuit are also in the mix. This is a wine that's tough to sort out."
US,86,16,Syrah,red,Andrew Murray 2011 Tous les Jours Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"This is Murray's junior version of Syrah, less expensive than his Watch Hill bottling, but also not as charming. It's dry, tannic and a little sharp, with red currant, brown sugar and pepper flavors."
US,88,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Seven Bridges 2009 Elerding Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),"Made from Elerding Vineyard fruit, this wine is aged in 100% new oak for 24 months. It's dark and concentrated, and it deals attention-grabbing barrel-derived flavors of dark chocolate, licorice and espresso. The black cherry flavor has the grip and power to handle the barrel influence, but the wine will profit from additional bottle age."
US,88,25,Pinot Noir,red,Santa Barbara Winery 2013 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"A heavy chaparral element consumes the nose of this wine, with sagebrush, eucalyptus, pencil lead and just a touch of elderberry fruit. The palate is all about tart cranberries and sour cherries, with a bit of graphite minerality holding it together. It's a brisk and earthy sipper."
France,89,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Tertre de Viaud 2009  Côtes de Bourg,"A ripe, smoky wine, full of very juicy fruit. Black plums and berries are complemented by a core of firm tannins and bright acidity. Sweet, rich and attractive."
Italy,90,40,Red Blend,red,Argiolas 2012 Korem Red (Isola dei Nuraghi),"Aromas of black currant, grilled sage, toasted oak and eucalyptus lead the way on this full-bodied blend of Bovale, Carignano and Cannonau. The brooding palate offers tar, blackberry, grilled sage and black olive alongside gripping, fine-grained tannins."
Italy,89,31,Red Blend,red,Carpineto 2010 Riserva  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"Aromas of dried black-skinned fruit, cedar, charred earth and ground pepper lead the nose. The palate offers dried black cherry, ripe blackberry, clove, allspice and tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2018."
US,91,28,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Robert Mondavi 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A lovely young Cab, rich and balanced, and with the elegance you expect from this producer. Made from all 5 Bordeaux varieties, with a drop of Syrah, the wine is potent in red and black currant, blackberry and new oak flavors, with sweetly ripe tannins. Delicious now, it should develop through 2015."
US,89,40,Pinot Noir,red,Walnut City WineWorks 2014 La Cantera Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This wine's black cherry fruit, backed by tart acidity and ample tannins, quickly emerges. Cola and brown spice hints reflect its 15 months aging in 15% new French oak, yet it fades on the midpalate as if recently bottled. As with the Carlton Hill bottling, this should benefit from an additional year or two."
US,85,24,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Rancho Sisquoc 2006 Flood Family Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County),"Soft and tannic, with a sour candy-sweet taste, this Cab has flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, anise and cedar. Drink now."
US,89,30,Pinot Noir,red,WillaKenzie Estate 2013 Gisèle Pinot Noir,"WillaKenzie's most affordable estate-grown Pinot, this opens with a truly lovely bouquet of rose petals, raspberries and dusty chocolate. Soft and smooth upon entry, it's a light, detailed and sophisticated vineyard blend that spent 10 months in 20% new oak."
US,90,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Januik 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas are bright, with notes of green herb, vanilla, clove, wood spice and cherry. The palate brings a mouthful of dark-fruit flavors along with barrel accents, providing a whole lot of texture and appeal."
US,88,22,Syrah,red,Silver 2009 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Grape jelly, pipe smoke, lilac cologne, woody incense and a bit of tar show in the nose of this wine by Benjamin Silver, who's made wine for many years in a small warehouse on Santa Barbara's Eastside. Flavors of blackberry, wet tobacco, gamy meats and beef jerky are pleasantly rustic."
US,88,52,Zinfandel,red,Robert Biale 2015 Old Kraft Vineyard Zinfandel (St. Helena),"Weedy, herbal and strong-willed, this is a warm concentrated wine that's softly textured and moderate in structure. Extracted flavors of red cherry and vanilla accentuate the wine's succulent nature."
US,86,29,Chardonnay,white,Sutcliffe 2012 Chardonnay (Colorado),"Underripe melon meets butterscotch on the nose. The round palate shows banana-lemon yogurt with streaks of caramel, leading to a toasted vanilla finish."
US,88,45,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Grieve 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This 100% Sauvignon Blanc aspires to the New Zealand style of crispness and dryness. It succeeds on both levels, with fruity, oaky flavors of lemons, limes and honeydew melons. There's a strong note of gooseberries that make the wine tread a careful balance between ripeness and greenness. It's ripe, but just barely."
Italy,88,24,Red Blend,red,Mannucci Droandi 2013 Ceppeto  (Chianti Classico),"Made with organically farmed grapes, this opens with aromas of tilled earth, leather, truffle and mature berry. The chewy palate doles out juicy Marasca cherry, licorice, clove and aromatic herb framed in velvety tannins. Enjoy through 2018."
US,88,35,Syrah,red,Amalie Robert 2008 Satisfaction Syrah (Willamette Valley),"Impressively dark and showing the meaty andpeppery character of the grape, this Willamette Valley Syrah makes a good ¬argument for the viability of the grape up north. It emphasizes the flavors that are lost in a hotter climate—pepper, herb, tart berry, and juicy acidity. With alcohol at 12.3%, this sets a new standard for domestic, Euro-style Syrah."
Italy,88,24,Red Blend,red,Jacùss 2007 Tazzelenghe Red (Colli Orientali del Friuli),Tazzelenghe is a fascinating red varietal from northeast Italy that almost faced extinction before it was rediscovered just a few years ago. It offers density and richness that is enhanced by red cherry and blackberry spice.
France,95,279,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Faiveley 2014  Echézeaux,"Firmly structured, this dark wine has smoky tannins and intense acidity combined in a texture that is dusty, almost dry at the core. Over this the ripe red fruits are spread thickly, giving a powerful concentrated wine that will age well. Drink from 2022."
US,83,22,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Quivira 2012 Fig Tree Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),"Unripe green notes of leaves detract from this wine's enjoyment. It's crisp in acidity, with some pure Meyer lemon, lime and fig flavors, but that vegetal note is bothersome."
US,93,64,Chardonnay,white,Liquid Farm 2014 Bien Bien Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"This powerfully textured white wine from Bien Nacido Vineyard will last for ages. Tightly wound on the nose with lime pith, limestone, Brie cheese rind and a touch of flint, the palate shows scorched Meyer lemon wedges and some seared orange pith. The mouthfeel is tremendously grippy. Drink 2017–2024."
US,91,30,Pinot Noir,red,Stoller 2013 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Pretty aromas of fresh-picked raspberries and cherries invite you into this lovely young Pinot. It's fresh as a spring day, with perfect balance and clarity. Drink now through 2018–2020."
US,86,50,Chardonnay,white,Andretti 2012 Montona Reserve Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Oaky flavors of buttered toast and vanilla bean dominate this Chardonnay. It's also ripe in mango, pear, apricot and orange flavors allied with acidity. But the overall quality is average."
US,85,11,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Little Black Dress 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"A vibrantly fruity wine, with lemon, lime, pineapple and grapefruit flavors brightened with zesty acidity. It's basically dryish to off-dry, with a touch of honey on the finish. Good price for an easy cocktail sipper."
Italy,90,65,Red Blend,red,Lornano 2010 Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),"Fresh and fragrant, this offers aromas of rose and violet with a whiff of woodland berry. The elegant palate delivers bright red cherry, crushed strawberry, clove and peppercorn alongside polished tannins and fresh acidity. Drink through 2020."
US,86,32,Syrah,red,Hawk Watch Winery 2013 Syrah (South Coast),"There's a touch of barnyard on the nose of this bottling, which also shows a soy and sweet black cherry scents. The palate is marked by beef char and cooked black fruit flavors, with a twist of funkiness, lending intrigue."
Italy,88,14,Red Blend,red,Cecchi 2012  Chianti,"Aromas of underbrush, leather and blue flower lead the nose on this blend of Sangiovese and 15% Colorino and Canaiolo. The fresh, easy-drinking palate delivers wild cherry, raspberry and a hint of licorice alongside supple tannins."
Italy,92,30,Red Blend,red,Castello di Fonterutoli 2012 Ser Lapo Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Sangiovese and 10% Merlot are behind this savory red. It opens with aromas of plum, blue flower, forest floor and baking spice. The aromas follow through to the elegantly structured palate, along with juicy black cherry crushed raspberry, clove and tobacco."
France,90,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Feret Lambert 2011  Bordeaux Supérieur,"Solid and dense, this is a concentrated wine. It has black plum flavors and a feeling of ripeness and ease. Sweet acidity shows strongly on the finish. Drink from 2015."
US,93,50,Pinot Noir,red,Bonaccorsi 2008 Melville Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"A burst of black cherry fruit and spice announces this rich, complex young Pinot. Shows great structure in the fine tannins, brisk acids and firm minerality. Brims with power and assertiveness, and should develop over the next six years."
US,85,10,Chardonnay,white,Beringer 2015 Founders' Estate Chardonnay (California),"Mildly fruity and very smooth in texture, this wine is quietly agreeable. It is medium to full bodied, feels rich on the palate and tastes ripe and subtle like honeydew melon."
France,85,13,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Bougrier 2015 Alain de la Treille Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France),"There is only the faintest of aromas on this soft, lightly juicy wine. It is a warm-climate wine, rounded, soft and gentle. The freshness comes at the end, bright and with a citrus touch."
US,88,56,Syrah,red,Ascension Cellars 2010 Mayhem Syrah (Paso Robles),"There's lots of upfront blackberry, currant and cherry fruit in this Syrah, along with savory, meaty notes of sweet bacon and charred meat. With complex tannins but fairly soft acidity, it's an ambitious, delicious wine."
France,87,16,Riesling,white,La Cave des Vignerons de Pfaffenheim 2012 Pfaff Tradition Riesling (Alsace),"With immediately attractive white flower aromas, this is a delicate, fruity and lightly textured wine. The trio of flavors includes citrus, lime zest and squeezed pink grapefruit, with fresh juicy acidity that gives a clean, bright aftertaste."
US,86,30,Pinot Noir,red,Paul Dolan 2010 Pinot Noir (Potter Valley),"A straightforward Pinot Noir from Mendocino's inland Potter Valley, the wine is dominated by a layer of spearmint that overcomes the more nuanced flavors of cherry and raspberry."
US,92,75,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Serene 2014 Clos du Soleil Vineyard Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),"This cuvée starts out quite sharp and tight, and will want decanting and/or further bottle age to show its best. Notes of steel, stone, toast and butterscotch candy annotate tightly-packed orange, apricot and peach fruit, with some high-toned aromatics. The components are all in place for a wine that should age gracefully for a decade or longer. Drink now through 2026."
US,90,28,Zinfandel,red,Kokomo 2013 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Spicy and refined in black and white pepper, this memorable red traffics in all the classic characteristics of leather and tobacco with dark, brooding red and black fruit. Medium in body and length, it finishes with a refreshing element of black cherry and cola, calling out for barbecued meat treated with the same care."
US,93,100,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Etude 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Dry and dusty, this lovely Cab shows red cherry sour candy, red currant, violet flower and smoky cedar flavors. The tannins are significant. It's a wine that needs time, but it should be very fine after 2011 and for several years after."
France,88,23,Chardonnay,white,Nicolas Maillet 2008  Mâcon-Villages,"A wine that seems designed for some aging, with youthful green fruits, a vibrant texture of apple juice and good depth of flavor."
Italy,92,42,Red Blend,red,Cusumano 2008 Noà Red (Sicilia),"A blend of Nero d'Avola, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, the 2008 vintage of Noà shows excellent concentration and intensity with lingering tones of ripe blackberry, cinnamon, wet earth and Graham cracker. It's a bold red wine, but the distinctive Nero d'Avola personality comes through nicely, linking the wine to its territory."
US,85,10,Zinfandel,red,Renwood 2005 Zinfandel (Sierra Foothills),"Here's a solid everyday Zin, lusty and rustic, offering up a big gulp of fruity flavor. Blackberries, cherries, mulberries, root beer, licorice, and just about every spice you can name shows up. It's a dry, tannic wine that will love rich, fatty meats and cheeses."
US,86,35,Syrah,red,Manzoni 2006 Paraiso Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"The trick with growing Syrah in the Highlands is hitting the sweet spot between ripeness and its opposite. This bottling certainly achieves very fruity black currant, dark chocolate, pepper and root beer flavors that are delicious. It has a sharpness throughout that detracts from the lush feeling, but that sharpness may go away with some time in the bottle."
France,92,90,Pinot Noir,red,Olivier Leflaive 2010 Santenots Premier Cru  (Volnay),"For the moment, the tannins are still firm and the generous red fruits have not yet penetrated the surface. The acidity is present, like a line of brightness that cuts through this richly tannic wine. This is a potentially opulent wine."
US,86,27,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Bennett Family 2005 The Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"From a label owned by William Grant & Sons, this rich Napa Cab meets expectations with its fine tannic structure and ripe, oak-influenced flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate and spice. As sweet as the wine is in the mouth, it actually finishes thoroughly dry."
US,88,95,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Raymond 2013 District Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga),"This medium-bodied, nicely firm and approachable red shows cherry, cassis, tobacco and black olive along a juicy core of grippy texture."
France,87,24,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Barreyres 2011  Haut-Médoc,"This is a dry, structured wine, with dry tannins and stalky fruit characteristics. However, it will develop into a fruity wine without great depth but with attractive berry flavors and acidity. Drink from 2016."
US,87,28,Zinfandel,red,Bourassa Vineyards 2005 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"With its blast of briary, brambly wild berries and black pepper, this is a classic Zin. The lusty flavors range through blackberries and cherries and mulberries to cola and root beer. Despite the hefty tannins, it's ready now with grilled meats or pasta with tomato sauce."
US,88,30,Pinot Noir,red,Paul Dolan 2012 Pinot Noir (Potter Valley),"A good grip of acidity and tannins shape the fruity, earthy aromas and crisp raspberry and cranberry flavors. It's a very lively, refreshing style that is not overripe, and will be great with all kinds of food."
US,91,25,Merlot,red,Olsen Estates 2008 Merlot (Yakima Valley),"The best of Olsen's 2008 reds, this 100% Merlot is generous and forward, with rich cherry and raspberry fruit. Spicy in the nose and in the mouth, it is lightly herbal, adding texture and length, and has the concentration and depth to develop nicely over the next decade."
US,85,28,Chardonnay,white,Bowman Cellars 2015 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Aged entirely in neutral French oak, this wine takes a light, simplistic approach in its presentation of golden honey apple and pear flavor."
US,87,18,Chardonnay,white,Arrowood 2001 Grand Archer Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"A very fruity, exceptionally ripe wine, filled with sun-pure flavors of green apple, white peach, pear, and nutmeg. Oak plays a supporting role throughout. Finishes with a honey and pepper richness."
France,90,25,Red Blend,red,Domaine de la Vallongue 2010 Garrigues Red (Les Baux de Provence),"While firmly tannic and structured, this wine shows youth with its concentrated fresh berry flavors and bright acidity. The dry core promises a long-term future, so don't drink before 2016."
Italy,89,26,Sangiovese,red,Folonari 2013 Torcalvano  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"Enticing blue flower, rose, new leather and graphite scents lead the nose. The vibrant if rather slender palate offers tart cherry, chopped herb and a saline note, framed by firm, fine-grained tannins."
US,87,8,Zinfandel,red,Twisted 2013 Old Vine Zinfandel (California),"Pure, focused fruit flavors like raspberry and red cherry light up this medium-bodied wine. A lively texture of crisp acidity and light tannins adds great balance to the effusive fruitiness. For such a friendly price, what else could one ask for?"
US,88,30,Red Blend,red,Galante 2011 Rancho Galante Estate Bottled Red (Carmel Valley),"Wood aromas of cedar are expertly spliced with purple fruits on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Petite Sirah and Merlot. A touch of greenness on the palate gives those deep purple fruits some depth, but the tannins are quite gripping, and should release more with time. Drink 2018 onward."
US,87,25,Chardonnay,white,Falcone 2010 Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Good and easy to like, but too oaky by half, with smoky char flavors dominating. Underneath that is a crisply dry, minerally Chardonnay, with fine orange and Meyer lemon flavors. It would be nice to try this as an unoaked wine."
France,84,13,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine Begude 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de Pays d'Oc),"Crisp acidity marks this mouthwatering white. Intense aromas of lemon and grass make for an intriguing nose. The palate is a bit dull, although the acidity gives the minerally finish a bit of staying power and makes it a good foil for fresh seafood."
US,86,28,Chardonnay,white,Cru 2012 Appellation Series Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This rich, good Chardonnay is easy to drink. The tropical fruit, apricot and peach flavors are accented with oak, and balanced with acidity."
France,93,90,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Joseph Mellot 2014 Cuvée Pierre Etienne  (Sancerre),"This is a wood-aged wine, named after the founder of the Mellot dynasty in the 16th century. It is richly endowed, packed with fine white fruit that contrasts with the stony steely texture. There is a great tang of acidity and orange zest at the end. The wine is still young and will repay cellaring until 2018."
France,86,19,Chardonnay,white,Domaine des Deux Roches 2015 Tradition  (Saint-Véran),"Crisp and lively, this is a tight and mineral wine. Baked-apple fruitiness is balanced by bright acidity and a tangy aftertaste. Drink from 2018."
Italy,90,25,Chardonnay,white,Castello di Monsanto 2009 Fabrizio Bianchi Chardonnay (Toscana),"There's a soothing, silky quality to this sunny Tuscan Chardonnay that sets it apart in a crowd. The wine is aged in both stainless steel and oak in order to maintain its fresh aromas of apricot and candied citrus as well as the richness of its texture."
US,93,42,Chardonnay,white,Foundry 2013 Courtney's Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Grapefruit blossoms, Meyer lemon skin and faints hint of tropical, white peach-flavored crème brûlée unite for a sleek and dynamic nose on this bottling of four grape clones. Vanilla, lemon zest and flavors of limes cooked in butter show on the delicious palate."
Italy,91,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Felsina 2012 Maestro Raro Cabernet Sauvignon (Toscana),"This 100% Cabernet has scents of ripe black-skinned fruit, aromatic herb, new leather, baking spice and a balsamic note. The round savory palate offers black currant, stewed prune, herb, clove and a hint of star anise alongside polished, fine-grained tannins. Drink over the next several years."
US,85,35,Syrah,red,Borra 2008 47.5 Degree Limited Release Syrah Syrah (Clements Hills),"Jammy and yet still savory, a fairly straightforward Syrah from the Clements Hills area of Lodi, small production (240 cases), 100% varietal and made using native fermentation, the wine has solid tannin structure and a heady texture, but could use more oomph on the finish."
France,93,191,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Jacques Prieur 2014 Les Combettes Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),"Great white fruits, hints of peach and tight citrus-zest texture all give this wine its great freshness. At the same time the texture suggests minerality and a nervy edge. Hints of the wood are just right for this intensely fruity wine."
US,94,75,Pinot Noir,red,Winderlea 2012 Winderlea Legacy Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"The Legacy estate reserve sources the original mid-1970s vines. It's a delicate, high-wire act, balanced on a bed of rose petals. From the floral aromatics into flavors of red currant and black cherry, it takes you on a well-modulated joyride. Veins of anise, cola and clay add complexity, as the details expand into a lingering finish. Drink 2015–2030."
US,86,20,Pinot Noir,red,Coelho 2010 Atração Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"At first this shows some earthy, volatile aromas. The mineral-driven palate has tart, slightly bitter fruit flavors, suggesting crabapple and wild berry."
US,93,80,Syrah,red,Gorman 2012 Black Curtain Reserve Syrah (Red Mountain),"Closed up tightly, this wine is not yet entirely ready to reveal its charms. Over time it offers aromas of blackberry, huckleberry, bittersweet chocolate, barrel spices and mineral. True to the house style, it pulls no punches with creamy feeling, rich black and blue fruit flavors that sail into the distance. Give it time to open up."
US,89,23,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Reustle 2013 Prayer Rock Vineyards Talitha Cumi Bloc Sauvignon Blanc (Umpqua Valley),"Unmistakably Sauvignon Blanc, it carries notes of herbs, citrus and guava. It's lightly spritzy and drinks dry with mouthwatering citrus flavors. Try it with shellfish."
US,89,26,Pinot Noir,red,Scenic Valley Farms 2015 Vitae Springs Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Dark and toasty, this wild yeast fermented wine spent 10 months in 10% new Oregon oak. Slightly roasted flavors combine coffee grounds, chunky cherry and cassis. It's a full-bodied full-flavored wine which favors power over finesse."
US,87,44,Syrah,red,Bunnell 2011 Syrah (Red Mountain),"The aromas of green herb and dark berries give the perception of being underripe, with a green undertone along with notes of black licorice. The palate is elegant in style, pulling up toward the finish."
US,89,15,Riesling,white,Hosmer 2013 Dry Riesling (Cayuga Lake),"Zesty lemon peel and blossom notes are invigorating and fresh on this dry, delicately framed wine. It's concentrated with tropical mango and melon flavors, yet zippy with lime acidity. It finishes long with an elegant mineral touch."
US,87,18,Chardonnay,white,Pull 2013 Chardonnay (Paso Robles),"Poached pears, yellow apples and a touch of butter show on the classic nose of this Chardonnay that holds to steely frame. Very sharp acidity kicks off the sip, where Pink Lady apples and warm vanilla surround a tight minerality. It's both sharp and slightly sweet."
US,94,250,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Alpha Omega 2012 Sunshine Valley Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oak Knoll District),"This lovely 100% varietal wine aged just under two years in 80% new French oak shows a strong spicy clove character that's layered with cranberry and cherry fruit. Dusty mocha and integrated oak notes meet crisp acidity, maintaining freshness through all that power."
US,83,38,Pinot Noir,red,Highway 12 2012 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Rustic and leathery, the fruit is held back behind the barnyard aspects of this wine's bouquet and grainy palate, making it tough to figure varietally."
US,88,10,Pinot Gris,white,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2015 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),Pinot Gris has been making inroads in Washington of late and this producer has been leading the way. Pleasing aromas of apple and melon lead to dry full-feeling fruit flavors that linger on the finish.
US,87,24,Pinot Noir,red,Spindrift Cellars 2005 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This zippy, fruit-forward wine opens with bright raspberry and pungent spice aromas, adding in milk chocolate streaks through a supple, medium-weight middle. The finish gets a little tight, with some plastic flavors creeping in."
US,92,30,Pinot Noir,red,Sinor-LaVallee 2013 Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"Mike Sinor puts most of his Bassi Ranch fruit, which grows just 1.3 miles from the Shell Beach seafront, into this bottling, which shows ginger snaps, iron, cinnamon, strawberry fruit and black slate on the nose. The palate is tight, focused and driven by rocky minerals, offering just enough cranberry juice to keep it delicious."
US,85,11,Chardonnay,white,Snapping Turtle 2010 Chardonnay (California),"Pretty good for a California-appellated Chard at this price, showing ripe flavors of pineapples, pears and green apples, with a touch of smoky vanilla from oak. Finishes a little too sweet, but lots of people will like that."
US,93,40,Pinot Noir,red,Harper Voit 2014 Strandline Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Smoky, chewy and dense, this is stacked with plum and black-cherry fruit. Strong streaks of cola and dark chocolate add complexity, with lightly dusty tannins supporting the extended finish."
US,91,42,Pinot Noir,red,Sojourn 2015 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This bright, focused wine with tense acidity blends fruit from five vineyards across the appellation. Silky tannins enwrap its nuanced dark cherry and wild strawberry flavors tinged with earth."
France,90,42,Chardonnay,white,Château de Lavernette 2014 Cuvée Jean-Jacques de Boissieu  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"This is a ripe mango and pineapple flavored wine. It is rich, generous and with a fine balance between acidity and the bold fruitiness. It is young and fruity, ready to drink although it will be even better from 2018."
US,84,15,Pinot Noir,red,Stephen Vincent 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"Smoky funkiness permeates this wine, which is lean on the palate and mushy in terms of structure. Cherry and pepper are the most distinguishable characteristics before the quick finish."
France,85,20,Chardonnay,white,Domaine de la Denante 2014  Saint-Véran,"Ripe and smooth, this rich wine has enough fruitiness and acidity to give a crisper edge, although it is more about a warm, spicy character. Drink now."
US,87,14,Riesling,white,Bonterra 2011 Riesling (Lake County-Mendocino County),"Bonterra's Riesling is off dry in style with a bright palate full of sweet applesauce and floral notes. It's light and crisp with lemony layers that finish long. This is a well-priced Riesing for a range of palates, and made from organically-grown grapes. Pair with something super spicy."
US,86,20,Chardonnay,white,Cinnabar 2014 Chardonnay (Monterey),"Fresh apple rinds, squeezed Mexican lime and a touch of guava show on the nose of this crisp yet tropical-tinged bottling. The flavors also start light with citrus and then delve into more guava-led tropicality, approaching ripe tuberose-flower pungency."
US,90,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,William Church 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Vibrant aromas of black plum, cassis, dried leather, licorice and herb lead to full, sweet, soft-feeling dark fruit flavors that linger."
US,93,50,Pinot Noir,red,Rideau 2015 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Underripe raspberry, green-olive, dewy herbs, green-peppercorn and cardamom aromas show on the herbaceous nose. All of those elements are interwoven on the sip, where a core of fruit punch is laced by bay leaf, kalamata olive, bergamot and Christmas spice that persist deep into the finish."
US,84,42,Zinfandel,red,2Plank 2014 Zinfandel (Amador County),"This superripe, late-harvest style of wine smells like raisins and dried plums. It tastes so fruity and ripe that it's sweet, with a full body to match. It would be best as a dessert wine."
US,92,35,Zinfandel,red,Carol Shelton 2012 Florence Vineyard Rocky Reserve Zinfandel (Rockpile),"From a 1,400-foot-high site, this wine combines 86% Zinfandel with 14% Petite Sirah, which deliciously exude blackberry, blueberry, kirsch and leather. Smooth, soft and juicy, it adds nutmeg, chocolate and oak as it goes, finishing with structure and length. Drink now through 2021."
US,83,10,Zinfandel,red,Glen Ellen 2007 Proprietor's Reserve Old Vine Zinfandel (California),"Weedy and vegetal despite some decent raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. Okay for a big party where nobody's fussy."
France,91,18,Red Blend,red,Producteurs Plaimont 2007 Collection Plaimont Red (Madiran),"The aroma is earthy, while on the palate this wine shows a full-bodied structure and rich, chewy black fruits. There is minerality here, a very textured wine offering spice as well as blackberry and plum-skin flavors."
US,90,52,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Palumbo Family Vineyards 2012 Tre Fratelli Red (Temecula Valley),"One of the promising wineries in the region presents this elegant blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc, which shows dill, mint, black peppercorns, beef char and blackberry-blueberry fruit on the nose. The blackberry and plum-led palate picks up tobacco, oregano, dark spice and more charred-beef notes."
US,84,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Fazeli Cellars 2009 Khayyam Cabernet Sauvignon (Temecula Valley),"Complicated, at times confusingly dank aromas of mushrooms, hops, dill and other wet herbs emerge from this bottling. Those atypical varietal characters find their way onto the palate as well, with olive and stewed mushrooms leading the way."
France,85,22,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Bréhat 2010  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"Minty aromas go along with firm, barely bitter tannins. They dominate the wine, smothering the fruit and lending a burnt quality to the palate."
Italy,85,15,Chardonnay,white,Villa Rubini 2006 Chardonnay (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"This is an easy-going, clean Chardonnay that delivers pretty aromas of creamy peach, mature apricot and honey. It is compact and balanced and would pair well with Chinese take-out or summer salads."
US,86,40,Pinot Noir,red,Lucia 2010 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is ripe and fruity wine. A hit of acidity lends some structure to the raspberry, cherry and cola flavors."
France,85,40,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Trouillet 2015 Coeur de Pouilly  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"This is a simple, fruity wine. It has a pear flavor, light minerality and a zingy aftertaste. Smooth and rounded, it looks as though it will be ready to drink from early 2017."
Italy,85,12,Red Blend,red,Sella & Mosca 1996 Raím Red (Isola dei Nuraghi),"The grapes are Carignan and Merlot. Raim translates as “grape” in the Catalan dialect spoken in some parts of Sardinia. The aromas are light cherry plus some Brettanomyces. On the palate, you experience a full-bodied, well-balanced structure with some rough tannins. The finish is long, showing cherry and earth components. An interesting wine with grilled meats."
US,93,32,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Brander 2015 au Naturel Sauvignon Blanc,"Freshly cut quince, guava, lemongrass and key lime aromas combine with a stony quality on the nose of this vibrant, zesty wine. Its acidity is almost effervescent, infusing the palate with boundless energy, while its chalky grip carries sharp green apple notes alongside warmer touches of pineapple and guava. Those vivid flavors linger for a full minute."
US,88,49,Pinot Noir,red,Signaterra 2009 Bella Luna Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Made in a sweetly ripe, oaky manner, this is a drink-me-now Pinot Noir. Easy to like for its jammy raspberry, cherry and Dr. Pepper cola flavors. The acidity and soft tannins define the modern Russian River style."
US,88,45,Red Blend,red,Jamesport 2007 Jubilant Reserve Red (North Fork of Long Island),"Hints of spice and leather add a savory tone to red cherry and plum flavors in this bold but elegantly structured red wine. The palate is juicy with fruit, but accented with a spray of green herbs and brisk acidity that lend freshness."
France,94,305,Chardonnay,white,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2011  Corton-Charlemagne,"Big and rich, this is a broad, open version of Corton-Charlemagne, a powerhouse of ripe white and yellow fruits. It seems initially without enough depth, a product of its youth, then gradually the ripe structure shows through, promising aging over 6–7 years."
US,88,14,Merlot,red,Cambridge & Sunset 2014 California Series Merlot (California),"Tasty and true to type, this wine smells like ripe plums and cherries accented by dried thyme, and tastes slightly meaty on top of all that fruitiness. It's a smooth-textured wine in which moderate tannins add a good bite to the mouthfeel."
France,92,65,Pinot Noir,red,Chanson Père et Fils 2005 Clos du Roi Premier Cru  (Beaune),"The first mouthful reveals a wine that is just plain opulent and rich. Only on the second taste do dense tannins push their way in, a structure that is concentrated, dry and tight. The fruit flavors are also forward, strawberry juice touched with cranberry juice dryness. This could age well, give it 4–5 years."
France,84,12,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Vinadeis 2016 Le Val Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France),"This warm style of Sauvignon Blanc has easygoing acidity and gooseberry fruit flavors. It's lightly tangy, with a bright, crisp texture."
US,87,20,Chardonnay,white,Krutz 2012 Inspiration Vineyard Magnolia Series Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Krutz has blended this Chardonnay to drink now. The wine shows varietal flavors of tropical fruits, with a creamy note from lees aging and oaky notes of buttered toast."
France,94,250,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Bertagna 2008 Clos Saint-Denis  (Clos Saint-Denis),"A finely balanced wine, with acidity, a soft texture, new wood and flavors of cocoa and smoke. There is beautiful red cherry fruit, laced with spice and buried tannins for aging. Keep this impressive wine for 6-7 years."
US,87,25,Pinot Noir,red,Wine Spots 2012 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Juicy raspberry, strawberry, orange zest, vanilla and oatmeal cookie flavors abound in this succulent Pinot Noir. It has a nice, silky texture, and the alcohol is refreshingly moderate."
US,91,62,Pinot Noir,red,Saintsbury 2014 Stanly Ranch Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Velvety on the palate, this is a rich, unctuous wine, showy in full-bodied waves of baked cherry, tar and minty earth. With a substantial weight, it will appeal to fans of a bigger style while retaining plenty of varietal character."
US,94,45,Pinot Noir,red,Davis Family 2009 Horshehoe Bend Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The winery's '08 bottling of this Pinot was very good, but this is considerably better. It's rich in red cherries and ripe persimmons, with complex notes of grilled beef, cola and sautéed wild mushrooms, and has a long, spicy finish. A joy to drink now, and it will develop bottle nuances over the next six years."
France,86,30,Chardonnay,white,Jaffelin 2013  Pouilly-Fuissé,"Structured, mineral and tense, this is a classic Pouilly Fuissé. It has lemon and crisp sliced white fruits, very linear in character with a bright, tight texture. The wine is young and could age until 2016."
US,87,28,White Blend,white,Eponymous 2013 Proprietary White (Carneros),"Crisp green apple and lime zest aromas form the entry of this unidentified blend, which tends toward richer, creamier layers of vanilla in flavor and texture. The finish is both full-figured and floral."
France,88,15,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Mission Saint Vincent 2016  Bordeaux Blanc,"This crisp, clean wine has both fruit and acidity in just the right proportions. With lively acidity and hint of herbal and citrus flavors, it is a fine apéritif style. The aftertaste continues this bright and lively character."
US,91,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Mark Ryan 2014 Old Vines Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is 100% varietal with the fruit coming from Ciel du Cheval, Red Willow and Phinny Hill vineyards. Expressive but still wound-up aromas of exotic spice, French oak, chocolate and dark fruit are followed by pitch-black fruit flavors and tightly wound tannins. It's not yet ready to fully reveal its charms but has the stuffing to go the distance."
US,95,95,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Venge 2013 Bone Ash Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga),"From the producer's own dry-farmed estate, this is a concentrated, full-bodied expression of the grape at its best, dense in chocolate and blackberry, almost syrup-like in its heady, brambly style. Burly integrated tannin create a significant foundation of weight and length, that's completely ready to be enjoyed now, yet may take on further nuance through 2023."
US,93,40,Chardonnay,white,Lange 2015 Three Hills Cuvée Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This wine is all Dijon clone, aged in two- to four-year-old puncheons. Bright and aromatic, it opens with a toasty scent and a mix of lemony citrus, pineapple and banana fruit. It's smooth and delicious and nicely layered, with an enduring finish."
France,92,40,Pinot Gris,white,Martin Schaetzel 2013 Eichberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Rounded, ripe notes of fresh and stewed pear sweeten nose and palate against a fine backbone of bright lemony acidity. There is the slightest nutty touch adding texture to that fruity freshness which leaves the palate just off-dry."
US,83,55,Pinot Noir,red,Armanino Family Cellars 2013 The Pintail Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"There's something mushroomy and feral about this wine, which finishes with sour cherry."
France,88,33,Pinot Noir,red,Patriarche Père et Fils 2013 En Caradeux Premier Cru  (Pernand-Vergelesses),"The cool character of this under-rated appellation is apparent in this red-currant-dominated wine. With a fresh streak of acidity, the wood and spice flavors are contained and balanced. The wine will be ready to drink from 2018."
France,85,14,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Allégret 2012  Entre-Deux-Mers,"Young, herbaceous wine, very fruity and lightly perfumed. It is crisp and delicate, with its citrus and pineapple fruits already lively and fresh."
US,88,45,Merlot,red,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"You might want to age this for a couple years, because it's a little tough in tannins, more so than you might expect from a Napa Merlot. But it's very rich in cherry, red currant, green olive and oak flavors."
US,89,40,Syrah,red,Bella 2008 Lily Hill Estate Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"Here's a sophisticated Syrah, elegant enough to drink with fine meat and poultry dishes. It's completely dry and rich in tannins, with complex blackberry, leather, pepper and sandalwood flavors. If it had more concentration it would be an ager. Drink now–2013."
France,87,65,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Pierre Guillemot 2015 Aux Serpentières Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),The wine is juicy with intense acidity. Its red-currant flavor is consistent with this acidity. Tannins are firm and will soften. The juicy aftertaste gives the wine crispness.
US,91,38,Chardonnay,white,Wm. Harrison 2015 Sangiacomo Family Vineyards Chardonnay (Carneros),"Sparkling richness stars in this concentrated, ultimately balanced wine, which offers a warming note of pear compote and peach within subtle waves of toasted oak. The lushly cradled fruit is awash in anise and fennel."
US,84,40,Pinot Noir,red,Francis Ford Coppola 2014 Dutton Ranch Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A pretty label created by film production designer Dean Tavoularis graces the bottle of this wine. It offers a mix of tight-grained tannin, cherry cola and smoky oak."
France,87,11,White Blend,white,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2015 Villa Chambre d'Amour White (Vin de France),"An off-dry blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Gros Manseng, this comes from the French southwest. Named after a sandy beach in the Basque Country, the wine has that cool feel of ocean breezes. Honey and lemon flavors are right up front to give a wine that is both fresh and beautifully fragrant."
Italy,87,24,Pinot Grigio,white,Poggiobello 2014 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Colli Orientali),"This opens with aromas of hay, pressed yellow flower and orchard fruit. The direct palate offers yellow apple skin, toasted nut and a mineral note alongside invigorating acidity."
France,83,14,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château de Marsan 2014  Bordeaux Clairet,There is a rosé here struggling to get out. This wine has strawberry fruits combined with tannins in a way that does not work. Bordeaux Clairet lies between rosé and red in color and in taste.
Italy,97,170,White Blend,white,Avignonesi 1997 375ml  (Vin Santo di Montepulciano),"Made with Malvasia Toscano and Trebbiano grapes (unlike the slightly more complex Occhio di Pernice Vin Santo, which is made from Sangiovese), this is a delightfully rich and concentrated sweet wine that boasts unreal levels of intensity and personality. The wine is smooth and round with lingering notes of brown sugar, roasted almond, melted sugar, dried apricots and figs."
France,88,15,Chardonnay,white,Louis Jadot 2008  Mâcon-Lugny,"Fresh and bright, dominated by its citrus and almond flavors. It has a soft, creamy texture, with highlights of orange zest, green plums and a great burst of acidity."
US,86,30,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,San Antonio 2007 Cask 520 Red (Paso Robles),"Soft and creamy, like a chocolate and black raspberry drink, sprinkled with pepper and cinnamon. Almost like a Port in its sweetness."
US,89,37,Pinot Noir,red,MacMurray Ranch 2010 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a rich, delicious Pinot Noir. It spreads a fantail of raspberry and cherry jam sweetness across the palate, and then the acidity kicks in, providing fortunate balance. With a silky texture, it's a lovely wine to drink now."
US,84,15,Chardonnay,white,V. Sattui 2001 Sattui Family Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"An unbalanced wine despite some pretty apple and peach flavors, an overlay of oak, and a creamy smooth texture. The parts are nice but somehow they don't knit together and the wine feels disjointed. Turns quite bitter on the finish."
US,87,25,Red Blend,red,Rock Wall 2012 Super Alamedan Red (California),"Made from Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel, this is one of Rock Wall's drier, lower-alcohol wines. It's high in acidity, with a silky mouthfeel. A little rustic, it shows cherry skin, tobacco and white pepper flavors."
US,92,32,Syrah,red,JM Cellars 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Purple-black, with rich scents of bright boysenberry fruit, and an unusual earthy umami note that adds depth to the finish. Sharp, young, acidic and grapy, this drinks like a younger wine."
US,90,38,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Mark Ryan 2014 The Dissident Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up 75% of this wine, with the balance Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Aromas of smoke, herb, red and black fruit and spice are followed by plentiful dark-fruit flavors. It delivers a sense of hedonism."
US,84,11,Red Blend,red,Pedroncelli 2010 friends.red Red (Sonoma County),"This is a simple red wine that's rustic, bearing flavors of raspberry and cherry Lifesaver candy and Dr. Pepper cola."
US,86,48,Red Blend,red,Elsom Cellars 2008 Isabella Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The prune and raisin scents and flavors suggest that some of these grapes were picked past optimal ripeness. For those who favor an almost Port-like style, this Bordeaux-style blend will hit the mark. The finish suggests figs lightly splashed with balsamic vinegar."
US,94,59,Pinot Noir,red,Big Basin 2013 Woodruff Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Relatively light in color, this lower-alcohol wine from a vineyard in the Corralitos area shows dried rose petals, bergamot, lavender, cinnamon and a tiny bit of mushroomy funk on the nose. Once sipped, pomegranate, dark cranberry and orange-peel elements are lifted by pencil lead, rosemary and a strong thyme component."
US,92,42,Pinot Noir,red,Cebada 2012 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Ynez Valley),"From an estate just northwest of the already rather western Sta. Rita Hills appellation, this mashes up raspberry, oak tree roots, black tea and vanilla on the nose. The flavors are crisp and clean with red fruit, brown spice and just enough tannins and acidity."
US,84,14,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Peirano 2006 The Heritage Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"A little green, with mint flavors accompanying the modest blackberries and cherries. The wine is 100% varietal. Shows promise, but needs greater concentration, even if the price has to be higher."
US,92,30,Pinot Noir,red,Sineann 2015 Wy'east Reserve Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"The reserve is bottled only in 375-ml bottles, and in extremely limited quantities. The extra ripeness is evident in both the alcohol content and the overall mouthfeel. For some tasters it will push this ahead of the regular Wy'east, though some detail is sacrificed along the way. Dense, almost chunky, it brings big bites of chocolate and nougat along with solid flavors of cherry cola. Drink now through 2020."
France,87,11,White Blend,white,Vignobles 46N118 2013 Blanc 32 White (Côtes de Gascogne),"Because of the cool Atlantic climate, the Gascogne region is home to many bright, crisp wines. This is fruity, fresh and utterly crisp while also having some hints of melon and peach flavors. A touch of attractive minerality gives the wine texture. Drink now."
US,92,120,Pinot Noir,red,Evening Land 2008 Occidental Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Tough to appreciate now due to its acidity and tannins, which lock it down behind a cloak of impenetrability. There are exotic wild raspberry and cherry fruit, cola, licorice, Provençal herb, bacon and pepper flavors, but you can't quite get to them, because they're behind bars. Obviously needs time. Give it 3–5 years in the cellar, and it should begin to blossom after that."
Italy,87,16,Red Blend,red,Castello di Meleto 2012 Borgaio Red (Toscana),"Here's an easygoing blend of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Merlot that offers blue flowers and red berry aromas that carry over to the palate along with a hint of white pepper. Supple tannins support the bright, juicy flavors. Drink through 2016."
US,84,60,Merlot,red,Provenance Vineyards 2005 Beckstoffer Las Amigas Vineyard Merlot (Carneros),"A little unbalanced, with some overripe, pruny flavors and heat from high alcohol. The lack of fruity richness accentuates the tannins. Drink up."
Italy,86,32,Sangiovese,red,Terralsole 2012  Rosso di Montalcino,"Scorched earth, dry underbrush and chopped aromatic herb aromas lift out of the glass. The lean palate is rather evolved, showing dried cherry, espresso and a hint of anise alongside fine-grained tannins."
US,90,50,Syrah,red,Deerfield Ranch NV Tawny Estate Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"Made entirely from Syrah grown on its property across multiple vintages, and then cave-aged six years in American oak, this is a nice dessert wine, raisiny and brimming in Christmas spice. With plenty of body and acidity, it swims effortlessly and smoothly on the palate, a bite of decadence that will work well with rich cheeses."
US,90,48,Chardonnay,white,Kerloo 2015 Calling Club Exclusive Chardonnay (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"Fermented and aged in neutral French oak with full malolactic fermentation, the aromas are light, with notes of green apple and mineral. The freshly squeezed lemon acids are tart and racy, capped off by a lightly creamy finish. Pair it with food to see it at its best."
US,83,12,Syrah,red,Big House 2007 The Slammer Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Very dry and rather sharp in acidity, this Syrah offers cherry-berry flavors with a hint of herbs and spices. It turns bitter on the finish. Good price, but could use greater richness."
Italy,90,25,Sangiovese,red,Rocca di Montemassi 2006 Sassabruna  (Monteregio di Massa Marittima),"Sassabruna is a Sangiovese-based wine with an added component of Syrah and Merlot that adds spice, consistency and fruitiness. Aromas here include red cherry, leather, black berry and vanilla bean."
Italy,87,12,White Blend,white,Vigneti del Vulture 2011 Pipoli White (Basilicata),"This blend of Greco and Fiano shows a dry note of crushed mineral, followed by notes of peach, honey and a touch of spice and lemon zest. Pair this with Thai mango salad."
US,89,13,Chardonnay,white,Lamoreaux Landing 2010 Estate Bottled Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Fresh, crisp apple and pear are touched with delicate swathes of cream and oyster shell on this elegant, impeccably balanced Chardonnay. The palate is brisk with lemon and lime acidity, but builds in richness and texture on the finish. A remarkable value at $13."
US,86,10,Pinot Grigio,white,Belle Ambiance 2015 Pinot Grigio (California),"This wine has more body and a richer mouthfeel than many of its peers, with mild floral and almond flavors and a touch of butterscotch."
US,91,95,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Rasa 2014 For the Love of the Game Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"This is a single vineyard, 100% varietal wine, aged in 70% new French oak. It draws you into the glass, with notes of char, fig, blackberry, spice and coffee. The dark-roasted coffee and dark-fruit flavors show precision and detail, lingering on the finish. The wood is primary at present but should integrate with time."
Italy,86,23,Sangiovese,red,Val di Suga 2014  Rosso di Montalcino,"The nose on this red is a bit shy but eventually reveals aromas suggesting moist underbrush, crushed berry and a whisper of violet. The simple light-bodied palate offers sour cherry, tart cranberry and a hint of orange peel. It's on the slender side, with firm acidity and loose-knit tannins."
Italy,89,22,Sangiovese,red,Castello Banfi 1998  Rosso di Montalcino,"This is a large-scaled rosso, and oak is used here lavishly but gracefully.  Aromas of game, leather, and dill open to dark plum and licorice flavors and a dense feel on the palate.  Moderate tannins show up on the long finish, accompnaied by lots of toasty oak and licorice notes."
US,91,42,Pinot Noir,red,WesMar 2013 Balletto Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A light, clear and bright wine from the heart of the appellation, this bottling exudes juicy layers of earthy cardamom spice and dark black cherry. It's well integrated and varietally consistent, offering jolts of minerality that buoy the texture."
US,90,40,Pinot Noir,red,Maison L'Envoyé 2012 The Attaché Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The Attaché brings appealing and lively cherry fruit, framed with citrusy acidity. The power in this wine is all forward and fruit-driven. It's quite good, but more for immediate drinking than cellaring."
France,87,12,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Briot 2012  Bordeaux Blanc,"Crisp, lightly herbaceous wine with a delicious creamy apple and pear character. This is finely balanced with a lively, crisp aftertaste. Screwcap."
US,94,44,Pinot Noir,red,De Loach 2009 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Pinot Noir just doesn't get richer than this. It floods the mouth with ripe flavors of raspberries and cherries, with fascinatingly earthy things, like truffles and pine cones. Vibrant acidity and a hint of furry tannins give it a fine structure. This upscale Pinot Noir is drinkable now and should evolve over the next six years."
US,95,90,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Quilceda Creek 2009 Palengat Red Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Quilceda's single-vineyard Bordeaux-style blend is 86% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc and 6% Merlot. This has fine grained tannins—not soft, but polished, ripe, and rich. Tasted prior to its official release, the wine was still pulling together all of the complex barrel-influenced flavors; it tasted delicious, with notes of bourbon-soaked cherries, along with veins of espresso, cacao, dusty baking spice, and a liquorous finish."
US,92,20,Riesling,white,Chateau Ste. Michelle & Dr. Loosen 2012 Eroica Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Continuing a long-running streak of excellence, the latest vintage of Eroica blends fruit from vineyards in the Lake Chelan, Yakima Valley, Royal Slope and Horse Heaven Hills regions. It's a rich mix of peach and papaya, creamy and slightly sweet (16.6 g/L). The citrusy acids keep a fine edge on the lush flavors."
US,95,48,Pinot Noir,red,Winderlea 2014 Weber Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"For 2014, the Weber is the star of a very fine Winderlea lineup. Dark and deeply concentrated, it's jammed with black cherry fruit, annotated with anise and showing a hint of gunmetal. The tannins are ripe and taste of clean earth. This is a fine candidate for aging. Drink now through 2030."
US,87,18,Chardonnay,white,Fog Alley 2007 Unoaked Chardonnay (Central Coast),"Tastes like it comes from Edna Valley, with its dryness, great burst of juicy acidity and jammy Mandarin orange, lime, kiwi and Meyer lemon flavors. Great with crab cakes dressed in a mango salsa."
France,90,32,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Fourrey 2014 Côte de Lechet Premier Cru  (Chablis),"From the coolest of the Premier Cru vineyards, this is a crisp wine, packed with minerality as well as tight green fruits. The aftertaste with its flinty edge is spicy as well as deliciously fruity. Drink from 2018."
France,90,15,Chardonnay,white,Kirkland Signature 2014 Signature Series Premier Cru  (Chablis),"Made by major Chablis producer Jean-Marc Brocard, this wine is ripe, soft and attractively fruity. It has crisp acidity along with rich yellow fruits and a touch of minerality. The wine comes from a blend of different premier cru vineyards. Delicious and refreshing, it is ready to drink now."
US,86,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Mercer 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Horse Heaven Hills),"Coming from a warm region in a hot vintage, this wine leans into the tropical with aromas of kiwi and mango, with herb and citrus notes providing accents. The flavors are lean and tart, with the concentration light."
Italy,87,25,Sangiovese,red,Poderi dal Nespoli 1929 2010 Il Nespoli Riserva  (Sangiovese di Romagna Superiore),"Dark fruit and astringent tannins make for a bold and hearty first impression. This Sangiovese Riserva opens with a dark inky color and delivers aromas of prune, plum, cola, tar and old spice. Pair it with aged Pecorino cheese."
France,90,16,Red Blend,red,Château Coutinel 2013 Red (Fronton),"This flowery, perfumed wine is full of red currants and berries that balance a solid, dry element. With the potential of rounding out and becoming rich as well as structured, it should be cellared. Drink from 2017."
US,87,19,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Eberle 2009 Vineyard Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"A good, everyday wine showing how well Paso Robles ripens Cabernet. It's filled with savory blackberry and cherry flavors that go down nice and easy, leading to a spicy finish. Drink now–2014."
France,85,12,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Motte Maucourt 2015  Bordeaux Supérieur,The wine has red fruits and tannins along with acidity. The 25-year old vines have produced a rich wine that is all about fruit and acidity. Drink from 2018.
US,90,30,Merlot,red,Januik 2014 Klipsun Vineyard Merlot (Red Mountain),"This leads with plum, vanilla, barrel spice and herb aromas. The palate is soft and velvety, keeping the vineyard's often burly tannins well in check and providing a lot of textural appeal. Cocoa notes linger on the finish, delivering a yum factor that is hard to ignore."
US,92,64,Pinot Noir,red,Testarossa 2014 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Comprised solely of the richer 667 clone, this bottling from the Talley family's iconic vineyard offers juicy blackberry, chipped slate, fennel frond and cola notes on the nose. Smashed black raspberry, strawberry and boysenberry are front-loaded on the palate, but then comes the underlying rush of thyme and anise."
US,90,17,Riesling,white,Keuka Spring 2016 Semi-Sweet Riesling (Finger Lakes),"While bountiful in ripe, plush nectarine, peach and melon, this medium-sweet Riesling off sets its sunny side with dazzling acidity. Light on its feet yet deeply penetrating, it's an effortless people pleaser offering balance and satisfaction."
US,85,107,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Mellisoni 2013 M Series Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This seems like it came from a considerably cooler vintage and also like it has had some age. Light aromas of herb, wood spice, medicine cabinet, leather and mesquite are followed by tart light-bodied cranberry flavors. The tannins bring a slight sense of astringency."
US,90,40,Syrah,red,Fielding Hills 2013 Estate Riverbend Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"Vanilla, clove, baking spice and dark fruit aromas lead to a palate plush with full ripe generous fruit and barrel flavors. It's a hedonistic delight, with the barrel influence playing a prominent role."
US,90,28,Red Blend,red,Waxwing 2014 Red (California),"This is a peppery, deep wine that's fun to explore. It has black pepper and roasted meat aromas, dry flavors like cranberry and pomegranate, and a good, firm texture that begs for beef bourguignon or pot roast."
US,90,30,Pinot Noir,red,McGregor 2010 Reserve Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),"This wine highlights heady new-oak tones of spice, vanilla and cedar, yet maintains elegance from nose to finish. Ripe black cherry and plum flavors penetrate on the palate, with a framing of soft tannins and bright cranberry acidity. The finish is long and a touch mineral."
Italy,84,20,Red Blend,red,Bindi Sergardi 2011 La Ghirlanda  (Chianti Classico),"This wine has aromas of oak, red currants and roasted coffee bean. Oak dominates the palate, with toasted sensations and espresso taking center stage over the subdued red fruit sensation. Overall, this is dried up and tannic, closing on an astringent note of wood tannins. Veritas Imports, Tanaro River Imports, Crown."
US,86,17,Merlot,red,Chelsea Goldschmidt 2014 Merlot (Alexander Valley),"This is a fine wine, reflective of the vintage's generosity and approachable nature, giving off flavors of vanilla, cherry and currant alongside a sanguine, gamey character and smoky full-bodied ripeness."
US,87,26,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Glenwood Cellars 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Coast),"Subdued in just-ripe cantaloupe, this light wine dances in lemon, lime and grapefruit, skirting the line between delightful and sour. Midweight, it allows a touch of oak on the back palate to intermingle with the fruit."
US,87,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,B.R. Cohn 2011 Silver Label Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast),"B.R. Cohn's more widely made Cab, this wine is sourced from multiple vineyards in Sonoma, Mendocino and Lake counties. Exhibiting currant, cranberry and mint on the nose and palate, it's restrained in texture, quite linear, with a quick, robust finish."
France,93,29,Chardonnay,white,Boeckel 2012 Extra Brut Chardonnay (Crémant d'Alsace),"Notes of chalk, bread and stone precede the bruised apple notes on this beautiful, elegant vintage Crémant. On the palate, the apple notes become fuller and rounder and appear like mellow, baked Golden Delicious. There is purity, structure and precision in the autolytic notes which are supported by pure citrus and apple freshness, leaving the palate impressed but not weighed down. Hints of spice develop in the background while all the freshness makes for a lip-smacking, long and savory finish."
Italy,90,50,Red Blend,red,Castello di Monsanto 2010 Il Poggio Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Aromas of underbrush, tilled soil, toast and espresso lead the nose. The firmly structured palate offers ripe black cherry, blackberry, coffee, anise and grilled herb alongside assertive tannins that need to unwind. Drink 1016–2020."
US,89,150,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Frank Family 2010 Winston Hill Red (Rutherford),"As rich as this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is, and it is extraordinarily rich, there's something standard about it. It's as though the ripeness of the fruit has obliterated any trace of terroir. Offers a fantastically sweet explosion of blackberries, cherries, plums and chocolate, alongside caramelized, butterscotchy oak, but beyond the sheer power, the wine isn't displaying much subtlety. Hard to tell where it's going, if anywhere."
US,96,110,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Kendall-Jackson 2004 Stature Red (Napa Valley),"Stature is always a Bordeaux blend, but varies in vineyard source each year. This '04 is soft, utterly delicious and fully drinkable now. It's rich in black currant, cherry pie filling, plum, anise and spice flavors, generously aged in smoky new oak. Made in the modern style, it will hold effortlessly through 2012, at least."
US,93,72,Pinot Noir,red,Roark Wine Co. 2015 Burning Creek Ranch Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"There is much to like about the youthful vibrancy of this wine from Texas-raised Ryan Roark. It packs bright and fruity raspberry, pomegranate, hibiscus and crushed violet aromas on the nose. The refreshing palate pairs snappy raspberry fruit with fennel pollen and eucalyptus touches."
US,81,50,Zinfandel,red,Mazzocco 2006 Reserve West Dry Creek Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"As sweet as Port, with chocolate and prune flavors. Feels as hot as a chile pepper, with nearly 17% alcohol."
US,90,40,Chardonnay,white,Bernardus 2010 Rosella's Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This shows the rich, ripe, opulent fruit that always accompanies the Chardonnays of this vineyard. Spicy, tart pineapples, oranges and mangoes are the flavors, with a jacket of sweet, smoky oak. The acidity is bright, giving it balance. Drink now."
US,91,62,Pinot Noir,red,Saintsbury 2014 Sundawg Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"Cranberry and strawberry make for a pretty, fruity wine that's velvety in texture and full bodied in depth and length. Black tea and a backbeat of orange and lemon add to the tartness of this layered, complex red."
France,90,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Vignerons de Buzet 2011 Château de Gueyze Red (Buzet),"The wine comes from a 196-acre property on the first slopes above the Garonne river. Made from the classic Bordeaux blend, it has been aged in wood which gives the intense perfumed, toasty character. The wine is dense, tannic with layers of black fruits. It needs to age more, so drink from 2016."
US,90,35,Red Blend,red,Tildio 2005 Profundo Red Wine Red (Wahluke Slope),"A full-boat, five-varietal Bordeaux blend. It's nicely balanced, and retains some inviting aromas of violets and candied rose petals, leading into a lip-smacking, fruit-driven mid-palate with blueberries, boysenberries and a whisper of saffron and chocolate. There is plenty of acid underpinning, and a judicious use of barrels that keeps the fruit front and center. The best yet from Tildio."
US,88,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Liberty Lake 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"Aged 40 months in French and Russian oak, this leads with green herb, bell pepper, vanilla, cherry and spice aromas and follows through with ripe black cherry flavors. The nose and palate seem disconnected, the green notes unusual for the appellation and vintage."
US,86,8,Zinfandel,red,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2010 Zinfandel (California),"A solid Zinfandel, dry and stylish. Not a blockbuster, just a well-crafted wine that offers nice berry, cherry, tobacco and spice flavors."
US,84,18,Syrah,red,Corkscrew 2013 Rosé of Syrah (Sonoma Coast),"Dark red in color, there's an intense—for lack of a better word—grapy quality to this rustic wine. Kirsch and orange highlight the experience, before a faint structure falls short on the finish."
Italy,95,130,Sangiovese,red,Uccelliera 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"There's a lot to like on this bold, fragrant wine, starting with aromas of leather, scorched earth, grilled herb and ripe black-skinned fruit. The hearty palate offers mouthfuls of juicy black cherry, raspberry jam, licorice, vanilla and cinnamon framed in robust, velvety tannins. The fruit richness seamlessly offsets the hefty abv. Drink 2018–2025."
France,91,26,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Tardieu-Laurent 2011 Guy Louis Red (Côtes du Rhône),"This is strongly marked by toasty, cedary oak, but enough fruit comes through on the midpalate and finish to suggest this is more than just another oaky red. It's rich and creamy through the midpalate, then finishes long, with mixed berry notes emerging at the end."
US,84,33,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Rosemont 2013 Kilravock Red (Virginia),"This blend of 33% Cabernet Franc, 27% Merlot, 27% Petit Verdot and 13% Cabernet Sauvignon is mildly concentrated on the nose and palate, with rubbery blackberry, cranberry juice and geranium leading the way. Light bodied, with a soft grip of tannins, these flavors lead to a short finish of green peppercorn."
US,88,15,Chardonnay,white,Malibu Rocky Oaks 2013 Collective Chardonnay (California),"Crisp, clean aromas of Asian pear, Pink Lady apple, dried pineapple and a touch of dried melon show on the nose of this wine from a group of Malibu vintners. The palate shows ripe apple and brown-pear flavors, with a bubblegum twist and lime-juice acidity."
US,88,19,Sangiovese,red,Monte Volpe 2013 Sangiovese (Mendocino County),"Light spicy, earthy aromas, tart raspberry and cranberry flavors and a firmly tannic texure add up to a well-structured and rather lean-tasting wine. It makes a good accompaniment to food."
US,81,12,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Peirano 2010 Heritage Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"This Lodi Cabernet is priced to sell, but it has a sweltering swath of green pepper."
US,88,16,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Michael David 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Lodi),"This medium-bodied, unbaked wine has light butter and fig aromas that lead to vivid citrus flavors and a good crisp balance. The wine is nicely dry, well-balanced and refreshing."
US,89,27,Chardonnay,white,Edna Valley Vineyard 2011 Fleur de Edna Winemaker Series Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"Brightened with zesty, lime-juice acidity and a cooling minerality, this Chardonnay features ripe, forward tropical fruit, orange and peach flavors, with a touch of buttered toast and vanilla. It's fancy enough to drink now with shellfish, tuna tartare, stuffed mushrooms, tempura, or even an upscale pizza."
US,87,17,Pinot Gris,white,Anthony Road 2016 Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),"Pristine white grapefruit and pear are accented by hints of fennel and saffron in this light-bodied, dry Pinot Gris. Sunny lemony acidity lends a soft, yielding feel to the palate."
Italy,94,120,Red Blend,red,Grattamacco 2007  Bolgheri Superiore,"This rich blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese) opens with pretty chocolate tones followed by opulent cherry, spice, leather, tobacco and cola. This is a well shaped and focused wine with a linear, elegant feel in the mouth capped by soft, chewy texture."
France,84,40,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Vrignaud 2011  Chablis,"Soft and ripe, this Chablis has white fruit and citrus flavors. The palate reveals a yeasty character that intrudes on the fresh fruit."
France,91,18,Pinot Gris,white,Domaine Jean Sipp 2014 Réserve Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Appetizing and warmly generous pear notes characterize the nose. The palate has the same, friendly fruit, boosted by some residual sugar. The plump fruit is countered by ample lemony freshness that creates an inherent balance. The finish is just off dry, but very refreshing."
US,86,22,Pinot Noir,red,Fog Theory 2013 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"There's a touch of smoke and jerky on the nose of this wine, with dried cranberry and some tar aromas also present. The smoked-meat element also shows on the tip of the palate, then gives way to tart cranberry and graphite, offering decent complexity with lingering woodsmoke."
US,87,55,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Bonterra 2009 The Butler Red (Mendocino County),"A brick color on the rim agrees with very tasty and mature flavors to indicate this wine should be enjoyed now. It smells like dried leaves on the forest floor, and tastes rather beefy and savory in flavor with hints of Worcestershire sauce and balsamic vinegar. It is medium to full bodied and smooth in texture."
US,88,28,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Raymond 2013 Estate Collection Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Fleshy and dry, this voluptuous wine has an abundance of creamy weight on the palate, but it never veers too far, remaining balanced and ultimately elegant. Stone fruit and quince vie for attention, with a salty undertow of lemongrass and ginger."
US,90,16,Chardonnay,white,Great American Wine Company 2013 Chardonnay (California),"In this wine, a core of juicy apple and Anjour pear flavors is dressed with light vanilla, nutmeg and cream accents for a beautiful, airy wine that's dry and not at all heavy. Baking spices linger on the long, vibrant finish."
France,89,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Clément-Pichon 2012  Haut-Médoc,"Under the same ownership as Château la Dominique in Saint-Émilion, Clément-Pichon has produced a richly juicy 2012. Firm structure underlies the generous fruits, while the acidity and the dry core of tannins promise good aging. Drink from 2017."
US,91,145,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Castello di Amorosa 2012 Don Thomas Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"On the western edge of the appellation, this vineyard provides a juicy, dusty core of full-bodied tannins and black cherry, a generous expression of ripe fruit with a complex edge. It finishes with touches of broth and tomato leaf."
US,88,20,Syrah,red,McClean X 2010 One Last Syrah Syrah (California),"Cherry candy, vanilla liqueur and spearmint rise to the nose of this well priced wine by Steve McClean. Dark chocolate-covered cherries and a prominent black pepper character show on the palate."
US,86,19,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Ott & Murphy 2010 Double Bluff Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Syrah comprises more than half of this spicy, Rhône-style blend, which also includes Grenache and Cinsault. A scent of wild berry introduces this wine, which feels sharp and carries a hint of pickle barrel, though no American oak is indicated. The palate broadens to display a flavor of strawberry compote and a whiff of chocolate."
US,90,45,Red Blend,red,CUTT 2013 Fearless Red (Napa Valley),"The producer concocts this fun blend every year from different varieties, this vintage a combination of 58% Syrah, 32% Zinfandel and 10% Grenache. Funky earth and mushroom meet thick, full-bodied waves of blueberry and blackberry bramble, riding smooth, textured waves of big, lengthy flavor."
US,93,85,Pinot Noir,red,Iron Horse 2013 Thomas Road Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"This is the producer's highest and most westerly vineyard site. It holds back from the start, still tightly wound and somewhat reduced on the nose. As it opens, ethereal layers of wild strawberry, green tea and lacings of herb and white pepper unveil to tremendous effect."
France,93,124,Pinot Noir,red,Roche de Bellene 2012 Aux Boudots Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),"Made from 60-year-old vines from a property next door to Vosne-Romanée, this wine is both structured and rich. It has dark tannins, with juicy and jammy plum fruits that are layered with acidity. It is still firm, dense and needs time. Drink from 2020."
US,92,38,Zinfandel,red,Seghesio 2009 Zinfandel (Rockpile),"The alcohol is high, giving the wine a peppery burn, but that's part of its charm. Without such ripeness, the wine wouldn't have the briary berry, sweet dried currant and leathery flavors. New oak, to the tune of 25%, adds an even richer layer of char. Quite an accomplishment. Drink with barbecue or big, hearty beef dishes."
Italy,93,130,Chardonnay,white,Ferrari 2002 Giulio Ferrari Riserva del Fondatore Chardonnay (Trento),"Italy's most iconic sparkler, this is made entirely from Chardonnay and aged on its lees for at least 10 years. Layers of flavors include yeasty sensations of baked bread, pastry cream, honey, vanilla, juicy pear and candied lemon peel. It has depth and complexity, with an ultrafine mousse that enhances the creamy texture. Drink through 2020."
US,92,40,Syrah,red,Terre Rouge 2006 Sentinel Oak Vineyard Pyramid Block Syrah (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Here's a big, juicy, imposingly rich Syrah that's so stuffed with primary fruit character, it needs time in the cellar to come around. Tasted in January, it's enormous in sweet, jammy blackberries, melted milk chocolate, licorice, cherry pie filling and all kinds of peppery spices. Better sometime in 2010, and could become quite dramatic after that."
US,90,38,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Alfred 2006 Chamisal Vineyards Califa Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"Racy and pure, this Chard shows the bright lime, lemon and kiwi flavors of Edna Valley Chards, with a sleek undergirding of steely minerals. It's crisp and dry, although smoky oak lends caramel and vanilla notes."
US,94,55,Pinot Noir,red,Sweetzer Cellars 2014 Rita's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"From a vineyard high up in the appellation, this is the strongest wine in Sweetzer's current lineup. Earthy mulberry, wild mint, sun-baked soil and dark chocolate scents show on the nose. Lively dark red fruit, bay leaf and earthy garrigue qualities arise on the hearty, spicy and lovely palate."
Italy,91,65,Red Blend,red,Castello di Bossi 2008 Corbaia Red (Toscana),"Corbaia is a delicious blend of Sangiovese (70%) and Cabernet Sauvignon that shows compact but well-etched lines of forest fruit, bramble, cranberry and sharp, savory spice. The tannins are firm, tight and need a few more years to unwind."
US,87,24,Chardonnay,white,Lawer 2011 Hooker Breakaway Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This has appealing flavors of tropical fruit, orange, peach and vanilla, with a creamy texture and an overall sense of elegance. The acidity is brisk and clean."
Italy,90,50,Sangiovese,red,Donna Olga 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,"Intense underbrush aromas, black berries and baking spices lead the nose on this wine. The dense palate offers up juicy wild cherry, black pepper and cinnamon-spice alongside solid but velvety tannins. It's well balanced and already shows depth but hold for complexity. Drink 2016–2021."
US,88,10,Red Blend,red,Original House Wine 2014 Red (America),"Mostly a blend of Merlot (30%), Syrah (25%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (24%), this wine offers appealing, downright fruity aromas of red currant and raspberry jam. The lightly sweet cranberry and cherry flavors provide a lot of easy-drinking enjoyment."
France,86,10,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Les Vignerons Réunis de Monségur 2012 Romantique  (Bordeaux),"Calling a wine romantic is perhaps a new approach for Bordeaux. The wine itself is ripe and jammy, with wood tannins that will be softer in a year. Drink from 2016."
US,84,23,Zinfandel,red,Cedar View Winery 2014 Zinfandel (Sierra Foothills),The tarry herbal aromas and roasted peppery flavors of this medium-bodied wine give it a rather lean taste profile and the texture is moderately tannic.
US,93,50,Syrah,red,Spring Valley Vineyard 2011 Nina Lee Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Coming from a cool vintage, this thriller of a wine has generous notes of black pepper, plum, orange rind and cranberry. It's concentrated, rich and flavorful with the oak (50% new French) giving some gruffness to the tannins that should soften with additional time in the bottle. Best after 2017."
US,84,7,Red Blend,red,Barefoot NV Sweet Red Red (California),"A very sweet red blend, this has easy-to-like raspberry and vanilla flavors. Give it a slight chill and drink it with ham sandwiches."
US,89,23,Chardonnay,white,Novelty Hill 2011 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Soft and lightly buttery, this offers clean fruit flavors of apple and pear. Not quite as concentrated as previous efforts, perhaps a reflection of a cooler vintage in this northern location."
US,91,35,Red Blend,red,Fazeli Cellars 2014 Uproar Red (California),"This off-the-wall blend of 55% Zinfandel, 37% Barbera and 8% Shiraz works quite well, with aromas of pressed elderberries, crushed violets and dark chocolate. The sip starts off juicy, fresh and approachable for many palates, showing cooked black plum, more tart plum skin and salt and pepper spices."
US,85,38,Pinot Noir,red,Dutton-Goldfield 2006 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The richness of this bottling seems to have been falling over the last few vintages. The '06 is very dry and tart, with modest cherry, rhubarb, cola and spice flavors that are unlikely to evolve."
US,85,15,Red Blend,red,Camaraderie NV Storm King Red Red (Washington),"This is the winery's every day generic red blend, mixing vintages, vineyards and grapes. It's forward, fruit-powered and relatively soft, finishing with astringent and herbal tannins."
Italy,91,22,Red Blend,red,Alberto Longo 2012 Red (Cacc’e Mmitte di Lucera),"Aromas suggest smoke, blue flower, mature berry and baking spice. A blend of 55% Nero di Troia, 30% Montepulciano d'Abruzzo and 15% Bombino Bianco, this has a savory, smoky palate that delivers juicy blackberry, spicy blueberry, clove and graphite alongside sleek tannins. It's delicious and already approachable."
Italy,89,32,Red Blend,red,Allegrini 2010 La Grola Red (Veronese),"Made from a blend of Corvina, Syrah and Oseleta, this savory wine is made by one of Amarone's leading producers. It offers red currant, bell pepper and black pepper flavors. It's tightly wound but fresh, and would pair nicely with grilled portobello mushrooms."
Italy,90,33,Pinot Grigio,white,Jermann 2015 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Venezia Giulia),"Aromas of white peach, flint and hint of banana carry over to the round, ripe palate along with green apple and a note of juicy tangerine. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors and leads to a bright, clean finish."
US,86,10,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Avalon 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"This has rich flavors of black currants, licorice and sandalwood, and it finishes dry and spicy. This should be relatively easy to find thanks to its 50,000-case production."
US,90,150,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Flora Springs 2013 Rutherford Hillside Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Soft and supple yet powerful on the palate, this is generously seasoned with smoky oak and meat aromas. Tobacco and clove flavors keep it savory and are complemented by black currant fruit."
US,87,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Rodney Strong 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Dry and tannic, this 100% Cab has flavors of herbs, blackberries and tea. It's a tough wine not showing generosity now. You can age for a couple years, but the tannins will outlast the fruit."
US,88,28,Sangiovese,red,Pure Cru 2009 Sangio Vetta Sangiovese (Napa Valley),"Tastes considerably fruitier and more full bodied than your typical Sangiovese, no doubt because winemaker Mitch Cosentino added Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc to the blend. The wine retains Sangiovese's acidity and sour cherry flavors, but the Bordeaux varieties bring layers of blackberries, cassis and chocolate to this dry, elegant wine."
France,92,43,Riesling,white,Sipp Mack 2014 Rosacker Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Freshly cut red, yellow and green apples make both nose and palate very fruity. The dry palate with its lemony freshness and open aspect lets all the apple flavors shine and inflects them here and there with baked and dried apple, too. Wonderfully fruity and pure."
France,88,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Feret Lambert 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur,"This is a ripe and juicy wine that has fine red fruits and some firm tannins. It is spicy, concentrated and fully fruited, with well-balanced tannins. Drink this attractive wine from 2018."
Italy,87,11,Chardonnay,white,Lagaria 2008 Chardonnay (Delle Venezie),"You can't beat the low price and overall good cheer of this fresh Italian Chardonnay in a screwtop bottle. The golden-colored wine reveals a soft and smooth texture accented by pretty aromas of stone fruit, honey and almond nut."
US,88,52,Pinot Noir,red,Woodenhead 2011 Wet Kiss Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A field of mint is found on the nose of this soft, spicy wine with the gimmicky name, around a core of red cherry and touch of oak. Fresh and bright, it has a suggestion of heft on the finish."
US,92,70,Pinot Noir,red,Lynmar 2012 Kanzler Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is the winery's first Kanzler Vineyard Pinot Noir and its only Sonoma Coast appellation Pinot. The cool-climate vineyard offers ripe cherry and plum around a core of firm, velvety tannins. From there, vibrant cranberry and rhubarb flirt with black tea, while red apple, sage and sandalwood notes round out the flavors on the long finish."
US,86,19,Pinot Gris,white,Corvallis Cellars 2013 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"Young and spicy, this easy-drinking Pinot Gris still shows some bite and some bitterness, perhaps from skin contact. Give it a little more bottle age, and drink it chilled, to bring out the tart fruit and cut the phenolics."
Italy,87,65,White Blend,white,Elena Walch 2011 Beyond the Clouds White (Alto Adige),"Oak extract dominates the nose on this wine together with aromas of Golden Delicous apple and lemon zest. The palate offers lemon, oak, vanilla and clove, but it lacks the fruit richness needed to support the oak."
Italy,88,16,Red Blend,red,Sella & Mosca 1995 Tanca Farra Red (Sardinia),"Tanca Farra is the name of the soil; the grapes are Cabernet Sauvignon (50%) and the Sardinian workhorse, Cannonau (50%). They work well together in this wine, which opens nicely to reveal black-fruit notes. The palate experience is ripe tannins, adequate acidity and a good mouthfeel. The finish is long, with cherry and plum notes."
US,92,45,Pinot Noir,red,Tessier Winery 2015 Saveria Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This is a great example of a lower alcohol, somewhat underripe Pinot Noir that shows solid depth and lovable freshness. Lively aromas of black-raspberry sorbet and dark strawberry show on the nose, while the palate picks up a tart cranberry character. White pepper, thyme and juniper enliven the fruity flavors."
US,90,55,Pinot Noir,red,Davies 2011 Nobles Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"The chilly vintage shows in the light delicacy of this Pinot Noir. It's pale in color and quite tart in the mouth, which gives the cherries, cranberries and cola a bite. There's a rich jacket of oak, while the official alcohol level is 14.2% by volume. Drink now–2016."
US,89,30,Chardonnay,white,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2010 Canoe Ridge Estate Chardonnay (Horse Heaven Hills),"Coming from a warm site in a cool vintage, it's an intriguing wine with notes of freshly cut hay, peach and mango.  It's lighter in style, with the partial malolactic fermentation (60%) providing extra weight and feel."
US,92,48,Pinot Noir,red,Arista 2009 Longbow Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A lovely, silky Pinot Noir, so fresh and vibrant in cherry, cola, pomegranate and spice flavors. Feels light and delicate in the mouth, with lots of charm, yet shows a depth that makes it complex and interesting. Now–2014."
US,87,10,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Peltier 2013 Hybrid Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"The flavors of this medium-bodied wine are hearty, with bell pepper, black pepper and green olive notes, and in this vein it's tasty and fairly concentrated. The balance is good, the palate sensation is nicely dry and the finish lingers a bit."
US,87,32,Chardonnay,white,Gary Farrell 2009 Russian River Selection Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"With brisk acidity and upfront fruit, this is ready to drink. The pineapple, pear and oak flavors are housed in a creamy mouthfeel."
US,85,28,Syrah,red,Vin du Lac 2007 Barrel Select Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Sweet, grapey, raspberry fruit is smothered in sweet spices, with flavors of spun sugar candy."
Italy,88,17,Pinot Grigio,white,Antonutti 2010 Vis Terrae Pinot Grigio (Friuli Grave),"This is a unique wine indeed. The style here is heavy, thick and shows the limits Pinot Grigio can achieve in terms of extraction and richness. The wine's appearance shows a copperish hue and the texture is thickly laced with carmel, candied fruit and apricot."
France,85,10,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château des Judes 2011  Bordeaux,"This dry, firm wine shows a hint of bitter extraction, but the core of the wine is smooth. Give it several years' aging."
US,82,15,Pinot Noir,red,Sonoma Creek 1998 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"Light in color, almost rusty. Fleshy aromas of chunky, brambly fruit also offer a lot of pepper, both black and green. With good body and texture, you’re hopeful for more in the mouth, but the fruit is marred by the essence of veggies, even tasting a bit stewed."
Italy,89,48,Sangiovese,red,Molino di Sant'Antimo 2012 Varco 84  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Blue flower, ripe plum, baking spice and pine forest scents lead the nose. The palate is still tense and tightly drawn, showing tart sour cherry, star anise and a hint of espresso through flexed, fine-grained tannins that leave a firm finish. Drink after 2020."
France,84,11,Red Blend,red,Castel Montplaisir 1997 Red (Cahors),"Another Cahors from the stable of Alain-Dominque Perrin, this one is the entry-level wine, made to be more accessible than his flagship wine from Château Lagrezette or the luxury cuvée. There's still plenty of toasty oak, but also some raspberry-cherry fruit and green tobacco on the finish."
France,85,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Patache d'Aux 2012  Médoc,"Marked by red berry fruits and soft tannins, this has a juicy character, with touches of wood aging that are already integrated. The aftertaste, with its fresh currant acidity and rounded fruit, shows that this will be ready to drink soon. Drink from 2016."
US,88,40,Pinot Noir,red,Seufert 2012 Vine Idyl Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Slightly sweet flavors of concentrated strawberry preserves create a rather thick mouthfeel. It's a jammy style of Pinot, to be sure, but with just enough supporting acidity to keep it from crumbling under its own weight. Drink over the next two or three years."
US,86,12,Chardonnay,white,Drumheller 2014 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas of vanilla, char and toast lead to light creamy stone fruit and canned-corn flavors. It provides appeal but the oak seems overweighted."
France,86,10,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château de l'Aubrade 2015  Bordeaux,"Solidly structured, this is a dense wine. Its black fruits add to the density, giving a concentrated, fruity wine. Drink this starting from mid-2018."
US,87,12,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Mirassou 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"Great price for a super-drinkable Sauvignon Blanc. Brilliantly crisp and mouthwateringly clean, it delivers bone-dry flavors of lemons, limes and grapefruits, with a wildflowery spiciness."
US,82,17,Merlot,red,Ancient Peaks 2009 Merlot (Paso Robles),"Feels hot and prickly, with simple cherry, cola and spice flavors, as well as thick, astringent tannins. And the acidity tastes unnatural."
France,83,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Larteau 2012  Bordeaux Supérieur,"Bread and yeasty aromas lead to a wine that has tannins and wood aging, leaving the fruitiness behind."
US,86,32,Pinot Noir,red,Hawkins Cellars 2013 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"The back label notes that this is the winery's reserve, sourced from Methven Family vineyards. It shows cranberry and blue-plum fruit of moderate ripeness, feeling a bit flat in the mouth. A year in 50% new French oak adds a touch of toastiness."
US,91,19,Red Blend,red,Beresan 2009 The Buzz Yellow Jacket Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"It is difficult to find a blend this good from the region in Walla Walla known as The Rocks District for less than $30. Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Malbec and Syrah are combined resulting in a deeply-flavored wine with blue and black fruits, licorice and a streak of scrumptious caramel. A super value, and just plain delicious."
US,96,72,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Sineann 2012 Champoux Vineyards Block One Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Block One is the original (1972) planting at Champoux, and it has anchored many of Washington's finest wines over the past 20 years. Few if any better are than this, a huge wine with massive flavors of dense black fruits, from berries to cherries to cassis. It's seen plenty of new oak, giving it a cedar-soaked scent, but the sheer power of the wine promises a long and expressive development over the coming decades."
Italy,87,17,Red Blend,red,Terre di Giurfo 2011 Mascaria Barricato  (Cerasuolo di Vittoria),"Aromas suggest mature berry, scorched earth, animal, toast and anise. The palate offers ripe black berry, oak, espresso, cocoa and vanilla alongside dusty tannins."
US,91,66,Pinot Noir,red,Maggy Hawk 2014 Graceful Lady Maggy Hawk Estate Vineyard Clone 777 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Concentrated fruit, spice and black-tea flavors lend a sense of depth on the palate and make this full-bodied wine satisfying to sip. Made from the estate vineyard using only Clone 777 vines, it matches black cherry and tart cherry notes to a nicely gripping texture, with a lingering finish."
US,88,48,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Artesa 2012 Limited Release Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Opaque and thick, this wine is robust, yet balanced—a study in cedar and pencil lead that drives into a dimension of dried herb. The savory components find companionship in fruitier notes of cherry and blueberry, before a tannic, oaky finish closes things out."
France,87,13,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château des Judes 2016  Bordeaux,"Still showing its wood aging, the wine is rich with spice and blackberry fruit. It is structured and with swathes of juicy fruitiness. The acidity at the end gives this wine its final lift."
France,90,25,Chardonnay,white,Vins Auvigue 2014 Solutré  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"Full of yellow fruits, this is a ripe and lightly wood-aged wine. Great acidity and plenty of rich but lively fruitiness play well together, leading into a crisp aftertaste. It needs to age a bit more, so drink from 2018."
France,86,17,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Noblet 2012  Côtes de Bourg,The young tannins are keeping the wine dry at the moment. But the flavors of black currant fruitiness and fresh acidity promise a bright and fruity future. Drink from 2016.
US,90,25,Merlot,red,Liberty Lake 2009 Merlot (Red Mountain),"The aromas of cocoa, raspberry, black tea, vanilla and cranberry are in full bloom. The cranberry and cherry flavors are ripe and full, backed by firm tannins. This wine is in a sweet spot. Drink now."
US,91,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Lauren Ashton Cellars 2012 Proprietor's Cuvée Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Made with 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Merlot, 10% Malbec and 3% Petit Verdot, this lightly colored wine offers aromas of freshly brewed coffee, cocoa and herbs. Flavors are elegant yet concentrated, with black fruit on the finish."
France,89,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Gauthier 2010  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"A packed wine, its ripe fruits are a warm pleasure. It has all the structure of the year but in fine measure, lending density and richness to the palate. It's a wine for aging; give it at least five years."
France,89,53,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château le Pape 2008 L'Excellence  (Pessac-Léognan),"Rounded and sweet wine, its tannins buried in the rich blackberry fruits. It is dominated by its fruity character, although there is a chunky texture that gives a firm mouthfeel. Ready to drink in a year."
US,87,20,Red Blend,red,Board Track Racer 2010 The Vincent Red (Washington),"Forward and fruity, this is a tight, tart wine with a jumble of berry and bramble flavors. It's peppery, spicy, but don't look for too much complexity. Gulp it down for the enjoyable quaffer that it's meant to be."
Italy,87,13,White Blend,white,Tenuta Le Velette 2012 Lunato  (Orvieto Classico Superiore),"This Grechetto-based wine opens with a pretty floral fragrance that recalls yellow- and white-spring flowers. The palate offers juicy peach, tropical fruit and citrus flavors, with a hint of thyme. Thanks to crisp acidity, it has a clean, refreshing finish."
US,88,19,Pinot Gris,white,Arbor Brook 2012 Croft Vineyard Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Tart and puckery, this is for acid-lovers. The aromas carry accents of pine needles, while the fruit is headlined with grapefruit and tangy citrus. Very refreshing."
US,85,12,Red Blend,red,Sheldrake Point 2012 Luckystone Red (Finger Lakes),"Toast and herb mingle with lavish lilac and lavender perfume on this unique red blend (made predominantly from Cabernet Franc). Brisk berry and cherry flavors are expansive and bold on the palate, and fringed with savory herb tones on the finish."
France,89,29,Chardonnay,white,Cave des Grands Crus Blancs 2013  Pouilly-Fuissé,"Mineral and young, this tight, nervy wine needs to develop. Apple and pear flavors are ripe while also bringing out attractive acidity. The texture is still firm and steely, needing time. Drink from 2016."
US,91,26,Pinot Gris,white,Carabella 2014 Reserve Pinot Gris (Chehalem Mountains),"This is the first reserve Pinot Gris from the winery—half fermented in stainless, half in barrel. The wine feels as if it's very lightly oxidized, with dusty, tawny apple flavors that recall a good hard cider. Its power is in the persistent, bone dry finish, that never quits. Drink now through 2018."
US,91,70,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Apsara 2013 Kenefick Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Now winemaker for Swanson, Robin Ackhurst excels here in this tiny production of his own wine, which exhibits exotic plum and juicy blackberry. A 100% varietal offering, it has a girth of structured tannin and toasty oak."
US,90,28,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Brander 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon,"Fresh-pressed boysenberry scents meet lava rock and slate minerality on the nose of this appellation blend from Fred Brander. There's a flinty earthiness to the palate, with pressed plum flavors and a strong graphite streak. It's relatively light in body, making it a perfect food wine."
US,93,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Tamarack Cellars 2009 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Reserve Red (Red Mountain),"Richly aromatic, on the strength of the nose alone this could pass for something from Napa's Rutherford Bench. The blue and purple fruit notes and dusty tannins all say California, but the laser-like definition, minerality and natural acidity prove it's Washington fruit all the way. Strikingly dense and complex, with decades of life ahead."
France,84,25,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Régis Jouan 2014  Sancerre,"This wine is closed, tight and possibly still developing, with some acidity and hints of citrus flavors. There's also a cheesy character that is less attractive."
US,87,26,Chardonnay,white,Schug 2006 Chardonnay (Carneros),"Shows the crisp acidity that usually marks Carneros Chards, and also an earthy, freshly picked herb quality to the jammy peach, pineapple and green apple flavors. Consider it a food-worthy Chardonnay. Drink now."
US,90,20,Syrah,red,Belharra 2015 Rosé of Syrah (Carneros),"While a minuscule amount of this was made, it bears remembering the producer for this is an impressive burst of tangy citrus, lemon and orange. Light and bright, it has a pithy texture of cranberry and raspberry."
US,89,32,Chardonnay,white,Clif Family 2013 Chardonnay (Oak Knoll District),"Nicely textured and balanced, this white from a cooler subsection of the larger Napa Valley is more austere than not, a taste of lemon and licorice combining in a medium-bodied package of refreshment. The mouthfeel works consistently from start to finish, the end note smooth and swift."
US,92,55,Pinot Noir,red,Gary Farrell 2010 Hallberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The vineyard is near Sebastopol and the Green Valley, and the wine shows its cool-climate origins in the brisk terroir that gives the raspberry, sweet red cherry and persimmon fruit such bite. It's enormously attractive to drink now for sheer lusciousness, but has the integrity to age for 10–15 years, perhaps longer, depending on your taste for older Pinot."
US,90,16,Chardonnay,white,Sextant 2015 Chardonnay (Central Coast),"It's hard to find Chardonnays priced at less than $20 that pack this much interest. This bottling offers fresh-squeezed underripe tangerine, lemon blossoms, lemon curd, crisp Gala apple, sharp grapefruit skin and a bit of butter on the nose. A salty lemon butter and marmalade flavor show on the palate, along with pear, apple and nectarine, framed by intense acidity."
US,91,46,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Zaca Mesa 2012 Z Three Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"Sanguine, leathery aromas show on the nose of this blend of 55% Syrah, 40% Mourvèdre and 5% Grenache, accented with dried elderberry, wild thyme, black plum and peppery spice. Woody flavors of bay leaf, black sage and rosemary show on the medium-bodied palate, with sour plum notes lifted by black pepper on the finish."
US,87,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Herzog 2009 Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"Very soft, this has a melted quality to the blackberry, cherry liqueur and cedar flavors. Everything about it is so fine, though it could have a firmer structure. Still, it's an elaborate wine that will pair well with beef or lamb. Drink now."
US,86,28,Merlot,red,Almquist 2009 Chandler Reach Vineyard Merlot (Yakima Valley),"Vineyard designated Merlot is a rarity in the state, though this is one of the three the winery made in this vintage. Amped volatile aromas and generous barrel spices are followed by light, slightly dried-out cranberry and cherry flavors."
US,90,26,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Black Stallion 2014 Limited Release Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"With a handful of Sémillon in the blend, this is a fleshy, full-bodied style of white wine, offering darker tones of caramel and oak. Well made, it features a tangle of vanilla and butterscotch on the big finish."
France,87,50,Pinot Noir,red,L. Tramier & Fils 2009 Premier Cru  (Beaune),"This is ripe and jammy, with soft fruit and attractive acidity. It is warm, with a hint of wood aging. Ready to drink."
US,92,43,Pinot Noir,red,Phillips Hill 2014 Roma's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Delicate in flavor and firm in texture, this wine is savory and complex, with a slightly lean but very appetizing mouthfeel. Cranberry and black tea aromas are followed by tangy red cherry and cinnamon spice flavors supported by a light layer of fine-grained tannins."
US,93,48,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Rôtie Cellars 2014 Southern Blend Red (Washington),"Grenache (70%) takes the lead on this blend followed by Mourvèdre (25%) and Syrah. The aromas draw you into the glass with notes of high-toned lightly green herbs, rose hips and raspberries. The ripe red-fruit flavors display a dazzling sense of purity, drinking like a bowl of fresh fruit, with a sprinkling of herbs and spices mixed in. The balance and texture are impressive."
US,92,50,Red Blend,red,Parrish Family 2013 Silken Reserve Red (Paso Robles),"A brilliantly complex but rarely done blend, this mix of 58% Cabernet Sauvignon and 42% Petite Sirah shows blueberry donuts, vanilla ice cream, licorice, stewed strawberries and the lightest touch of dill and herbal aromatics on the nose. Gravel, asphalt and elderberry come through on the sip, elevated by white and black pepper. It's still a tad wound up."
France,88,20,Pinot Gris,white,Wolfberger NV Brut Pinot Gris (Crémant d'Alsace),"Pinot Gris makes a Crémant that is not quite dry, with spicy intensity and delicious acidity. It's rich, with almond and buttery flavors that are followed by a crisp, fragrant aftertaste."
Italy,86,45,Red Blend,red,Trabucchi d'Illasi 2007 Terra del Cereolo  (Valpolicella Superiore),"This is still surprisingly fresh considering the age of this wine. It's simple and enjoyable, with mouthwatering cherry flavors layered with mint and white pepper accents. Pair it with rich pasta dishes."
US,87,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Matanzas Creek 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"Fermented in both stainless steel and neutral French oak, this is a lightly bodied and balanced white with accents of grassy pea shoot, lemongrass and pineapple. Pithy and lushly layered, it finishes in a rich fistful of wild vanilla."
Italy,89,50,Sangiovese,red,Castello di Monsanto 2006 Fabrizio Bianchi Sangiovese (Rosso di Toscana),"Made entirely with Sangiovese, it has aromas of ripe black fruit, tilled earth, toasted oak sweet vanilla and a hint of leather. The rich palate offers toasted oak, black berries, espresso and coffee alongside dusty, drying tannins"
US,87,17,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Ross Andrew 2010 The Huntsman Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"With 22% Merlot blended, it's direct and appealing with notes of black tea, cherry, leafy greens and bittersweet chocolate. The palate is on the lighter side of medium bodied with a pleasing sense of balance and a slightly gritty feel to the tannins."
France,95,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Pichon Longueville 2011  Pauillac,"This is a solid, concentrated wine from a reliable chateau. It has weight and power, with rich black fruits balanced with fresh acidity. Touches of bitter extraction and wood aging are likely to integrate as the wine ages. It should develop into an impressive and powerful wine. Drink from 2018."
France,93,46,Riesling,white,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2014 Hengst Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Slightly funky notions appear first: There's a hint of reduction but this, thankfully, blows off. Underneath sits a very sprightly, very fresh wine that pits fruity apple mellowness against total, dry freshness. This has a concentrated core, the aromas are still a little tinged by the flinty, smoky hints of reduction but this will stand them in good stead for cellar age. Give this some time. Drink 2020–2030."
France,91,42,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Les Vignerons de la Méditerranée 2005 Cuvée Mythique Limited Release Red (Corbières),"A rich and beautiful wine with a lush, full weight and velvety texture. Typical black fruit abounds with accents of milk chocolate, thyme and eucalyptus. A hint of grapefruit oil adds vibrancy to the nose, transcending a more traditional Corbières offering. The finish is long and lingering but a bit tight with strong tannic presence; drink 2010 on. Only 50 cases imported."
US,94,50,Chardonnay,white,Williams Selyem 2009 Allen Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A gigantic Chardonnay. What it lacks in subtlety it more than makes up for in sheer power. Dazzles with pineapple jam, mango, pear, lime, buttered toast and sweet oak flavors, balanced with fine acidity. There's a minerally stoniness that makes it even more complex. Drink now–2014."
France,90,27,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Roc de Boissac 2014  Puisseguin Saint-Émilion,"Toast and blackberry aromas set the scene for this ripe, bold, fruity wine. With tannins, spice from wood-aging and a still-firm texture, it's showing its youth, but the rich blackberry fruit and density promise long life ahead. Drink from 2020."
US,91,60,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Sodaro 2012 Felicity Red (Coombsville),"With 80% of the blend comprised of Cabernet Sauvignon, supported by every other major red Bordeaux variety, this wine offers dusty tannins around soft, integrated oak, sharp black fruit and dried herb. Robust and ripe on the finish, it should mellow in the cellar, through 2022."
US,87,24,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Rancho Sisquoc 2009 Flood Family Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County),"So sweet in fruit, it's almost like a dessert pastry. Shows blackberry, cherry and cocoa flavors, with pie spices and caramelized oak. Finishes a little sweet, but it's clean and made in a popular style."
US,91,16,Red Blend,red,Sineann 2015 Red (Oregon),"This superb value mixes barrels from all the red wines in Sineann's portfolio. Predominantly Pinot Noir, Merlot and Zinfandel, there are small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot as well. It's dark and spicy, the flavors well integrated. It adds up to a potent and powerful all-purpose barbeque red, loaded with black fruits and finished with a kiss of caramel."
Italy,86,15,White Blend,white,Maurigi 2009 Bacca Bianca Tenuta di Budonetto White (Sicilia),"Bacca Bianca from the vineyards of Tenuta di Budonetto, is a blend of Inzolia, Grecanico and Chardonnay. This wine is slightly muddled aromatically, but it does possess a fresh, zesty mouthfeel."
US,93,62,Syrah,red,Caliza 2013 Syrah (Paso Robles Willow Creek District),"Dark in the glass, this wine by Carl Bowker offers fragrant vanilla, baked blueberry, a touch of pepper and coffee-cocoa foam on the rich and inviting nose. Hearty blueberry and blackberry fruit flavors are lifted by baking spice, bound to a tart, tannic, black-plum-skin-like structure."
France,92,33,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Pontac Monplaisir 2014  Pessac-Léognan,"Named after the Pontac family which in the 18th century owned large swathes of Bordeaux and its vineyards, this estate is based around a former hunting lodge. The wine is ripe and full, finely structured and with tight still-young acidity. Drink from 2022."
Italy,87,30,Chardonnay,white,Montenisa 2006 Satèn Chardonnay (Franciacorta),"This sparkling wine made from Chardonnay, opens with a yeasty fragrance of bread crust and pastry. The palate shows citrus and vanilla flavors, hints of oak and vigorous bubbles."
US,84,23,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Truett Hurst 2012 California Square Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"This fruity, one-dimensional wine has flavors of blackberries, brown sugar and caramelized oak. The tannins are nice and thick, suggesting grilled meats for pairings."
US,88,30,Syrah,red,Garretson 1999 The Corcairghorm - Fralich Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles),"From a warm Eastside vineyard, this wine has pretty aromas of plums, pepper, white chocolate and smoke; well-knit and pure. Big in terms of fruit, but well balanced and elegant. The acids and tannins are soft and user-friendly."
US,87,20,Chardonnay,white,Inception 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"A dense vanilla-bean character coats a nose of seared white peach and toasted nuts. The palate features thick, ripe fruits, preserved lemon, a touch of walnut and a rocky grip."
US,84,10,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Sagelands 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Hailing from the cool 2010 vintage, the notes of coffee, olive and cherry here are light and sweet, backed by dry, chalky tannins."
France,85,10,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Despagne 2011 Eclat  (Bordeaux Blanc),"In this lightly fruity wine, apples and citrus flavors come with a bright, crisp character. Ready to drink. Screwcap."
US,92,58,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Monticello Vineyards 2004 Tietjen Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The Rutherford vineyard has been the source of well-regarded Cabs for Monticello and the '04 is the latest. Compact and ageworthy, it shows well-ripened blackberry, cherry and cola flavors that have been generously oaked. The tannins are firm and sticky now, suggesting development. Best 2008–2012."
US,90,20,Chardonnay,white,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2013 Mimi Chardonnay (Horse Heaven Hills),"The aromas on this wine are light and nuanced with notes of pear, butter and pineapple. It's full bodied in feel, clean in style showing good weight and viscosity while retaining a pleasing sense of lightness."
Italy,87,26,Red Blend,red,Guicciardini Strozzi 2014 Campo al Capriolo  (Bolgheri),"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Syrah, this opens with delicate aromas suggesting black-skinned fruit and a whiff of cooking spice. The easygoing palate delivers black currant and leather alongside round tannins."
US,86,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Vogelzang 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"Give this tough, young Cabernet a good long decant before serving. At first, it's dominated by sharp acidity and mouth-numbing tannins. But after some airing, it offers black currant flavors. This is likely not an ager."
US,87,45,Pinot Noir,red,Sonnet 2006 Amber Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A lighter-style Pinot, in both mouthfeel and flavor. Silky and gentle in the mouth, it has pleasant flavors of cherry and raspberry pie filling, sprinkled with anise, cinnamon, ground cloves, pepper, orange zest and vanilla."
US,87,13,Pinot Noir,red,Bridlewood 2015 Pinot Noir (California),"Black pepper and rosemary aromas join forces with black cherry and blackberry flavors in this well-balanced, moderately tannic wine. It has a refreshing quality, tasty fruit and medium body, all of which will make it versatle with food."
Italy,88,25,Red Blend,red,Cottanera 2011 Fatagione Red (Sicilia),"A blend of 85% Nerello Mascalese and 15% international varieties, this opens with aromas of toasted oak, mocha, vanilla and grilled bell pepper. The aromas carry through to the palate, along with cassis, cedar and graphite."
US,85,13,Red Blend,red,Cameron Hughes 2009 Lot 348 Field Blend Red (California),"A robust, rustic red wine for drinking now with stews, burgers, vegetarian rice and bean dishes in red sauce. The winery doesn't tell us the varietal blend, but it's ripened to the limits of raisins, and high in alcohol, with a resulting glyceriny sweetness."
France,81,16,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Tire Pé 2009  Bordeaux,"Meat and bacon aromas introduce a wine that is taut, structured and high on the acidity. It has a lean, slightly dirty taste, which is not attractive."
US,91,35,Merlot,red,DaMa 2012 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This wine is a rarity for Washington in a number of ways. It's 100% varietal, comes from Golden Ridge Vineyard, and saw just 20% new French oak. It offers appealing, luscious raspberry compote and herb aromas and flavors backed by lightly grainy tannins."
US,92,49,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Black Ridge 2009 San Andreas Red Red (Santa Cruz Mountains),"What a pretty wine! Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, it's delicious and complex, with each of the grape varieties bringing something different. The blackberry, cherry, currant and cedar flavors are wrapped into silky tannins. Should age for 5–6 years, but there's no reason you can't drink it now."
France,85,13,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château du Claouset 2016  Bordeaux Blanc,"With a yeasty aroma, this Vignobles Siozard wine is ripe with hints of yellow fruits as well as a smooth texture. It is soft, with just a final tang of acidity."
US,88,18,Chardonnay,white,Kunde 2014 Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"Tropical and fleshy with upfront acidity, this wine has a full-bodied richness on the nose and overtone, despite a more light-bodied midpalate and finish. Along the way, lemony brightness mingles with a taste of yellow apple."
US,94,75,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Young Inglewood 2012 Right Bank Blend Red (St. Helena),"Dominated by 60% Cabernet Franc, with 37% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot, this is a demonstration of elegance married with ripeness, offering rich, round, luxurious plum flavors alongside savory teases of clove, cigar and leather. Lengthy and smooth on the palate, it's a wine for the table, with length and breadth developing in the glass as it goes."
US,93,50,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Divio 2014 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Divio, notes winemaker Bruno Corneaux, is the ancient Roman name for Dijon, hence, a sly reference to the clones in this outstanding Chardonnay. It's lush and flavorful, with a juicy mix of pear, peach and papaya fruit. Aged 15 months in 50% new French oak, the fruit sets up against a palate-popping wash of toasted hazelnuts, filling out the extended finish. An all-around splendid bottle."
US,84,10,Riesling,white,Rock View 2013 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This aromatic wine suggests candied red apple, jasmine and ale. It's medium sweet with a lightly spritzy feel and ale notes throughout."
US,89,30,Red Blend,red,McKinney 2012 Napoleon's Secret Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"Napoleon's secret was that he liked Syrah in his Bordeaux blends, so this mix of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Syrah, 13% Cabernet Franc, 12% Merlot, 4% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot shows why, offering fresh and vibrant aromas of blueberry and licorice candy. Bright blackberry preserves pop on the palate as does fudge in this easy-drinking wine."
France,86,14,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Maison Malet Roquefort 2013 Léo de la Gaffelière  (Bordeaux Blanc),"This is tight, crisp and herbaceous, dominated by Sauvignon Blanc. A mineral character gives a firm texture. It needs to age a few months, so drink from 2015."
US,92,45,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Serene 2014 Yamhill Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Aromatic and lushly scented with rhubarb, strawberry, cola, root beer and cocoa powder, this is immediately accessible, and yet structured to age if you can keep your hands off of it. Streaks of beet root sneak in around raspberry and cherry fruit, with firm tannins and highlights of toast, coffee, caramel and dark chocolate. This is a very fine cuvée that seems to gain focus as it rolls through the finish."
France,89,58,Chardonnay,white,Jaffelin 2010  Puligny-Montrachet,"This wine has a fine definition of minerality that's combined with tense structure. There is a hint of wood, a flavor of fresh-peeled apple and a taut, steely edge. Layers of acids mark the finish."
US,85,15,Chardonnay,white,Benmarl 2014 Stainless Steal Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Hints of freshly pressed apple and pear are shaded in savory tones of dust and bramble in this full-bodied Chardonnay. Sunny lemon acidity brightens the midpalate but the finish extends on a slightly bitter note.
France,85,16,Sauvignon Blanc,white,François Lurton 2013 Les Fumées Blanches Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France),"A fresh, herbaceous Sauvignon Blanc, mainly from the French south-west. It has a lively, crisp, totally fruity character with grapefruit, gooseberry and a more tropical fruit hint. Drink now."
US,92,58,Red Blend,red,Fazeli Cellars 2012 Hafez Red (Temecula Valley),"Baked blueberries, peppery allspice, wet gravel and a touch of vanilla show on this nose of this blend of 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 70% Shiraz, a spelling of Syrah used to reflect the owner's Persian heritage. Those elements are very well integrated on the palate, where a cedar-laced frame presents lots of dark red fruit and crushed spice."
US,92,140,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Turnbull 2013 Black Label Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"An estate-grown wine from an Oakville-based producer, this is an opaque, concentrated expression of black fig and gunpowder, girded by sturdy tannin and a richness of black cherry and berry. It reveals the power of the appellation well, and a ripeness of the vintage."
France,82,13,Pinot Noir,red,Pierre Moulin NV Pinot Noir (Vin de France),"An assertive medicinal character dominates the bouquet of this wine, with secondary notes of overripe red berries and strawberry. A fruit leather and Jolly Rancher-like quality overwhelms the palate, while the finish is surprisingly sharp and short."
US,93,55,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Gamache 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"For the first time this reserve-level Gamache Cabernet includes grapes from the Ciel du Cheval vineyard as well as both the Champoux and estate vineyards. It's 100% varietal, drawing upon equal portions of fruit from all three, and it's a magnificent combination. Powerful, sleek, dense and textural, the wine explodes from the glass, muscular and thick with black fruits and ripe tannins. Highlights of black tea, espresso and smoke add layers of interest to a lengthy finish."
Italy,89,26,Red Blend,red,Monte del Frà 2011 Tenuta Lena di Mezzo  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),"This is a structured but elegant wine, with attractive aromas of baked plum, black cherry and cinnamon. The palate is both concentrated and smooth, with lush blackberry, white pepper and cinnamon flavors, as well as fresh acidity. This is delicious and ready to enjoy now."
US,86,19,White Blend,white,Murrieta's Well 2010 The Whip White Wine White (Livermore Valley),"Murrieta's blend of 31% Sauvignon Blanc, 27% Viognier, 15% Sémillon, 11% Pinot Blanc, 8% Orange Muscat and 8% Muscat Canellii is well-made and likable, medium-thick and somewhat sweet in style with citrus and almond accents. Delightfully quaffable."
US,87,23,Pinot Noir,red,Highland Springs 2009 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A whiff of smoke on entry, then it turns tannic and tight, with thin cranberry fruit driving vertically through the midpalate and on into the finish. Good persistence, though as it fades it turns a little sour."
US,91,26,Chardonnay,white,Morgan 2006 Highland Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Those familiar with Morgan's more expensive Chardonnays, such as the Double L (which comprises 55% of this blend) will find true value in this regional wine. It shows similar power and authority in a showy, Chablis-style wine whose acidic, minerally structure frames intense citrus and oak flavors."
France,85,15,White Blend,white,Wolfberger 2011 Edelzwicker White (Alsace),"Just off dry, this is a smooth, attractively fruity wine that has a light touch of perfume. The acidity keeps the freshness level up, producing a wine that's easy to drink now. Screwcap."
Italy,93,250,Sangiovese,red,Isole e Olena 2010 Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),"Underbrush, French oak, Mediterranean herb, menthol and blackberry aromas unfold on this elegantly structured red. The full-bodied palate offers ripe black cherry, cinnamon, star anise and chopped mint alongside fine-grained tannins. This is still young and needs to develop to its full potential. Drink 2018–2028."
France,86,10,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Maison Noble 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur,"Still toasty, this is a fruity, spicy wine. Firm tannins form the backdrop to the red berry fruits and fresh acidity. It will develop attractively over the next few years, so drink from 2017."
US,93,42,Pinot Noir,red,Lost Canyon 2008 Morelli Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A beautiful Pinot Noir, although it's a bit brusque in acidity. Still, it's enormously rich and dry, with long-lasting flavors of raspberry tart and cherry-cinnamon granola. Give it a brief decant, and drink with rich, umami-inspired fare, like teriaki salmon or cured meats."
US,85,22,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Aquinas 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa County-Sonoma County-Lake County),"This red sources from across three appellations and four varieties, all aged in a mix of French and American oak for one year. That oak imparts a smoky element around thick, concentrated baked fruit and big, lasting tannin weight, showing plenty of leathery tobacco."
US,91,23,Red Blend,red,Cavatappi 2012 San Pietro Tuscan Style Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of Sangiovese (38%), Merlot (31%) and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine displays each in turn with aromas and flavors of dried herbs, coffee, tobacco and cherry. The style is reserved, with plenty of fruit and acid but subtle oak—perfect for the dinner table."
US,93,55,Chardonnay,white,Small Vines 2014 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Light, bright and citrusy, this lovely wine is integrated in terms of oak and ripeness, letting its crispness of lemon and tangerine speak loudest. A complex, structured wine, it becomes more interesting as it opens, allowing room for specks of stone and nutmeg to peek through."
US,87,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Arbios 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"A 100% varietal wine, this is both soft and dense, herbal and restrained in cranberry and red currant. Dry and dusty, the body is medium to full bodied, and the finish medium-long. Enjoy now."
US,87,24,Merlot,red,Illustrious 2011 Merlot (Carneros),"Carneros brings its cool touch to this Merlot in the form of zesty acidity and a body as light and silky as Pinot Noir. The flavors, of ripe red raspberries sprinkled with cinnamon, anise and brown sugar, are elaborate and focused."
US,87,40,Pinot Noir,red,Adastra 2008 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Here's a nice, rich Pinot Noir for drinking now. It's fairly soft and sweet, showing raspberry and cherry cream, vanilla, toasty oak and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened with acidity."
US,88,50,Pinot Noir,red,Weather 2012 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Earthy mushroom and forest floor rise from the opening bouquet of this reserve-level wine that expresses itself in dense, full-bodied layers of dark, bittersweet cherry. Concentrated and robust, it finishes savory and mouthwateringly fleshy."
France,85,27,Chardonnay,white,Domaine L. Chatelain 2012  Chablis,"Lightly smoky, this is an attractive, simple and fruity Chablis. It has apple and pear flavors balanced with soft acidity. Smooth and round, it's a wine for medium-term aging, so drink now–2018."
US,85,14,Chardonnay,white,Lucas Vineyards 2010 Dry Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Scents of sweet-cream butter, vanilla and stonefruit are enticing on the nose of this richly textured, medium-bodied wine. The palate boasts hints of sweet lemon curd and fresh apple, but the slightly-sour oak notes can be overwhelming."
France,84,30,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Paquet et Fils 2013 Château de Chaintré  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"Crisp and light, this is a bright wine with attractive acidity and fresh fruitiness. It's not a wine for the long-term, with its simple caramel and spice flavors. Drink now."
US,92,100,Pinot Noir,red,Penner-Ash 2013 Pas de Nom Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Pas de Nom, meaning “no name” in French, is intended as a self-effacing moniker for the winery's top cuvée. A barrel-selection, it's front-loaded with big cherry-pie fruit flavors. The mouthfeel is light and buttery, with a pleasing lick of caramel, while the tannins have some muscle and a hint of stem. This young, powerful wine should drink best 2018–2025."
US,88,20,Zinfandel,red,Scott Harvey 2013 InZinerator Zinfandel (California),"Velvety smooth, and brimming with ripe berry flavors, this wine feels broad and rich on the palate, carrying flavors like black plums and boysenberry jam. So ripe it's almost sweet, the wine is nothing if not generous and fruity. A 7% addition of Port-style sweet wine gives it that extra dimension."
US,87,21,Pinot Gris,white,Philo Ridge 2010 Marguerite Vineyard Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley),"A cool-climate Pinot Gris, this is a finely tuned citrusy white, with crisp notes of peach and apricot. This is the winery's first release that's made from Marguerite Vineyard fruit. It spent no time in oak and malolactic fermentation was blocked, which helped to preserve an impressive amount of acidity."
US,92,25,Chardonnay,white,Kendall-Jackson 2009 Jackson Hills Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"Very fine Chardonnay, marked by brisk, racy acidity and a steely tang to the lemon, lime, white peach and honeysuckle flavors. Very complex and lively, an alluring wine that will take a few years in the bottle."
US,85,65,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,V. Sattui 2008 Paradiso Red (Napa Valley),"Very rich and fruity, yet it tastes pretty sweet. If you enjoy a candied blackberry flavor, this could be for you."
US,89,16,Zinfandel,red,Mazzocco 1997 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"There's some old-vine juice included in the blend, and it shows. The nose is lushly scented with plums, raisins, pie cherries and ripe red fruits, with some of that distinctive new mown hay quality that old vines send up. A little barnyard aroma too, in a good way. Very extracted and intense."
France,88,16,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Tour de Mirambeau 2011  Bordeaux,"Bright and fruity, this wine has fine acidity, which balances the firm tannins. The whole wine feels juicy, packed with forward fruit and having a lively character. Drink now."
France,86,24,Chardonnay,white,Simonnet-Febvre 2015  Chablis,"From the warm 2015 vintage, this is a soft and fruity wine. It's open with broad white fruit flavors, the acidity lighter than usual for Chablis, giving it a particularly ripe character. Drink now."
US,90,35,Chardonnay,white,B.R. Cohn 2011 Sangiacomo Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),"A barrel-fermented Chardonnay with creamy texture, this opens with bright, prominent Meyer lemon notes before delving into softer flavors of pear and vanilla on the midpalate. The acidity holds through to the finish, accented by a touch of honey."
US,90,53,Syrah,red,Dusted Valley 2012 Rachis Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This 100% varietal comes from StoneTree and Red Heaven vineyards. Fruit-forward, it suggests blueberry pie with barrel notes of pencil lead and vanilla. It's full bodied and supple in feel with abundant blue-fruit flavors and smoked-meat accents on the warm, lingering finish."
US,91,95,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,William Hill Estate 2013 Benchmark Red (Napa Valley),"This is a thick, dense and juicy Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, rich in currant, black cherry and blackberry. An approachable tannin structure allows for drinkability in its youth."
US,92,55,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Januik 2010 Champoux Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, sourced from one of Washington's most iconic vineyards, is aromatically appealing with barrel notes of toast, chocolate, and spice alongside earth and dark cherry. It's wound up at present with tart acids and tightly coiled tannins, showing impeccable restraint and elegance."
US,89,32,Merlot,red,Stevens 2014 StevensMerlot Merlot (Yakima Valley),"The aromas are bright, with notes of fresh herb, red cherry, Red Vines, orange peel and barrel spice. The palate shows a pleasing sense of concentration and richness, with light meaty notes on the finish."
US,91,50,Pinot Noir,red,Broadley 2014 Shea Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The Shea cuvée has more stuffing than the other Broadley Pinots, with clean strawberry-cherry flavors. There's a streak of caramel running through the middle, and overall it's a well-balanced, forward and flavorful wine that will drink nicely now through the early 2020s."
US,88,39,Pinot Noir,red,Clouds Rest 2008 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Give this wine credit for the sheer power of its fruit. Swamps the palate with freshly crushed raspberry and cherry flavors, liberally enriched with sweet vanilla and caramelized oak. Other than that, it's a bit soft and one-dimensional, but the score reflects how delicious it is."
France,83,13,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Vieux Manoir 2015  Bordeaux,"This is a dry wine, more about structure than fruit. The tannins and the firm extraction shows strongly. It is not enjoyable."
US,86,15,Riesling,white,Castel Grisch 2013 Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Fresh and breezy, brimming with zesty lemons and apple blossoms, this light-bodied Riesling is refreshing and tart. Just a touch off dry, it's straightforward in style and thirst-quenchingly enjoyable."
US,86,44,Chardonnay,white,Freeman 2006 Ryo-fu Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Oak dominates this Chard. It's an example of the old criticism, drinking toothpicks. The flavors of buttered toast, caramel, roasted meringue and crème brûlée dominate the pineapple and pear fruit, unbalancing an otherwise excellent wine."
US,91,35,Merlot,red,L'Ecole No. 41 2011 Estate Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Previously from all Seven Hills vineyard grapes, this estate bottling now sources almost half its grapes from the high-altitude, mineral-driven Ferguson vineyard. Peppery spices elevate the nose, leading into a young, tight wine with compact cranberry and strawberry fruit. The depth and minerality are exceptional."
US,86,50,Red Blend,red,Ravenswood 2012 Pickberry Single Vineyard Red (Sonoma Mountain),"A mix of 48% Merlot, 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc and 4% Petit Verdot, all from Pickberry Vineyard, this wine is surprisingly light bodied and lean, despite a big presence of tobacco and grippy leather. The fruit is elusive, finishing with a flurry of cedar and clove."
US,93,85,Pinot Noir,red,Owen Roe 2014 Merriman Vineyard Clandeboye Pinot Noir,"Though not designated as such, this is a reserve-level effort, as noted by the special label (with Owen Roe in large, old-fashioned cursive lettering) and its overall concentration. Dense black fruits are strongly accented with flavors of espresso and baking spices. It's a powerful wine that is already drinking well, and should continue to do so into the late 2020s."
US,86,45,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Wyncroft 2012 Shou Red (Lake Michigan Shore),"Hailing from a single vineyard in Michigan's southern AVA, this is a Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend (77%), with Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petite Verdot making up the difference. This has cooked-down bramble berry aromas on the nose, and also brings to mind twings and stems. The medium-bodied palate shows a bit more character, with juicy black berry and red currant flavors elevated over green peppercorn and medium-grained tannins."
US,89,32,Red Blend,red,Foundry 2012 Proprietary Red (California),"This deep-colored, rich-tasting and thick-textured blend does a fine imitation of a more expensive red. Made with a majority of Merlot, its dark cherry and dark chocolate flavors blend well in a texture of fine-grained tannins and firm acidity."
France,89,80,Chardonnay,white,Louis Latour 2011  Puligny-Montrachet,This attractive village wine has ripe fruits as well as a more steely texture. Wood flavors give smoothness that rounds out the wine and enhances the yellow fruit flavors. Drink now.
US,88,23,Pinot Gris,white,Babcock 2009 Naughty Little Hillsides Pinot Gris (Sta. Rita Hills),"A secret of Santa Rita Hills is how kind the terroir is to Pinot Grigio AKA Pinot Gris. Babcock expresses its crisply acidic, long hangtime varietal flavors in an unoaked way, with splendid citrus and tropical fruit flavors, girded by a steely minerality. The wine, by the way, is dry, although it has a honeyed richness."
Italy,86,25,Chardonnay,white,Luretta NV Principessa Brut Chardonnay (Vino Spumante),"Aromas of green apple, dill, bread crust and almond continue on to the palate along with a hint of thyme. It has medium-sized, persistent bubbles that carry through to the off-dry finish."
US,84,36,Merlot,red,Parsonage Village 2005 Estate Merlot (Carmel Valley),"There's a burnt taste to this wine that could be a result of sun-burnt fruit or overly-charred, obviously toasted oak, or both. At any rate, although the black currant and mocha flavors are pleasant, the wine feels harsh in the mouth."
Italy,93,55,Red Blend,red,Le Pianelle 2011  Bramaterra,"You'll find scents of red berry, chopped herb, clove and a balsamic note on this fragrant Nebbiolo, Vespolina and Croatina blend. The luminous palate delivers ripe cherry, juicy strawberry, white pepper, and menthol underscored by a mineral vein. It's elegant and intense but still austere at this stage, with a firm tannic backbone. Drink 2018–2031."
US,85,11,Riesling,white,Knapp 2002 Dry Riesling (Cayuga Lake),"Light in weight, but quite tart and zesty in the mouth, this wine's green apple and lime flavors deliver a touch of sweetness despite the ""dry"" moniker."
France,88,24,Pinot Gris,white,Gustave Lorentz 2010 Réserve Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Soft and attractively spicy, this has flavors of fresh apple, exotic mango and kiwi. Along with this fruitiness is a perfumed character that rounds out the finish. Screwcap."
US,95,110,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Carneros 2010 Le Rêve Estate Grown Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (Carneros),"This gorgeous wine is floral and doughy, made entirely from Chardonnay and given time to mellow and mature over many years. The patience is rewarded in intensely complex layers of apple, pear and lemon—a caramelized backdrop providing appropriate richness and accents of gingerbread and doughy brioche."
France,86,30,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Bernard Magrez 2004 Château Tour Blanche  (Médoc),"A firm, rather lean, stalky wine, dominated by black currant flavors. The tannins are dry, dense. This will show best with food, its firmness and tannic character cutting well with rich meat."
US,87,28,Sangiovese,red,Merry Cellars 2011 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Soft and fruity, as is the style throughout the Merry Cellars lineup of reds, this includes 18% Syrah and 6% Cabernet Franc in the blend. Strawberry preserves and a coating of milk chocolate work through a quick, smooth finish."
US,95,115,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Viader 2009 Red (Napa Valley),"Made from 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Cabernet Franc, it has every hallmark of a young Napa Valley Bordeaux blend. It's dry, smooth and complex in tannins, with balancing acidity and an incredible array of flavors, including blackberry, black currant, cherry, chocolate, dried herb, smoky oak and spice. It has that important but hard-to-define quality of sophistication. It's delicious now, and it should develop in the bottle for at least 10 years."
France,88,54,Chardonnay,white,Louis Latour 2000 Goutte d'Or Premier Cru  (Meursault),"California comes to Burgundy in this wine, which features aromas of toast, caramel and butterscotch and flavors of buttered baked apples. Lush and obvious; even shows a bit of California-esque heat on the finish."
US,91,80,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Grassini 2013 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"Black cherry, licorice, loamy soil and a touch of roasted beef show on the nose of this bottling from a beautiful estate in the eastern Santa Ynez Valley. Black cherry, dried dill and fennel, coffee bean and slightly bitter dark chocolate come across on the palate that is still quite young with sticky tannins, though very easy to sip already."
US,86,26,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2013 Aveta Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"The inaugural vintage of this wine, named for a water goddess, this offers herb, grass, lemon and peach around a medium body influenced by some oak. As it develops in the glass, tropical fruit unfurls in a refreshing spritz before settling down to a tart finish."
US,87,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,:Nota Bene 2011 Miscela Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Cabernet Sauvignon (66%) takes the lead on this Bordeaux-style blend, followed by Cabernet Franc (16%), Merlot (12%) and Malbec. Aromas of anise, dried herbs, dried cherries and tomato leaf are followed by lighter-styled medicinal flavors that linger."
US,90,22,Pinot Noir,red,Monte Ferro 2013 Dion Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This is becoming a golden age for quality, value-oriented Oregon Pinot Noir. But within that broad category, there are very few single-vineyard, Willamette Valley entries. Add this to the list. All Pommard clone, 30% new French oak, and a pale, lovely shade of rose, this brings substantial berry, root beer, earth and iron flavors into play. Complex and refined, it has subtle power."
US,88,13,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Oliver 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (America),"Iconic Sauvignon Blanc notes of pink grapefruit, gooseberry, mango and papaya shine brightly on the nose and palate. Ample weight, with balanced acidity and crisp, clean flavors mark this well-made wine at a bargain price."
US,85,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cimarone 2011 Three Creek Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"This Cabernet has a rather bubblegummy, candied, gassy taste. It's exuberantly ripe in cherries, red currants and mocha, and fun to drink, but expensive."
Italy,87,40,Red Blend,red,Le Caniette 2005 Nero di Vite  (Rosso Piceno),"This aged blend of 50% Sangiovese and 50% Montelpulciano opens with black fruit and oak aromas. The dense palate delivers dense raspberry and wild cherry, layered with clove and chocolate alongside dusty tannins."
US,88,30,Zinfandel,red,Seven Oxen 2013 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Dark alpine strawberry and black plum notes converge on the nose of this wine, which also offers a tart element. Vivacious black raspberry, pencil lead, crushed vanilla, clove and a slight herbal edge show on the palate, proving to be a more savory rather than fruity take on Zin."
US,90,25,Pinot Grigio,white,Benessere 2006 Pinot Grigio (Napa Valley),"There's a reason PG has become so popular in America, and this new one from Napa-based Benessere shows why. It's as dry and bright in acidity as a fine Sauvignon Blanc, yet with the rich fruit American wine drinkers love. Those flavors range from peaches and nectarines to Meyer lemons and pineapples, with honeysuckle and spice nuances."
US,84,42,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Cass 2005 Rockin' One Red (Paso Robles),"A blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache, this has a chocolate mint edge to the sugary sweet LifeSaver candy blackberries and cherries. The tannins and acids are good, though, and the wine would score higher if it were drier."
US,91,85,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,JM Cellars 2014 Founder's Legacy Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc shows prominent blue fruit aromas, with plum, mountain blueberry, herb and spice notes to round them out. The flavors are concentrated and texturally rich, providing a lot of appeal."
US,84,30,Red Blend,red,Northwest Totem Cellars 2006 QO-NE Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Lots of sweet fruit is right up front here—super ripe berry/cherry flavors—that quickly fade and leave a rather dull finish. It's two thirds Cabernet Franc, the rest a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and just a splash of Petit Verdot."
US,89,54,Merlot,red,Duckhorn 2010 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Hard as nails in tannins, with mouth-numbing astringency. But the powerful fruit explodes right through, offering an array of blackberry jam, dark chocolate, raisin and anise flavors. Try cellaring it until at least 2019."
France,91,70,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Jean Monnier et Fils 2014 Charmes Premier Cru  (Meursault),"From one of the most familiar of the Meursault Premier Crus, this wine is crisp and mineral in character. It has tight acidity with apple and green-plum fruit that is laced by a light amount of wood aging. The wine is still young and will be better from 2018."
US,95,85,Merlot,red,La Jota Vineyard 2013 Merlot (Howell Mountain),"The La Jota and W.S. Keyes vineyards are the sources for this classically styled wine that is intense and alive in minerality. Clove, black pepper and mountains of dried herb are front and center between firm, dusty tannin and oak. The texture is plush and velvety on the palate, with plenty of length on the finish."
Italy,89,45,Sangiovese,red,Casina di Cornia 2008 Vigna La Casina  (Chianti Classico),"This single-vineyard bottling begins with aromas of nearly overripe plum and black berries accompanied by whiffs of farmyard and wet soil. The palate loses this rustic note and delivers juicy red cherry layered with vanilla, espresso and toasted oak. It's a bit shy on freshness and finishes on a sweet note but it's still very enjoyable thanks to succulent primary fruit flavors."
US,85,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Liberated 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"This Cabernet comes in three different labels, displaying the archetypes of the explorer, the business man and the adventurer. In taste, the wine is smoky and soft, with plum, cassis and dark cherry all making a play."
US,86,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2007 Wetzel Family Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Soft and easy, this Cabernet has flavors of blackberries, cherries, herbs and sweet oak. It's an easy wine to drink now with steaks and chops."
France,91,104,Chardonnay,white,Joseph Faiveley 2011 Champ Gain Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),"Although this wine has a strong toasty character, it offers enough fruit, acidity and ripe tropical flavors to make it work. Attractive acidity gives a delicious, fresh aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
US,92,35,Zinfandel,red,Edmeades 2013 Gianoli Vineyard Zinfandel (Mendocino Ridge),"Intense fruitiness along with touches of mint and baking spices make this full-bodied wine impressive as well as complex and layered. The vivid, ripe strawberry and blackberry components are well balanced by firm tannins and a light oak coating."
Italy,85,18,Red Blend,red,Fattoria Fibbiano 2012 Casalini  (Chianti Superiore),"Aromas of ripe—nearly overripe—black fruit, sweat and wet fur lead the nose. The palate offers fleshy black cherry, crushed plum, coconut and espresso alongside drying tannins."
US,87,13,Pinot Noir,red,Castle Rock 2014 Pinot Noir (Mendocino County),"Medium body and an attractive earthy, oaky flavor profile make this wine a little different from the norm and a great value. It has complexity in the red cherry, rhubarb and sweet-spice flavors, and a supple texture with a touch of tannin."
France,95,65,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine Vacheron 2014 Les Romains  (Sancerre),"Named in honor of the Romans who first planted vines in Sancerre, this wine has its feet firmly in the chalk soil that gives it richness as well as minerality. Ripe with touches of yellow fruits as well as lime and other citrus flavors, it is structured, dense and likely to age well. Drink from 2018."
France,87,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château le Gardera 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur,Ripe fruit aromas give this wine its full-bodied feel. It has acidity and spicy tannins while the rich fruit theme continues. It should develop well and be ready from 2018.
US,85,40,Pinot Noir,red,Bouchaine 2012 Bacchus Collection Mariafeld Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"From a particular block of an estate vineyard, this is a high-strung, high-acid Pinot that's earthy and piquant on the tongue. The aromas offer a mix of spearmint and dried herb."
US,90,56,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,AuburnJames 2012 Phaeton Red (Napa Valley),"This wine includes all five traditional red-Bordeaux varieties, Merlot the most dominant, resulting in tart Bing cherry and cassis flavors. It doesn't hold back on tannin or power, showing grippy persistence on the finish."
US,87,35,Pinot Noir,red,Carpe Diem 2012 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Burgundian in its earthy, feral aromas, yet simultaneously jammy in flavor, this boasts gamy undertones and a soft texture. The producer recommends decanting an hour minimum before serving, and this will most likely help to blow off the wine's rustically wild side."
US,91,34,Syrah,red,Silver Mountain 2012 Syrah (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Blended from Muns Vineyard near the mountaintop and Wiedemen Ranch near the base of the appellation, this bottling offers cola, black plum, Concord grape and dried rose petal scents on the complex and elegant nose. The flavors are layered and woven on the palate, evoking elderberry, charcoal and purple flower touches."
US,89,45,Sangiovese,red,Altamura 2004 Sangiovese (Napa Valley),"Altamura has tackled this extremely difficult wine for years. They've settled on a style that's soft and silky, with complex flavors of cherries, dates, plum skins, cocoa and pepper, and the weight of a Pinot Noir."
US,82,25,Merlot,red,Cedar River Cellars 2010 Watershed Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The herbal, thin fruit is covered with a strong streak of vanilla. It finishes with bitter tannins."
France,90,28,Pinot Gris,white,Domaine Rieflé-Landmann 2013 Seppi Landmann Vallée Noble Pinot Gris (Alsace),"While it's rich, this beautiful dry wine also offers considerable freshness. Acidity cuts easily through the ripe white fruit, pear and red apples, allowing room for spice that provides a contrasting aftertaste."
US,88,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Martin Ray 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This dry, full-bodied wine has lots of rich, exuberant blackberry and black currant flavors accented by smoky oak. It's a little heavy, and not likely to age, so decant it for a few hours before service."
US,89,20,Pinot Noir,red,A to Z 2006 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Though fruit-driven, forward and accessible, this surprises with the chewy density of its midpalate, and the depth and texture of the finish. It begins with somewhat sweet with candy flavors of raspberries, red currants and Bing cherries. Then it opens up, adding moist earth, minerals, flint and wisps of chocolaty smoke. Firm acidity and a balanced structure complete this classically proportioned and well-defined wine. An amazing 51,000 cases were made."
US,92,85,Syrah,red,Rasa 2009 Principia Reserve Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Firm and muscular, this has a supple core of blue and purple fruits, plus balancing acids, ripe tannins and no overt oak influence. It's long and seamless."
US,85,32,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Airfield Estates 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),"Though labeled reserve, this is barely distinguishable from the winery's regular Cabernet. More toast, and a little chocolate is showing, but the fruit flavors—pale blackberry and black currant—are quickly covered up by the aggressive tannins."
US,87,44,Pinot Noir,red,Waits-Mast 2008 Amber Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Soft and fruity, with raspberry, cherry, Dr. Pepper and oak flavors. It has the jammy, marmalade taste of freshly crushed berries, with citrusy acidity. The oak is front and center. Might develop with a few years in the bottle."
US,92,38,Zinfandel,red,Peachy Canyon 2012 Snow Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"The winery's smaller Zin projects are fantastic, and this is a great example, with aromas of strawberry extract mingling with mint, anise and leather. The palate is even more savory, with mushrooms, olives and herb-crusted roast beef, benefiting from ripe plum fruit as well."
US,87,16,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Santa Barbara Winery 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"Well-rounded pear and apple aromas get a fresh squeeze of lemon in this good-deal Sauv Blanc. It's easy to drink, with apple popover flavors (whose toasty elements come from the 20% barrel fermentation) and a brisk acidity."
France,91,65,Chardonnay,white,Duval-Leroy 2005 Clos des Bouveries Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"Made from grapes sourced from a single vineyard, this is an intensely minerally Champagne. It is dry and austere, with citrus fruits dominant. The wine needs to age to bring out all of the richness and toast flavor, but it will always be a structured Champagne. This is very much a food wine."
Italy,90,60,Red Blend,red,I Giusti e Zanza 2012 Dulcamara Red (Toscana),"Made with Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and a drop of Petit Verdot, this deeply colored wine offers aromas black plum, dried cherry and clove. The round, ripe palate doles out mature black cherry, blackberry, licorice and black pepper alongside firm, chewy tannins."
France,90,89,Chardonnay,white,J. Dumangin Fils NV Dessus le Mont Blanc de Blancs Premier Cru Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"Here's a wine that is fine and fresh as well as structured. Apple skin and citrus juice flavors are cut through with mature toast flavors. The result is rich, its mouthfeel full and its aftertaste tight and tangy."
US,91,55,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Frazier 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"You'll want to stash this young Cab away for a while because it's too closed and tannic now for enjoyment. But it has a very rich, concentrated core of cassis flavor and is dry and balanced in acidity. Should negotiate the next 6–8 years easily, and maybe longer."
US,93,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Quilceda Creek 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington),"Quilceda makes big, muscular Cabernets, but the power is tightly controlled and never out of whack. Firm cherry fruit is edged with mixed spices from barrel aging. Still young and hard, this is a tannic wine that clearly has the stuffing and structure to age indefinitely, but if drunk now will require many hours of breathing time. Editors' Choice."
US,87,38,Chardonnay,white,Olabisi 2010 Chappell Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Rich enough to drink now, this is dryish, crisply acidic and creamy, with pineapple sour candy and butterscotch flavors."
US,85,25,Chardonnay,white,St. Francis 2007 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"Creamy and tartly acidic, with sour pineapple candy, pear, buttered popcorn and vanilla flavors. Made in a popular style that will appeal to fans of oaky Chards."
US,90,55,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Kenefick Ranch 2013 Chris's Cuvée Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga),"Currant, cranberry and blueberry pop from the glass in this burly, brawny and full-bodied wine from the warm reaches of Calistoga. Soft, rounded tannins wrap themselves seamlessly around the juicy fruit and ample vanilla spice."
US,88,25,Syrah,red,Wolff 2014 Syrah (Edna Valley),"This has the potential to be a very exciting wine, needing time to truly tell. Grapeseed and candied violet scents show on the nose. The tannins are chunky now but may integrate, while blackberry and black pepper flavors suggest a better future."
US,88,18,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Vinum 2012 Veritas The Insider Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Producers Chris Condos and Richard Bruno put together a fairly priced wine, with aromas of herbed pie crust surrounding warm blackberry fruit. There's more smoked meat on the palate than ripe fruit, and it is quite tannic, so can handle heavy fare."
US,92,50,Red Blend,red,Chester Kidder 2011 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Syrah and 7% Petit Verdot, this wine saw 30 months in barrel. Aromas of blackberry, licorice, herb, dark coffee and earth are primary and lead to full-bodied flavors that persist on the finish."
US,87,8,Zinfandel,red,Redwood Creek 2008 Frei Brothers Vineyards Zinfandel (Lodi),"A remarkably juicy, berry, cherry Zin that's fully in balance and easy to drink, not to mention a great price."
US,84,34,Chardonnay,white,Gracianna 2010 Suzanne's Blend Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Sweet oak, buttered toast and buttered popcorn dominate this Chardonnay. It has a creamy texture with underlying flavors of orange and pineapple jam."
France,86,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Brande-Bergère 2012 Cuvée O'Byrne  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"Juicy black fruits give a great start, supported by the tannins that kick in. Ripe, full of flavor and generous, this is a broad, full-bodied wine. Drink from 2016."
US,95,75,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Martin Ray 2007 Synthesis Red (Napa Valley),"A terrific wine, smooth, complex and ageworthy. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon from Diamond Mountain, it shows mountain intensity of fruit, with a molten core of blackberries and black currants. The tannins are bigtime, yet smooth and refined in the modern style, and the finish is elaborate in fruits and spices. A monument to what this fine winery can achieve at the top level. Hold until 2015, after which it should provide great drinking for additional years."
Italy,85,16,Pinot Grigio,white,Bosco del Merlo 2011 Pinot Grigio (Venezia),"Modest aromas of cut grass, white flower and citrus establish this as an easy-drinking white. The finish is marked with a touch of green lime. It should pair well with shrimp cocktail or basil pesto."
US,89,18,White Blend,white,Monte Volpe 2015 Sesso White (Mendocino County),"This is a crisp, dry, and very tangy wine blended from Tocai Friulano, Pinot Blanc and Pinot Grigio. It sizzles with lemon, lime and green-apple flavors. While barrel fermented, it's not obviously oaky and seems to get its energy from high acidity instead. It will be brilliant with simply prepared shellfish, fried chicken or as a palate charger before a meal."
US,90,38,Pinot Noir,red,Wrath 2013 Ex Vite Pinot Noir (Monterey),"Meaning “from the vine,” this 100% whole-cluster bottling presents black cherry, tart pomegranate, graphite, baking spice and sage bark on the nose. There's lots of dark herbs and dark fruit on the palate as well as black-olive depth and black-slate minerality. With the density of herbs, it's a bit like chewing on sage and eucalyptus."
US,94,210,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Inglenook 2014 Rubicon Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Tiny amounts of Merlot and Petit Verdot were added to this succulent, elegant wine with cassis, cranberry and black cherry flavors and rounded structure. A light note of cocoa dust and soft texture balance its exotically spiced lushness with delicious integration."
Italy,91,13,Pinot Grigio,white,Tiefenbrunner 2016 Pinot Grigio (Vigneti delle Dolomiti),"White spring blossom and citrus aromas waft out of the glass. On the palate, crisp acidity brightens creamy apple, pear and tangerine zest. It's quite simply crisp and delicious."
US,94,46,Pinot Noir,red,El Lugar 2015 Rincon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"There's intensely sharp fruit character on the nose of this bottling from a single clone and block in this historic vineyard, with candied raspberry and pomegranate aromas that are leveled by Early Grey tea and pressed purple flowers. The palate is extremely lively and tightly structured, with dark boysenberry and candied raspberry flavors that rise into a minty finish."
US,83,33,Syrah,red,Anemoi 2012 Lips Syrah (Grand Valley),"Charred wood, espresso and thyme aromas lead onto the medium-full palate, which is supported by sturdy tannins. This Syrah would pair well with a pulled-pork hoagie."
US,91,55,Syrah,red,Saviah 2014 The Stones Speak Funk Estate Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Orange peel, fresh flower, black olive, moist earth and tire rubber aromas lead to intense, palate-coating fruit flavors in this Syrah. It doesn't seem to have fully blossomed yet but has all of the stuffing to suggest a long life ahead, with floral accents on the finish."
Italy,88,35,Sangiovese,red,Castello di Gabbiano 2005 Bellezza Sangiovese (Toscana),"Bellezza (100% Sangiovese that ages 16 months in oak) is a modern and succulent wine with a supple feel and very good density. Generous layers of spice, black pepper and wet earth back aromas of black currant and cherry. Drink this wine with stewed meats and potatoes au gratin."
US,90,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Frias 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"Give this Cabernet high marks for sheer lusciousness. It's ripe in blackberries, black cherries and currants, with a veneer of sweet oak. Not a longterm ager, so drink over the next five years."
US,87,22,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cameron Hughes 2008 Lot 290 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"Marked by rich, ripe fruit, this Cabernet explodes in blackberries, cherries and cedar. There's an earthy-sweet richness, like milk chocolate, and the tannins are thick, but soft, like velvet. Ready to drink now."
US,88,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Fortnight 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Pure and focused in flavor, this is a great example of a natural-tasting wine in which the cherry, strawberry and blackberry flavors inherent in the grapes shine through and there's little oak to complicate things. It is medium bodied, well balanced, with light tannins and mild acidity."
France,83,15,Chardonnay,white,Lupé-Cholet 2010  Bourgogne,"Fruity, ripe and round, this is simple Chardonnay that gives pleasure from its warm texture and softness. The apple flavor leads to a gentle finish."
US,91,55,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Conn Creek 2008 Newton Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"Mount Veeder Cabernets usually have tough tannins, making the Cabernets ageworthy, but this 100% varietal bottling neither requires cellaring nor will reward it. Enjoy the tight astringency now for its upfront blackberry, black currant and cassis flavors."
France,89,26,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Patient Cottat 2012 Anciennes Vignes  (Menetou-Salon),"Not just old vines, but ancient vines, this is a juicy, concentrated and ripe wine. It is sufficiently rich and textured to need some aging to bring out the full fruits even more. Drink from 2014."
US,90,44,Chardonnay,white,Woodward Canyon 2012 Chardonnay (Washington),"Round and succulent, this nicely-defined Chardonnay is built around a core of apple butter with a slight suggestion of pineapple. A streak of butterscotch fills in the finish."
US,88,15,Riesling,white,Red Newt Cellars 2015 Circle Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Heady tropical notes of guava and melon perfume this light-footed wine. Semidry in style, it's not deeply penetrating in fruit but offers refreshing citrus flavors and a lip-smacking honey finish. Drink now through 2019."
Italy,85,12,White Blend,white,Principe Pallavicini 2014  Frascati,"Intense floral aromas of acacia flower and jasmine lead the nose on this informal wine. The palate is rather lean, but offers notes of citrus zest and green pear alongside brisk acidity."
US,90,34,Pinot Noir,red,Last Light 2012 Derbyshire Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo),"With zesty acidity, this Pinot shows all the marks of a wine that wants two or three years in the cellar. Right now, it's delicately structured, dry and tart, with cranberry, sour cherry candy and ripe tomato flavors. A few years in the cellar will bring out a mushroomy earthiness that will make the wine extremely satisfying."
US,88,23,Riesling,white,Waxwing 2016 Tondre Grapefield Riesling (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This wine's aromas are slightly reserved at first, recalling yellow pear and chalk. The flavors are also restrained on the zippy palate, with Asian pear and honeysuckle hints. But what it lacks in expressivity it makes up for in crispness and textural grip."
Italy,87,19,Red Blend,red,Guerrieri Rizzardi 2015 Classico  (Bardolino Chiaretto),"This spicy rosato opens with aromas of small red berry, blue flower and a whiff of baking spice. The bright, juicy palate offers wild cherry, raspberry, cinnamon and a hint of white pepper alongside fresh acidity."
Italy,93,80,Sangiovese,red,Ruffino 2011 Greppone Mazzi  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Lovely floral scents of violet and iris mingle with dark fruit and a whiff of exotic spice. The elegant, structured palate offers fleshy black cherry, ripe raspberry, white pepper, anise and chopped mint alongside fine-grained tannins. A hint of mocha closes the finish. It's already tempting but hold to let this unwind and fully develop. Drink 2019–2026."
Italy,88,24,Pinot Grigio,white,Venica & Venica 2014 Jesera Pinot Grigio (Collio),"Showing copper reflections, this vibrant wine offers enticing scents of white wildflower and orchard fruit. The savory palate presents poached Bartlett pear, nectarine zest and a mineral note accompanied by firm acidity."
France,94,62,Pinot Noir,red,Louis Jadot 2013 Les Boucherottes Premier Cru  (Beaune),"A generous wine, this features intense dark fruits, ripe strawberry and an almost -weet character. It's packed with spice, richness and beautiful concentration. Great acidity gives a wine that is developing freshness and weight. Drink from 2020."
US,88,44,Pinot Noir,red,Belle Glos 2008 Clark & Telephone Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Tremendously rich and ripe, this Pinot just dazzles the palate with waves of raspberries, cherries, cocoa, red licorice, bacon and other intense umami flavors. It's dry and silky, but the drawback is excessive softness."
US,88,15,Chardonnay,white,Lujon 2015 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"A chunky wine, this offers big, blocky flavors of oak, apple butter and melon. Round and forward, this is straightforward and perfectly enjoyable."
US,83,10,Pinot Noir,red,Castello di Borghese NV Fleurette Pinot Noir (North Fork of Long Island),"A lightweight Pinot that's actually marketed as a rose, this wine nevertheless manages to pack in decent flavors of apple skin, red berries and cinnamon, capped off by some leathery, meaty notes."
US,91,28,Pinot Noir,red,Alta Maria 2012 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Strong pencil shaving aromas open this 80% whole-cluster wine by James Ontiveros and Paul Wilkins, along with the dusty scents of raspberry fruit and violet petals preserved in pages of an old book. It's light and lean once sipped, with cranberry and raspberry fruits dancing across the tongue alongside green tobacco leaf, olive tapenade and peppery spices."
US,83,11,Pinot Noir,red,Haute Red 2010 Pinot Noir (California),"Judging by the high-heeled shoe on the label, this is one of those wines aimed at the female consumer. It's Pinot in name only, with clean, simple cherry candy and oak tastes."
Italy,88,20,Sangiovese,red,Molino di Sant'Antimo 2015  Rosso di Montalcino,"Here's a luminous red that opens with red berry, sun-baked soil and Mediterranean herb aromas. It's medium-bodied and approachable, delivering wild cherry, star anise and clove flavors, supported by polished tannins."
France,92,81,Chardonnay,white,Chanson Père et Fils 2010 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),"This is rich and ripe, with just a touch of wood influence. It has a tropical fruit and lime flavor, with lemon zest acidity. It is full, very structured and mineral, adding the complexity of ripe fruit. Age for 3–4 years."
US,91,65,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Januik 2013 Reserve Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (87%), Merlot (10%) and Cabernet Franc, with the fruit coming from Weinbau, Champoux, Lady Hawk and Ciel du Cheval vineyards. Light aromas of cocoa, herb, earth and cassis are followed by focused fruit flavors. It puts a premium on elegance."
US,88,49,Pinot Noir,red,MacPhail 2012 Sundawg Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"There's plenty of earthiness to this wine. Tart cherry and cranberry lead the way on the palate, amidst dense, rich tannins and plenty of oak. The acidity is most prominent on the midpalate."
France,85,14,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Ferraton Pere et Fils 2008 Samorëns Red (Côtes du Rhône),"Amply displays the charms and shortocmings of the 2008 vintage: complex if slightly herbal cherry fruit, medium body and great freshness. Drink now–2013."
US,89,24,Syrah,red,Owen Roe 2009 Ex Umbris Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Spicy and bright, with an almost-too-ripe note to the fruit. Sweet ripe berries are joined by hints of sweet tomato and fecund, autumnal flavors, suggesting that this Syrah should be consumed sooner rather than later."
US,85,48,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Kelly Family Vineyards 2013 Red (Napa Valley),"A majority of Cabernet Sauvignon is blended with 22% Merlot in this woody, somewhat herbal and robustly intense red, impacted in subtle ways by oak. The finish is meager."
US,90,21,Pinot Gris,white,Ross Andrew 2014 Celilo Vineyard Pinot Gris (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"Most of the fruit for this wine comes from this vineyard's 1975 plantings. It brings nuanced aromas of pear and mineral, drinking just a hair off dry, with more than ample acidity to balance out the fleshy flavors. The finish lasts a long time."
US,87,13,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Francis Berwyn 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Coast),"A fine, classic California Sauvignon Blanc that demonstrates showy ripeness balanced with dryness, crispness and low alcohol. The pineapple, lemon, pear and lemongrass flavors have a honeyed finish."
US,87,15,Chardonnay,white,Tamarack Cellars 2015 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas of pear, apple, and whiffs of tropical fruit are followed by a tart lively palate full of rounded fruit flavors. It shows a light spritz and a lot of crispness."
US,84,16,Chardonnay,white,Stave & Hoop 2009 Lot 55 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"Here's a soft, seemingly sweet and simple wine, with jammy orange, mango and buttered toast flavors."
US,91,15,Pinot Gris,white,Elk Cove 2001 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Pinot gris as it should be — ripe and full-bodied, with expressive flavors of fresh pears, spiced with cinnamon. Rich and satisfying, yet tangy enough to accompany even delicate seafood. This is a home run, with just enough of a hint of barrel to give it a finishing kiss of butterscotch."
France,87,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Les Hauts de Palette 2014  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux,"Big tannins dominate this still young wine. It has spice and a dry toast character that will need to soften. With acidity and hints of red fruits that should happen, so drink this wine from 2019 when its potential should be realized."
France,88,63,Pinot Noir,red,Chanson Père et Fils 2013 Beauregard Premier Cru  (Santenay),This wine is ripe with generous strawberry flavors and perfumed acidity. A smoky edge accompanies tastes of red cherry. The wine is rounded and light with attractive final acidity.
Italy,89,65,Sangiovese,red,I Sodi 2011 Vigna Farsina Sangiovese (Toscana),"Made entirely from Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of black plum, vanilla and toast. The concentrated palate doles out black cherry jam, cedar and tobacco alongside assertive tannins. Drink through 2019."
France,90,24,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine Masson-Blondelet 2008 Thauvenay  (Sancerre),"A big, rich style of Sancerre, but one that doesn't forget its mineral, flinty roots. The acidity has an edge of sweetness, opened by delicious berry fruit flavors, tangy in its citrus freshness. It could age for another 1–2 years."
US,91,59,Syrah,red,La Fenêtre 2009 Bien Nacido Vineyard Z Block Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),"Here's a big, rich, tannic Syrah that's full bodied and dense, and exploding with blackberry, currant, mocha, cedar and spice flavors. Notable for its tannin structure, it's clearly made from well-grown grapes, and balanced in structure. It's resistant now, however, holding its best under a cloak of astringency. Should begin to mellow around 2015 and really take off through 2020."
US,86,46,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Naggiar 2012 La Boheme Estate Reserve Red (Sierra Foothills),"The aroma is very ripe, almost like a Port wine. Flavors are deep and ripe, with a twinge of dried fruit, and the texture is appropriately firm and tannic. It's a bold, hearty and full-bodied Bordeaux-style blend."
US,86,18,Pinot Noir,red,Sebastiani 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Light bodied and modest in flavor, with lots of acidity. You find yourself wishing there was more in the way of fruit. Still, it's pretty good for the price, with a nice, silky texture."
US,93,50,Pinot Noir,red,Boheme 2009 Taylor Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Enormously attractive, this has a rich, creamy texture and complex flavors. Notes of raspberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper and persimmons flood the palate, riding a wave of spice, smoky oak and a beautiful touch of mushroomy earthiness. This is a first class Pinot Noir, with food-friendly elegance."
US,81,10,Pinot Noir,red,Dante 2012 Reserve Pinot Noir (California),"This is an uninteresting wine, dry and acidic, with watered-down raspberry flavors."
US,82,26,Syrah,red,Lucas & Lewellen 2006 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Dull and vegetal, with modest cherry flavors. But the texture is smooth and the finish is dry."
Italy,93,60,Syrah,red,Fattoria Terre del Marchesato 2004 Marchesale Syrah (Toscana),"Proprietor Maurizio Fuselli's 100% Syrah from coastal Tuscany—his debut vintage—could not be more encouraging. The wine exhibits pure berry fruit: Blackberry and cherry is backed by leather, spice and cigar box. The wine has tight, solid tannins, good length and a long, cherry-driven finish."
US,89,10,Chardonnay,white,Gnarly Head 2013 Chardonnay (California),"This offers that tempting aroma of toasted baguette with a dab of butter, then the flavors flow fresh and peachy, while the texture feels smooth and the body not too full. Well balanced between flavors, acidity and body, it brings refreshment to sip after another."
US,91,40,Pinot Noir,red,Bucher 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Since planting in 1997, Bucher Vineyard has been a renowned source of Pinot Noir for exceptional local wineries. Now the Bucher family is making their own wine, with good results. The wine is dry, fresh and keen in acidity, and has considerable weight, with ripe, forward raspberry, cherry, bacon, sautéed wild mushroom and exotic spice flavors. However, it's still too young. Begin to enjoy it around 2018."
US,85,8,Zinfandel,red,Talus 1998 Zinfandel (California),"Plenty of herbal, mushroomy notes in the nose. The wine is light, soft and fruity. The mushroom flavors could be a real asset with the right food. Finishes true to form, with nothing off."
US,83,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Cameron Hughes 2012 Lot 393 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa County),"While this wine is dry and crisp with acidity, it straddles the border of ripeness. On the plus side are vibrant lemon, lime and honey flavors. On the downside is a green, feline streak."
France,86,20,Pinot Gris,white,Cave de Kientzheim-Kaysersberg 2011 Anne de K Pinot Gris (Alsace),"This is a ripe and spicy wine that is full of almond and tropical fruit flavors. It has a sense of richness and texture, along with a kick of pepper. The acidity is a touch light here, but there's just enough to keep it fresh."
US,87,10,Chardonnay,white,Fox Run 2012 Doyle Family Vineyard Unoaked Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Dusty mineral and saline notes lend interest to aromatic peach and apricot on this pretty, perfumed Chardonnay. The palate is refreshingly mineral, while the finish is brisk and nervy."
US,91,23,Chardonnay,white,Moniker 2015 Chardonnay (Mendocino County),"This elegant wine combines subtle nutmeg and cardamom aromas with crisp apple, bosc pear and mild vanilla-bean flavors. Its firm texture and lingering finish bring everything into balance, with no single element overpowering the others, making it a pleasure to sip."
US,84,35,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Dragonette 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"A controversial wine that will have its fans. Dryness and acidity make it a little sour, and a medicinal taste invades the citrus and tropical fruits."
US,86,12,Red Blend,red,Casto Oaks 2013 Man's Best Blend Red (Sierra Foothills),"This hearty, firm-textured wine is very dark in color and saturated with ripe cherry, tart cranberry and boysenberry flavors. Dry and rather tannic, it needs a robust dish to pair with."
US,86,13,Sangiovese,red,Cavatappi 2014 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This youthful wine offers aromas of fresh raspberries, plum and tire rubber. The flavors are soft and generous, with tart acids and no new oak anywhere in sight. It doesn't seem entirely varietal but brings appeal all the same."
US,89,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Woodinville Wine Cellars 2010 Little Bear Creek Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Another fine vintage for this value-priced, Bordeaux-style blend. It's loaded with raspberry and black cherry flavors, then brings in lighter notes of dried herb, ground coffee and dark chocolate. For its price, it delivers rather complex and well-integrated flavors."
US,90,23,Chardonnay,white,DaMa 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Sagemoor and Conner Lee grapes go into this soft, plush, totally drinkable Chardonnay. Pretty fruit flavors of banana, apple and pear mingle seamlessly, and the wine has both balance and texture to spare. Drink it now for its poise and freshness."
France,93,73,Chardonnay,white,Henri de Villamont 2010 Morgeots Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),"This is an impressively powerful, concentrated wine. It shows its wood aging now, but those notes should integrate soon into all the ripe apricot and greengage flavors. Richly textured, this is a wine that needs aging, so don't drink before 2016."
US,91,27,Pinot Gris,white,King Estate 2014 Backbone Pinot Gris (Oregon),"This is a compelling example of Oregon Pinot Gris. Apple, pear and lemon curd carry the bulk of the flavors, with a lightly peppery lift to the midpalate. The spicy character extends through a pleasing, long finish."
US,91,40,Chardonnay,white,Franciscan 2014 Cuvée Sauvage Chardonnay (Carneros),"Beautifully oaked, this youthful, robustly expressive wine is lemony and salty, offering a high-toned minerality that plays out as stony texture. Pear and marzipan flavors dominate, accented by vanilla and nutmeg."
US,93,26,Pinot Noir,red,Melville 2010 Verna's Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Ripeness marks this Pinot. It floods the mouth with jammy raspberries and cherries, brightened with acidity. Seems a bit straightforward by virtue of sheer dazzle, but it is a superb example of the Santa Rita Hills, at a good price."
US,91,85,Pinot Noir,red,Archery Summit 2012 Whole Cluster Cuvée Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"The fermentation with the stems intact brings some earthy qualities front and center, to good effect. This is the most distinctive entry among the winery's eight Pinots, further enhanced by the use of wild yeasts. Scents of clover and hints of watercress and bark highlight the flavors of beetroot and brambly berry fruit. You will have fun playing this against a variety of potential food matchups."
US,91,30,Zinfandel,red,Saldo 2014 Zinfandel (California),"Saldo comes from the folks who brought you The Prisoner. Admirable ripeness and lushness carry this full-bodied, dark-colored and densely fruity wine from a smoky aroma through jammy dark-fruit flavors to a lingering finish that has a drop of baking-spice sweetness."
US,86,11,Red Blend,red,Wild Meadows 2012 Red Beauty Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Lighter in color, this Syrah (83%)-dominated blend shows aromas of dehydrated blueberries, milk chocolate, black olive and plum. The blue fruit flavors are lightly sweet, with some residual sugar holding it together."
France,87,12,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Lary 2015  Bordeaux Blanc,"With vineyards located in the far southeast of the Bordeaux appellation, this wine is very crisp and clean, this is a fruity wine, packed with green plum, citrus and sliced apple flavors. It is ready to drink now with its bright acidity and lightly perfumed aftertaste."
US,89,40,Chardonnay,white,Walt 2011 La Brisa Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"Ripe and honeyed in vanilla, buttered toast, tropical fruit and orange jam flavors, this Chardonnay is lifted by vibrant acidity and a tangy minerality, like a lick of steel that lends it backbone. It defines the modern style with elegance."
US,85,15,Riesling,white,San Juan Vineyards 2012 Les Vignes De Marcoux Riesling (Yakima Valley),"The residual sugar is a hefty 54g/L. Soft flavors of canned peaches and apricots fill the mouth immediately, then turn watery as the wine quickly slides into a lighter finish."
Italy,88,20,Red Blend,red,Gagliole 2011 Rubiolo  (Chianti Classico),"This medium-bodied wine opens with aromas of meat juice, tobacco leaf, plum and blackberry. The warm, forward palate offers juicy black cherry, thyme, espresso and toasted notes alongside round but present tannins. This is already extremely approachable, so enjoy soon."
US,94,49,Pinot Noir,red,MacPhail 2009 Raye's Hill Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"A sweet, soft, harmonious Pinot Noir. Feels so gentle in the mouth, it hardly has any weight, yet it's a very serious wine. The flavors are enormous, suggesting ripe wild cherries, raspberry liqueur and baking spices, finished with perfectly applied, smoky oak, and brightened with fine acidity. A wine of great charm, it should continue to develop in the bottle for six years."
US,91,60,Pinot Noir,red,Blue Farm 2013 Anne Katherina Vineyard Estate Farmed Pinot Noir (Carneros),"From a larger portion of viticulturist Anne Moller-Racke's home vineyard, this wine needs time to unravel itself out of a compact and concentrated funk of cedar and mint. The tannin weight is present and powerful. Roses and wild raspberries form a pact of flavor and beguiling aromatic invitation."
US,91,125,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Dos Lagos Vineyards 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),"Velvety smooth and lengthy on the palate, this 100% varietal, estate-grown wine from an appellation known for power and robust flavor reveals a depth of black licorice, clove and plum amidst a richness of peppery meat, which would also suggest a fine pairing. Part of its beauty is the abundance of violet aromas on the nose."
Italy,88,22,Red Blend,red,Querciabella 2011 Mongrana  (Maremma Toscana),"Spiced plum, dried herbs, underbrush and toasted oak aromas waft out of the glass. A blend of 50% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot, the palate offers up ripe black currant, crushed mint, espresso and tobacco accompanied by fine-grained tannins."
US,89,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Galante 2009 Red Rose Hill Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Carmel Valley),"There's lots of vitality to this Cab, which was blended with Petite Sirah, Merlot and Malbec. It's complex on the palate with a spectrum of flavors ranging from blackberries and cherries to herbs and mushrooms. It's silky in texture and thoroughly dry in style. Drink now–2015."
France,95,115,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils 2009 Clos des Hospices Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),"A superbly rich wine, with its acidity well integrated into the concentrated and rounded fruit. It has great texture and fruit that bursts from the glass. It is generous, warm and toasty, while also preserving the steeliness that is hallmark of the Les Clos vineyard. Age for at least five years."
Italy,89,36,Red Blend,red,Villa S. Anna 2013  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,"Delicate coconut, vanilla and plum aromas mingle in the glass. The subtle palate reveals licorice, cherry extract, espresso and a hint of vanilla, held together by tightly wound tannins and fresh acidity."
US,90,60,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Silverpoint Cellars 2011 Red (Napa Valley),"This is a majority Cabernet Sauvignon, with equal parts Merlot and Petit Verdot and a smaller addition of Cabernet Franc. It speaks to the coolness of the vintage in its dried-herb characteristics and light-bodied smoothness of integrated tannin."
US,87,24,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Steven Kent 2013 Lola Sauvignon Blanc (Livermore Valley),"A bold white wine, it smells and tastes like grapefruit, canteloupe and very crisp apples. It has a fresh, acidic texture that cleans the palate and makes the mouth water, but wraps in enough richness for good balance."
US,91,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Kitá 2013 Kalas Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"Made for the Chumash Casino-owning tribe by descendant Tara Gomez, this 54% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc, 18% Petit Verdot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon shows black plum, blueberry, turned loam, minty chocolate and the slightest touch of oregano on the nose. The palate is framed by silky tannins, conveying blackberries with mocha, purple flowers and beef char. It's built to last, so drink 2017–2028."
US,84,33,Red Blend,red,Northwest Totem Cellars 2007 Low Man Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aggressively tannic, this is an earthy red wine with a lot of barrel influence. The fruit vanishes into a mélange of pepper, clove, coffee and tannin."
US,90,85,Pinot Noir,red,Archery Summit 2012 Archer's Edge Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"The vineyard is one of the youngest at the winery, and the flavors reflect that, with bright, fruity, forward raspberry notes. It's lightly spiked with sweet baking spices, and makes a perfectly delicious choice while waiting for some of the winery's bigger, bolder 2012s to age a bit further."
US,84,24,Pinot Noir,red,Schug 2007 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Dry and a little harsh in texture, this Pinot shows flavors of cherries, green mint candy and oak. It's dry and silky. Production was 16,663 cases."
US,92,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Neyers 2013 Neyers Ranch Conn Valley Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Black color shows a depth of extraction in this earthy, burly wine. It reveals layers of leather, cedar and tobacco most, with a billowy tannin structure providing a foundation for additional elements of meaty black fruit and graphite."
US,88,20,Merlot,red,Wölffer 2012 Merlot (Long Island),"Darker notes of espresso and dried herbs contrast with fragrant blossom and cherry aromas on this plump, full-bodied wine. Supple like silk, it's rich and ripe with cherry and plum flavors blanketed soft, chalky tannin."
US,90,22,Chardonnay,white,Gainey 2015 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Fresh squeezed lime, apple cider and wet stone aromas meet with a touch of mulling spice on the nose of this appellation blend, which is excellently priced. The palate is clean and crisp, with pear and lime flavors as well as a touch of salt."
US,92,44,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Woodward Canyon 2005 Artist Series #14 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is taut and dense, and requires time and air to untangle. Deep, dark fruits are mixed in with layers of black olive, smoke, compost, tar, moist earth and herb—a delicious mélange of flavors that promises good things to come as the wine ages. It's masterful winemaking in a package so young and wrapped up tight that it may pass you by if you don't give it a good look."
US,89,50,Pinot Noir,red,Argyle 2015 Nuthouse Master Series Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Black-cherry fruit comes wreathed in light smoke, with a streak of root beer adding to the flavor. This is a wine of medium weight and concentration, with hints of fennel throughout."
Italy,92,53,Red Blend,red,Boscarelli 2012 Riserva  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"This structured red offers plum, violet, toast, balsamic and menthol aromas. The taut palate delivers red cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and orange zest flavors, set against fine-grained tannins. An espresso note closes the finish."
US,90,55,Pinot Noir,red,Russian River Vineyards 2009 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Rich flavors of cherries, persimmons, cola, anise and oak flood the mouth with immediate deliciousness. Bright Russian River acidity provides fortunate balance. It's delicious now, but young; this has the balance to develop nicely, so give it 6–7 years."
France,91,37,Chardonnay,white,Roger Lassarat 2008 Clos de France  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"Ripe and soft, with a texture that is well balanced, this wine has peach and apricot flavors marrying well with the layers of wood. There is a strong, fresh element to give the wine a final lift."
US,93,25,Pinot Noir,red,Sarah's Vineyard 2013 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"This amazing wine can match up against wines double the price. Brawny red berries and wild cherries mix with cut sagebrush, eucalyptus and crushed graphite on the nose. The palate combines bright red, acid-driven raspberry fruit with the darker structure of elderberry. Throw in thyme and bay leaf for the complete package."
US,87,22,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Veritas 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Monticello),"Scents of caramelized grapefruit zest and tropical fruit take the fore. Lively acids frame the silky, medium-bodied palate."
US,87,15,Chardonnay,white,Cosentino 2009 The Chard Chardonnay (California),"Good price for a Chardonnay this rich and satisfying. It's oaky and ripe and flamboyant in orange and pineapple fruit, yet a brisk cut of acidity and minerality saves it from being too sweet."
US,91,26,Syrah,red,Bianchi 2011 Heritage Selection Syrah (Paso Robles),"Licorice, blackberry extract and a slate-driven mineral element power the complex nose. There's great tension between hearty, ripe olallieberry fruit and bitter plum skins on the palate, resulting in one of the winery's best 2011s."
US,85,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Billsboro 2012 Sawmill Creek Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Finger Lakes),"There's a tinge of herbaceous green stem amidst fresh apple and lemon aromas on this Sauvignon Blanc blended with 10% Albariño. Marked with nervous lime acidity, it's lean on the palate with a hint of lime-skin bitterness on the finish."
Italy,84,15,Sangiovese,red,Poderi dal Nespoli 1929 2011 Prugneto  (Sangiovese di Romagna Superiore),"Here's a very correct and clean Sangiovese with bright cherry nuances and blueberry followed by a touch of bitter almond. The mouthfeel is thin, easy and watery."
US,91,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Double Canyon 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"Wood spice, herb, tangerine peel and blue- and black-fruit aromas are followed by a fresh, flavorful palate. The grip of the tannins makes the variety unmistakable and the balance is spot on."
US,91,55,Red Blend,red,Left Bend NV Mashup v. 2 Red (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This fascinating nonvintage solera blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc from five vintages (2010–2014) offers elegant touches of licorice, blackcurrant and lavender on the deep nose. Blackberry, cedar, sandalwood and incense flavors mesh with a dried tea-leaf element on the palate."
US,88,17,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Kingman 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Grand Valley),"Cedar and cigar box are most prominent on the nose, followed by hints of blackberry and currant. The palate boasts cigar box, leather and raw oak with more currant and pomegranate offering levity. Medium tannins lend structure and carry through to the cedar flecked finish."
US,88,29,Red Blend,red,Murrieta's Well 2007 Zarzuela Red (Livermore Valley),"A well-made blend of Spanish and Portuguese red varietals, with the majority Tempranillo, with bright red cherry and cranberry and high acidic tones that's also got a touch of lovely minerality, olive, toffee and vanilla. The 2007 is ready to drink now, a well-balanced easy drinker with great aromatics and not too much tannin."
US,89,42,Syrah,red,Nefarious 2008 Rocky Mother Vineyard Estate Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is Syrah from the far northwest corner of the Columbia Valley, a cool region, whose wines show an underlying minerality. The berry flavors are subtle; this is a mélange of leaf, herb, rock and acid. Still young, the tannins are drying and the wine seems to be entering a dumb phase. Give it plenty of breathing time."
France,94,310,Pinot Noir,red,Louis Latour 2012 Cuvée Héritiers Latour  (Chambertin),"Aged in 100% new wood, this massive wine is full of dark plum and fragrant strawberries. It is also packed with dark tannins that give the wine a dry core. The fruitiness has a strongly juicy character, fragrant with acidity and freshness. The end is a reminder that this is a powerful wine. Drink from 2020."
US,87,22,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Peter Franus 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Carneros),"A delicious Sauvignon Blanc. Make it drier, and it would be perfect. As it is, it's a little too sugary sweet in pineapples, lemons and oranges, but crisp acidity and a firm minerality help to restore balance."
US,87,12,Zinfandel,red,Tortoise Creek 2015 The Chelonian Zinfandel (Lodi),"Sweet-seeming fruit and maple flavors give a candy-like quality to this medium-bodied, ripe and soft wine. The vanilla and maple flavors meld nicely with rich raspberry and sweet cherry notes."
US,92,29,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Amavi 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Fragrant and young, this Cab bursts with juicy berry fruit flavors. Brambly raspberry, a whiff of mint, plenty of cassis and a dusting of spice all combine in a well-structured wine ready for the table. Firm and supported with mineral-soaked acids, this has the texture, tannins and push-through to age gracefully, though it's perfectly ready right now."
US,85,23,Red Blend,red,Truett Hurst 2012 California Square Red (Paso Robles),"Ripe, opulent blackberry, cherry, butterscotch and vanilla bean flavors mark this soft wine. You can drink it now with everyday fare like beef tacos and cheeseburgers."
US,90,34,Zinfandel,red,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2012 Mancini Ranch Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Subdued and delicately ripe, this wine offers understated notions of leather, chocolate and blackberry bramble, with an electric undercurrent of fresh-squeezed citrus. Light and bright, this is a study in holding back, with complexity at its core."
France,92,62,Riesling,white,Emile Beyer 2014 Eichberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"A little earthiness on the nose blows off to reveal a very concentrated and sweepingly apple-flavored palate which pitches generous, ripe fruit against welcome, tart freshness. This is open and and very joyous, fresh and utterly fruit-driven with a lasting, very moreish finish."
US,85,16,White Blend,white,X 2011 White X White (California),"There are lots of orange, pineapple, Meyer lemon, lime, honey and spice flavors in this blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Arneis and Gewürztraminer. It's brisk in acidity and a little sweet. Try pairing it with Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai foods."
US,89,18,Zinfandel,red,Easton 2012 Zinfandel (Amador County),"This is an amazing price for such quality, the wine resplendent in accessible red cherry and blackberry fruit and leathery tannins. Elegant and fairly restrained, it's soft, structured and young, with room to develop further. Juicy and creamy, it delivers minty spice on the finish."
US,95,65,Pinot Noir,red,Brittan Vineyards 2014 Cygnus Block Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"This new cuvée is sourced from a 2008 planting of the Swan clone, rare in Oregon. The aromatics are dazzling, with a lightly peppery, meaty aspect around slightly muted notes of herb and rock. The fruit is especially generous, with blackberry and boysenberry predominant. The wine is stylish, with cut and precision. Though truly exceptional, it needs your complete attention and some extra aeration to show its best."
US,91,22,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Zaca Mesa 2013 Z Cuvée Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"For one of their lower-priced bottlings, this blend of 55% Grenache, 40% Mourvèdre and 5% Cinsault is a great deal. The nose shows exuberant black raspberry, scarlet rose petals and fresh lilacs against a backdrop of dewy thyme and oregano. That herbal component carries strongly to the palate, giving nuance to tangy plum fruits. The savory touch would pair with everything from pasta to Asian-spiced beef."
US,86,35,Chardonnay,white,Stonehedge 2009 Chardonnay (Mendocino County),"The color of this very sweet wine is deep amber. Aromas are savory and rich, while flavors are unctuous and nutty. It's fun to drink, and tastes like a mature wine."
US,87,10,Merlot,red,Eliseo Silva 2007 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Soft and easy-drinking, this plum and cherry Merlot drinks like an older wine, as if it's been gently oxidized. It's probably at its peak, the fruit generous and round, the finish tailing off gently into a Milky Way sort of confection."
US,89,25,Merlot,red,Milbrandt 2006 The Estates Merlot (Wahluke Slope),"Dark, tannic and toasty, it's a rich mouthful of wine. The fruit is moderately ripe, with light berry flavors; but the toast and chocolate and coffee barrel flavors add a lot of weight and punch. Nice winemaking from Gordy Hill turns out a delicious wine."
US,89,60,Pinot Noir,red,Lemelson 2014 Jerome Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"All the Lemelson Pinots in 2014 are strikingly similar—rather light, tart, clean and simple. Cranberry and raspberry fruit, bright and tangy, tells the whole story here. Drink it over the next few years while that freshness remains."
US,91,45,Syrah,red,MCV 2014 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Extremely ripe and approachable on the nose, this lush bottling shows lots of barrel-derived scents, from caramel, vanilla, and pound cake to brown sugar and maple. It's soft and luscious with caramel-laced dessert qualities on the palate, certain to make a strong impression, albeit it with noticeable sweetness."
US,83,27,Zinfandel,red,Ben Hogan 2008 Tribute Series Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"A simple, jammy Zinfandel, with gentle raspberry, cherry, cola and spice flavors that finish sweet and hot in high alcohol."
US,88,20,Pinot Noir,red,Henry Estate 2015 Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"This is an elegant edition of the Henry Estate Pinot Noir. It has shed its rusticity in favor of a delicate expression of varietal character. Crushed rose petals, wild raspberries and a dash of pepper are backed with stiff tannins. Give it another year to fully come together."
France,86,13,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château la Roseraie 2014  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"Crisp and fruity, this is a wine full of red currant and blackberry flavors. It does have a tannic structure that will allow the wine to develop along with the acidity. In the family for three-generations, the estate is now run by Denis Hazane. Drink from 2018."
France,89,37,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château de Pressac 2014 Les Terrasses de Pressac  (Saint-Émilion),"From a Grand Cru estate, this second wine shows the same rich fruit and generous structure as the winery's first wine. It's just softer with an approachable character and generous black fruits that will enable it to mature relatively quickly. Drink from 2020."
US,88,25,Chardonnay,white,Dunham 2015 Shirley Mays Lewis Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Bright aromas of toast, spice and pear are followed by medium-bodied fruit flavors that persist on the finish."
US,91,28,Pinot Noir,red,Dobbes Family Estate 2014 Grand Assemblage Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"An outstanding value, the latest release of this wine dazzles with bold, black cherry and chocolate mocha flavors. The focus and definition throughout are exceptional also. This is a gem at a more than fair tariff."
US,89,55,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Andrew Will 2011 Two Blondes Vineyard Red (Yakima Valley),"In a cool vintage this site brings out more herbal components, here verging on flavors of green bean. But it pulls itself together with pretty berries, toasty oak, and a gentle streak of milk chocolate. The blend is 38% Merlot, 39% Cabernet Sauvignon and 23% Cabernet Franc."
US,89,19,Syrah,red,Abacela 2009 Syrah (Southern Oregon),"Forward, sappy and fruity, this has excellent structure and plenty of ripe berry flavor. It has supporting acids that lend a touch of citrus, plus a streak of vanilla that runs through the finish."
US,85,15,Syrah,red,Roza Ridge 2004 Syrah (Rattlesnake Hills),"Cherry soda, cherry candy; however you define it, this has a sweet cherry character. Light and fruity, it does offer some black pepper and loam character as well, elevating it above the level of simple soda pop wine."
France,93,70,Pinot Noir,red,Pehu-Simonet 2010 Fins Lieux No 1 Millésimé Grand Cru Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),"This single-parcel, partially barrel-fermented Champagne is in effect a Blanc de Noirs. If all that sounds complicated (and so does the name of the wine), the wine itself is much easier to appreciate. It is certainly rich, with a touch of tannin and mineral texture. Full of ripe white fruits, it offers good acidity at the end. It could age longer; drink from 2017."
US,91,42,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Owen Roe 2009 Red Red (Yakima Valley),"Three-fifths Merlot, one quarter Cab Franc and the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend shows ripe fruit scents of raisin and prune, offset with baking spices and plenty of chocolate and espresso. Full-throttle, smooth and concentrated, it's a big, concentrated, somewhat in-your face-effort, but delicious all the way through."
US,92,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Columbia Crest 2013 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas of dark coffee, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, and black cherry are still locked up but provide appeal. The flavors are textured and full, showing layers of dark fruit that undulate into the distance and display a fine sense of balance."
US,93,36,Red Blend,red,Rocky Hill 2007 Richard Dinner Vineyards Red (Sonoma Mountain),"An enormously rich wine, flamboyant in blackberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, sweet cured meat, anise and black pepper flavors that sink in deep and last long into the finish. An unusual blend of Malbec, Merlot and Syrah, it's powerful in tannins and bone dry. Grill up your best steak and enjoy."
Italy,88,65,Merlot,red,Petra 2012 Quercegobbe Merlot (Toscana),"Red currant, vanilla, toasted oak, coffee and chocolate aromas lead the nose and follow through to the dense, full-bodied palate. It's one-dimensional but muscular, with ample, velvety tannins."
US,85,49,Pinot Noir,red,Roadhouse Winery 2012 White Label Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"Clear and light in color and texture, this offers an inviting floral and citrus bouquet, while the palate flirts with Asian five-spice and black cherry. While the fruit is compelling, the structure is undefined and the finish a tad flat."
US,90,35,Pinot Noir,red,Ousterhout 2015 800 Vines Vineyard Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"From a site in Green Valley, this crisp, light-bodied offering has a dusty rose aroma and a meaty consistency the provides body without weight. Cranberry and cherry notes form its fruit core, accompanied by a tease of grapefruit."
France,87,29,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Grand Enclos du Château de Cérons 2005  Cérons,"Cérons, next door to Sauternes, produces a lighter version of those dessert wines. This wine, with its characteristic honey sweetness, is edging toward toffee, the baked apple flavors already tamed by a few years aging. The core of botrytis dryness is now well integrated, suggesting the wine is ready to drink."
US,85,28,Pinot Noir,red,Cosa Obra 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"There's a funkiness to this full-bodied wine, from undetermined provenance within the county. Thick in black cherry, it's straightforward and not fussy."
France,93,24,Riesling,white,Boeckel 2014 Brandluft Riesling (Alsace),"Subdued, riper fruit has not yet come to the surface. Notions of Bramley apple are evoked on the nose; on the palate they show as the more rounded flavor of baked Bramley. Hovering above it all is grated lemon zest, pulling fruit, texture and freshness tautly together in a dry, fresh yet mellow finish. The more you taste, the more the still-underlying fruit yearns to rise to the surface. Best to give this some time so it can show its true, exciting colours."
US,88,29,Chardonnay,white,Dusted Valley 2013 Chardonnay (Yakima Valley),"Aromas of pear, melted butter and toasty spice lead to a lightly creamy, elegantly styled palate with lingering stone-fruit flavors. It seems faint but what's there shows a fine sense of balance."
US,87,49,Pinot Noir,red,Johan 2012 Three Barrel Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"As the name indicates, this limited reserve is a selection of the winemaker's best barrels. It was fermented with 90% whole clusters, and aged 15 months in one-third new French oak. There are ample scents and flavors of stem, leaf and root, which dominate. Give this wine a lot of breathing time or a vigorous decant, which will help to bring the fruit back up."
US,85,13,Merlot,red,Hyatt 2011 Merlot (Rattlesnake Hills),"Hailing from the cool 2011 vintage, it's light in style with notes of red currant, herbs and olive with little apparent oak influence. A straight-forward easy quaffer."
US,92,45,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Chalk Hill 2015 Musque Sauvignon Blanc (Chalk Hill),"Fresh and vibrantly floral on the nose and palate, this lovely white from the musqué clone imparts full-bodied, voluptuous layers of pineapple and grapefruit rind, lingering long on the finish."
France,85,10,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Barton & Guestier 2006  Bordeaux,"Black currants and spice provide the backbone to this classic Bordeaux red. There are dry tannins, some attractive smoky flavors, topped with acidity and a final, lightly wooded close."
France,91,25,Riesling,white,Boeckel 2015 Brandluft Riesling (Alsace),"Slenderness and light touch are apparent with the first sniff of fresh citrus blossom. The palate of this wine shows the full fruit of 2015 with pear, peach, orange and apple shimmering through. The soft, bouncy palate is super-clean, fresh and dry."
US,93,52,Pinot Noir,red,Siduri 2014 Parsons' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"From a site on the edges of Santa Rosa, this vineyard-designate shows a wealth of baked strawberry and is noteworthy for its vibrantly fruity aromatics. Ripe, velvety and lush on the palate, it delivers sensually and deliciously, with a lasting imprint of cola spice on the finish."
US,90,24,Riesling,white,V. Sattui 2014 Off-Dry Riesling (Napa Valley),"A medium-sweet wine with 2.19% residual sugar, this has a sweetness like ripe white peach topped by a honeysuckle rose, but it remains light and never cloying. The nutty finish begs for blue cheese."
US,85,18,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Kirkland Signature 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"Aromas of plum, herbs and confection come along with barnyard notes that jut out. The fruit flavors are dry and chalky with medicinal notes taking over. Drink now."
US,87,37,Zinfandel,red,Pech Merle 2014 Treborce Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Blended with 8% Petite Sirah and aged less than a year in French and American oak, this wine is simple, with compostable earth scents and soft, round layers of brambly blackberry fruit."
US,90,48,Chardonnay,white,Saintsbury 2015 Sangiacomo Green Acres Dijon Clone 809 Chardonnay (Carneros),"Golden hay in color, this clonal exploration imparts light-bodied peach, graham cracker and orange flavors, the latter showing prominently on the nose. Bright acidity keeps it youthfully refreshing, with both body and weight in balance."
France,85,10,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Bellevue 2014  Bordeaux,"A light and fruity wine that has bright black fruits and an edge of tannins. The black currant and acidity give the wine its fruity character, typical of the vintage. Drink now."
US,92,25,Zinfandel,red,Miro 2007 80 Year Old Vines Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"This is a ripe, lusty Zinfandel, with many special qualities to recommend it. It's dry and rich in smooth tannins, and offers a flood of wild forest berry, sweet new leather, red currant, mocha and exotic Asian spice flavors. Delicious, and will hold for up to six years."
France,86,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Joseph Mellot 2012 La Gravelière  (Sancerre),"Ripe and creamy wine, with some herbaceousness and yellow fruits. Layering citrus and a tangy texture, it's fruity, full of lively acidity and ready to drink this year. Screwcap."
Italy,87,13,Pinot Noir,red,Natale Verga 2008 Nuarè Pinot Noir (Delle Venezie),Nuarè is a bright and cheerful Pinot Noir with fruit sourced from northern Italy that shows pretty nuances of forest berry and blue flower. The mouthfeel is lean and compact but the low price is one of this wine's biggest selling points.
US,92,29,Riesling,white,Hermann J. Wiemer 2014 Reserve Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake),"Seeming delicate at first, barely-there whiffs of lemon peel and green herb turn riper and sunnier on this dry, medium-bodied Riesling. The palate is quite unctuous, dripping with white peach and grapefruit nectar. A cool strike of steel extends from midpalate to finish, lending mineral elegance to this ripe, rich wine."
US,90,35,Chardonnay,white,Ken Brown 2008 Nielson Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Produced from this famous cool-climate vineyard, the wine is zesty in acidity and dry, but enormously rich and impressive in pineapple and pear flavors, with a distinct minerality that makes it feel drier and earthier. It's a strong wine, but subtle. Drink now, but not too cold."
US,89,28,Chardonnay,white,Chamisal Vineyards 2014 Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"Jasmine, honeysuckle and gardenia aromas show on the nose of this bottling, which also offers peach custard and ripe grapefruit skin scents. The palate is welcoming and very familiar, with butter, sea salt, lemon and ambrosia melon flavors, all framed by solid acidity."
US,90,36,Syrah,red,Margerum 2008 Colson Canyon Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"It's hard to resist the charms of this delicious Syrah. It has brisk acids and tannins, yet it's curiously soft on the palate, with rich, exotically sweet flavors of black currants, dark chocolate, bacon and plum sauce."
US,88,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cass 2010 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"This densely concentrated wine is intense with blackberry and black currant flavors. The tannins are strong but very finely textured, giving the wine a velvety mouthfeel. It finishes with sweet oak notes and a warmth from alcohol that barbecue will easily handle."
US,89,28,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Blue Valley 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Middleburg),"This wine is alive with herbacious notes that give it a savory quality—cut grass and green olive blend effortlessly with rosewater and baked lemon. These are all well represented on the palate, which also offers a welcome green apple flavor. Good acidity and balanced weight offer a long and lifted finish, complex with character."
US,92,96,Pinot Noir,red,Merry Edwards 2013 40th Anniversary Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A special bottling commemorating Edwards' 40 years as a winemaker, this wine is made from a clonal selection created by her in 1975. The fruit is from both the Coopersmith and Georganne vineyards, made in a tiny amount. Built to age, it wraps earthy dried herbs around cherry, strawberry and boysenberry, with a juicy core of acidity. A forested hint of spearmint dances at its edge, as strong suggestions of bacon and pepper build on the finish. Drink now through 2028."
US,85,30,Chardonnay,white,Cinnabar 2008 Skyland Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"A ponderous Chardonnay, marked by excessive new oak flavors and the heavy hand of the winemaker. Shows pineapple, pear and tangerine flavors, but the barrel and malolactic additions soften and sweeten them."
US,87,80,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,St. Clement 2005 Star Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A bit earthy. One hundred percent new oak dominates the jammy black cherry, violet and herb flavors. Feels somewhat tired, even though it's only three-plus years old."
France,89,35,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Domaine de la Tour du Bon 2010 Red (Bandol),"This wine introduces itself with intense acidity and freshness, opening the palate to red berry flavors and tannins that are integrating well. It's a wine for medium-term aging. Drink from 2015."
Italy,92,55,Sangiovese,red,Castello Romitorio 1997  Brunello di Montalcino,"Sandro Chia's winery is known not only for its reliable and enjoyable wines, but also for the art series labels—work from his New York and Montalcino studios—for each vintage. In 1997, the estate has produced an intense wine, skillfully managing the sweet wood and rich, dark and concentrated fruit. The wine will age well—coming to maturity in 10 years or more—but will surely be drinkable in five."
US,92,63,Pinot Noir,red,Martinelli 2012 Three Sisters Vineyard Sea Ridge Meadow Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A light, clear color suggests a lighthearted wine, but this coastal vineyard-designate delivers plenty of power around a core of damp, earthy wild strawberry and blackberry. Soft, with managed and integrated tannins, it's relatively high in acidity and is well structured, with a pleasant jamminess and aromas of freshly cut rose."
France,88,20,Chardonnay,white,Vins Auvigue 2015  Saint-Véran,"This is a full and creamy wine. The richness is happily cut with citrus and apple acidity to give a crisp edge and tang to the ripe yellow fruit. It finishes with a lively, bright aftertaste."
US,90,24,Chardonnay,white,Navarro 2006 Premier Reserve Chardonnay (Anderson Valley),"Very rich and honeyed, a powerhouse Chard oozing with pineapple jam, crème brûlée, and coconut candy flavors. For all its sweet mouthfeel, the wine is dry and crisp in brilliant acidity."
Italy,87,15,Red Blend,red,Fattoria di Grignano 2012  Chianti Rufina,"This blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Can aiolo and 5% other red grapes opens with aromas of ripe dark-skinned fruit, crushed blue flowers and a whiff of clove. The easygoing palate offers dried black cherry, espresso and a hint of anise alongside dusty tannins."
Italy,87,15,White Blend,white,Argillae 2015  Orvieto,"This luminous white opens with aromas of honeysuckle, tropical fruit and a whiff of tomato leaf. The racy palate offers grapefruit, bitter almond and a mineral note alongside lively acidity."
France,90,32,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine François Schmitt NV Blanc de Noirs Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace),"Notions of ripe, yellow apple peel signals that this is a more rounded, slightly more oxidative style, boasting a bready, autolytic backbone. With its rounded yet fresh character, this would make an ideal winter apéritif. Savor the beautiful oatmeal finish."
US,83,50,Pinot Noir,red,Loring Wine Company 2007 Aubaine Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"Heavy and dull, like cherry pie filling, dusted with cinnamon and cocoa, without the pie shell. That baked crust provides the crunchy structure, which this fruit bomb lacks."
US,91,42,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,La Honda Winery 2012 Lonehawk Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Deep strawberry, blackberry, black olive and oregano show on the nose of this bottling that comes from a vineyard 1,100 feet above the town of Saratoga. The 100% American oak treatment makes for a savory sip, with bay leaf, white pepper, cracked peppercorn and olive, all bone dry and mouth-drying in tannins."
US,84,18,Merlot,red,Desert Wind 2010 Desert Wind Vineyard Merlot (Wahluke Slope),"One hundred percent varietal, this vineyard designated Merlot seems a casualty of the cool 2010 growing season with prominent herbal notes, tart plum flavors, and astringent tannins."
US,91,17,Sauvignon Blanc,white,RouteStock 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"A consistently great white, this vintage is as impressive as ever, exhibiting steely, rocky minerality around savory, smooth layers marked by light, pretty flavors of key lime and lemon peel."
US,97,110,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Signorello 2005 Padrone Proprietary Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"Marks a welcome return to the magnificence of the 2002, although more recent vintages haven't exactly been slouches. The '05 is amazing, a densely structured, deeply flavored Bordeaux blend that's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. Shows classic notes of cassis, currants and black cherry liqueur, while 70% new oak adds enticingly rich layers of sweet toast and smoky vanilla. The tannins are pure, classic Napa, very refined and ripe, offering solid structural support with no trace of astringency. Beautiful now, and should slowly develop for many years."
US,93,85,Pinot Noir,red,Hirsch 2014 Block 8 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Maybe the friendliest Hirsch bottling, this wine has wonderful complexity, medium body and a broad supple texture that make it a pleasure to taste. It has spicy lightly earthy aromas, plenty of raspberry, red cherry and rhubarb for fruit flavors, and a good sense of layering on the palate, followed by a long finish."
US,91,32,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Brooklyn Winery 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Elegant and in balance, despite its powerful mix of ripeness and tension, this wine offers cranberry, thyme, oregano, graphite and tar. All combine for a savory succulence of intrigue and deliciousness, finishing in a length of black pepper."
US,90,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Louis M. Martini 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"It's really easy to like now for its rich black currant, cherry and chocolate flavors. The tannins are firm and ripe, and there's a lovely balance of acidity and oak. This is one of the best Martini Alexander Valley Cabs to date."
US,85,25,Zinfandel,red,Truchard 2008 Zinfandel (Carneros),"As candied as a granola health bar, this Zin has flavors of sugared blackberries, roasted almonds, caramel and chocolate. If you like your Zins a little sweet, it's for you."
US,82,16,Zinfandel,red,Bella Vigna 1998 Costa Vineyard Zinfandel (Lodi),"Smells like a shootout in a tomato factory. It's a strong whiff of tomatoes on the vine, followed by tannin and a little sweet, grapy fruit."
US,89,38,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Mark Ryan 2012 Numbskull BDX Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This appealing blend of Merlot (69%), Cabernet Sauvignon (28%) and Petit Verdot conveys dark roasted coffee along with red and black fruit with barrel accents. Abundant vanilla and coffee flavors partner with grippy tannins that need more time in the bottle to settle in."
US,91,18,Chardonnay,white,Taken Wine Co. 2013 Complicated Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"This is a delicious Chardonay. It dances in pear, peach and lemon notes. Balanced and addictive, it's easy to love and not overly complicated at all. Encased in just enough oak to provide texture and weight, this is a great wine for parties or casual dinners, pairable with just about anything."
US,94,55,Syrah,red,Betz Family 2008 La Côte Rousse Syrah (Red Mountain),"This Red Mountain Syrah spent a year in French oak, half new, half once-used. The fruit is wrapped in smoke and coffee, graphite and mineral scents and flavors. Crystal clear and densely packed, this shows none of the funk common in many Washington Syrahs, but an almost claret-like structure and grip. It should age well for a decade or longer."
US,93,200,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,JCB 2012 No. 1 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This hedonistically powerful mix of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot traffics in blackberry and black cherry jam over a layer of soft tannins. Coffee, toffee and subtle Asian and cinnamon spice keep the proceedings lively, for this is a seriously ripe and playful wine. Cellar through 2020."
US,94,55,Chardonnay,white,Joseph Phelps 2012 Freestone Vineyards Estate Grown Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Made from estate-grown fruit near the chilly Sonoma Coast town of Freestone, this is a fully layered wine, expertly balanced in acidity yet offering plenty of full-figured mouthfeel and viscous pleasure. It delivers an electric mix of Meyer lemon, minerals and brioche, and will please a diverse range of palates."
US,84,25,Pinot Noir,red,Galante 2005 Almond Flat Pinot Noir (Carmel Valley),"Tastes harsh and a little stemmy, although you'll find Pinot's silky texture and nice flavors of cherries, red currants and cedar. Drink now."
US,85,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,St. Francis 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"Grassy in style, this ripe, viscous white provides good value, bright and bittersweet in passionfruit and pineapple. Viscous, it ends full-figured."
Italy,86,13,Red Blend,red,Tommasi 2012 Masseria Surani Ares Red (Puglia),"This easy blend of Primitivo, Negroamaro and Cabernet Sauvignon opens with fruity aromas of dark berry and a whiff of tobacco.

US,88,27,Pinot Noir,red,Chehalem 2010 Three Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This smoky, dusty wine seems to be chugging quickly along the aging curve.

This wine has shown a great improvement over the years it has been produced."
US,86,28,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hess 2007 Allomi Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Here's a gutsy, fruity Cabernet. It fills the mouth with juicy raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors and hints of chocolate. Nothing subtle, just a dry, rich red wine for drinking now."
US,87,39,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Carneros 2014 Estate Pinot Noir (Carneros),"From several of the producer's estate vineyards, this wine traffics in spicy, leathery texture and robust full-bodied power, layering in more tart savory characteristics of rhubarb, dark cherry and orange. The tannins are firm and supportive, taking on a velvety sheen."
France,87,15,Merlot,red,Château de Garros 2015  Bordeaux Supérieur,This Jean-Pierre and Philippe Rivière label benefits from the ripeness of the vintage to bring out red plum and a rich structure. The acidity and tannins perfectly emphasize the generous fruitiness. Drink from 2018.
US,83,23,Red Blend,red,Minassian-Young 2007 Black St. Peter Red (Paso Robles),"Soft and melted in fruit, with high alcohol that gives it a burn, this Zinfandel and Mourvèdre-based blend has raspberry, cola and spice flavors. Drink now with spicy burgers, ribs, roast pork."
US,88,6,Riesling,white,Ste. Chapelle 2001 Dry Riesling (Idaho),"Riesling has always been a strength of this winery, and this wine clearly shows why. It has a lightness and delicacy missing from most other domestic Riesling, yet it is not simple. Its complex, subtle, food-friendly flavors are right on the money. Best Buy. —P.G."
US,84,20,Chardonnay,white,Starmont 2008 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Too sweet and oaky, with sugary vanilla and pineapple jam flavors. Could be a Starbucks drink. Saved a bit by crisp acidity."
US,88,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Evolve 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley),"A clean, brisk Sauvignon Blanc with lots of complex interest. It's dry, but rich in citrus, tropical fruit and honeysuckle flavors, with a tantalizing hint of gooseberry."
US,92,68,Pinot Noir,red,Bergström 2014 Le Pré du Col Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"In French, the vineyard name means “the meadow on the mountain,” a fitting name for the site. This is a spicy wine, with a touch of red-hot candy. The pretty cherry fruit is underscored with earth and mineral, and the astringent, tea-flavored tannins morph into a suggestion of cola at the tail end."
US,88,29,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Beltane Ranch 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley),"Creamy vanilla and pear give this white a decadent edge, brought back to earth by its integrated acidity. The use of oak is not overdone and there's body and structure to spare, along with tropical-leaning flavors of papaya and pineapple."
US,83,10,Chardonnay,white,Harlow Ridge 2010 Chardonnay (Lodi),"Direct and fruity, this Chardonnay is loaded with lemon."
US,89,48,Pinot Noir,red,Yamhill Valley 1998 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Smells young, fresh, and oaky, with flamboyant black-cherry fruit as well as roasted coffeebean and oriental spices. Very rich and extracted, with dry-cherry fruit and a creamy texture. It's a bit hard now with tannins, so give it a few years, or drink it sooner with duck or lamb."
US,86,20,Chardonnay,white,Icaria 2012 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"A fairly standard Chardonnay, rich in oak, lees and ripe citrus and tropical fruit flavors, but raised up by brisk acidity and a fine minerality that gives it extra complexity. It's rich with honey and brown sugar, but doesn't feel cloying."
US,92,48,Pinot Noir,red,Iris Vineyards 2015 La Cantera Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This fascinating, distinctive wine has a frame of grapefruity citrus around peppery pomegranates. It's well knit, textural, and finishes with more citrus rind phenolics. It's sleek and polished, though not a opulently fruity as the listed alcohol might suggest."
France,87,27,Pinot Gris,white,Dopff & Irion 2005 Domaines du Château de Riquewihr Les Maquisards Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Done in a clean and fresh style, this Pinot Gris has nice depth of flavor, with plenty of apricot and pear interest in the mouth. The fruit here is very healthy and the impression totally dry. Hazelnuts and just a touch of minerality linger on the finish."
US,90,65,Syrah,red,Ross Andrew 2010 Old Block Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine provides aromas of iron, red currant, cranberry and herb, along with a rubbing alcohol note that provides a bit of distraction. It's reserved but flavorful, with fruit and savory notes lingering on the tart, extended finish."
US,89,30,White Blend,white,Andis 2016 Cuvée Blanc White (Amador County),"Light, fresh and fruity without being at all sweet or soft, this is a charming dry wine to serve with lunch or at wine o'clock in the afternoon. It smell like freshly cut apples and Bosc pears, tastes crisp and feels tangy and palate cleansing."

France,84,20,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château de Callac 2013 Prestige  (Graves),"This is a totally herbaceous wine with no messing around. It has fresh acidity, crisp green fruitiness and lively acidity. Just a touch of wood gives a more sophisticated edge. Drink from 2016."
France,86,15,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Lauduc 2016  Bordeaux Blanc,"This wine is soft and rounded. It does have plenty of acidity but that is only a part of a ripe, smooth whole. The lemon fruitiness and touch of spice give the aftertaste a great lift."
France,88,28,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Haut-Gelineau 2012  Côtes de Bourg,"Ripe, ready to drink and fruity, this is an attractive, balanced wine. Black-currant flavors are given structure by the tannins in this 94% Merlot and 6% Cabernet Franc blend from 15 acres. The fresh acidity of the vintage is still there, giving a lively juicy aftertaste. Drink now. An Alliance Bourg member."
US,91,27,Riesling,white,Smith-Madrone 2011 Riesling (Spring Mountain District),"Classic Smith-Madrone Riesling, this is dryish and clean, with mouthwatering acidity and hints of citrus, Asian pear, green apple and honey. It shows balance and elegance that is rare in California Riesling. Enjoyable now, and it should slowly develop nuances over the next eight years."
US,88,20,Chardonnay,white,Swiftwater Cellars 2013 Zephyr Ridge Chardonnay (Horse Heaven Hills),"Aromas of melted caramel, barrel spices, kiwi and pineapple rise up from this wine. The fruit flavors are lighter in style and lead to a warm finish with abundant fig notes that linger."
Italy,95,80,Sangiovese,red,Il Marroneto 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,"Forest floor, wild berry, new leather and balsam are some of the aromas you'll find in this bright, linear red. On the palate, firm, polished tannins support ripe red cherry, white pepper, andcrushed mint notes with a hint of black tea. It's still young and tightly wound but already boasts stunning elegance. Drink 2020–2032."
US,85,16,Zinfandel,red,Cline 2007 Ancient Vines Zinfandel (California),"Rich in spicy, briary berry-cherry and chocolate fruit, with ultra-smooth tannins, and just enough acidity to cut through barbecue sauce. It's a bit sweet and Porty on its own."
US,87,12,Pinot Noir,red,McManis 2015 Pinot Noir (California),"This is a generously fruity wine with light oak aromas, lots of straightforward black-cherry flavor, a smooth texture and full body."
France,90,39,Syrah,red,Éric & Jöel Durand 2010 Les Coteaux  (Saint-Joseph),"The brothers are better known for their Cornas, but this Saint-Joseph is a nice wine as well. It combines notes of marinated beef, ripe blackberries and espresso in a medium- to full-bodied wine that's mouthwatering and easy to drink. Try it now and over the next several years."
France,85,11,Red Blend,red,Château Lecusse 2009 Grappes d'Or Red (Gaillac),"A classic Gaillac blend of Duras, Gamay, Merlot and Syrah, this is a bright, fruity wine, the lighter of the two wines produced at Château Lecusse. Red berries dominate, allied to crisp acidity."
US,91,36,Red Blend,red,Kontos 2011 Alatus Blend Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Principally Cabernet Sauvignon, this also holds with Merlot, Malbec and Syrah. The coolness of the vintage shows through with aromas of dried and fresh savory herbs along with coffee, licorice and dark fruit. The palate is equal parts elegant and flavorful, with supple fruit notes that glide."
US,88,30,Pinot Noir,red,Spicy Vines 2016 Nouveau Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This small-production, nouveau-style wine was made without oak or filtering. Simple and juicy, it's festive, with effusive dried cranberry and cola spice notes that are soft and easygoing."
France,93,27,Riesling,white,Domaine Charles Baur 2010 Brand Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),The sand and granite soil of the Brand vineyard gives an intensely structured wine that's tight and steely. It's rich with apricot and pear flavors made crisp with refreshing acidity. Drink from 2015.
US,94,125,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Carte Blanche 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is the very definition of a modern cult-style Napa Cabernet. It's extraordinarily rich and flavorful in blackberries, blueberries, cassis and chocolate, while the jacket of tannins is as soft and velvety as modern winemaking can achieve. It doesn't seem likely to age beyond 2015."
US,94,70,Merlot,red,Duckhorn 2003 Merlot (Howell Mountain),"Those notorious mountain tannins have largely melted, making the wine drinkable now, although it will hold for a decade with proper cellaring. Lush and velvety, with a drop of Cabernet Franc, this is voluptuous in cherries, black currants and fine, toasty oak."
US,88,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cloudlift Cellars 2014 Halcyon Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A good chunk of this wine comes from old-vine plantings at Bacchus Vineyard. Herb, barrel spice and mocha aromas lead to reserved cherry flavors, backed by lightly grainy tannins, with mocha flavors on the finish."
US,91,37,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,DeLille 2012 Chaleur Estate Blanc White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Modeled on a white Bordeaux, this is a lovely, lightly toasty blend of two-thirds Sauvignon Blanc and one-third Sémillon. The pretty fruit mixes candied lemon, peach and pear with streaks of butterscotch and a suggestion of hazelnuts."
Italy,88,23,Sangiovese,red,Banfi 2012  Rosso di Montalcino,"Fragrant and fresh, this opens with aromas of violets, perfumed berries and black spices. The juicy palate delivers dark cherry, crushed raspberry and cinnamon alongside supple tannins. Its easygoing nature makes it perfect for everyday enjoyment."
France,85,30,Chardonnay,white,Christophe Cordier 2013 Vieilles Vignes  (Mâcon),"Fresh fruit with apple acidity gives this wine a ready-to-drink character. It has an attractive lift of citrus and a light, crisp and fresh aftertaste."
US,92,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,V. Sattui 2009 Preston Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a fleshy Cabernet, with meaty, olive notes to the blackberries and black currants. It's nicely dry and tannic, the kind of Cab that needs a rich steak to tame the astringency. Should develop over the next 5–6 years, at least."
France,92,70,Chardonnay,white,Simonnet-Febvre 2007 Preuses Grand Cru  (Chablis),"The style is full in the mouth, showing vanilla as well as soft peach fruits. Finishing richly, this is not a Grand Cru for aging, but it does wear its ripe fruit easily with a good burst of steely acidity."
US,84,15,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Spellbound 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"This Cab is pretty good for the price. It's ripe and fruity, with a full body and rich but soft tannins. Turns a bit treacly on the finish, with a dulcet, honeyed richness."
France,87,14,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Tour le Pin 2015  Bordeaux Blanc,"This is an attractive blend that includes a good proportion of ripe Sémillon and perfumed Muscadelle. They soften and deliciously fill out the herbal edge of the wine. That gives it a rich feel, full and fruity with a fragrant aftertaste. Drink now."
US,87,20,Pinot Noir,red,Barra 2012 Pinot Noir (Mendocino),"Smooth in texture and layered in flavor, this is well-balanced. The color is not too dark and the aromas and flavors recall red cherries and flowers. Mild tannins and fresh acidity help hold everything together."
Italy,90,75,Red Blend,red,Poggio Scalette 2013 Capogatto Red (Alta Valle della Greve),"A blend of equal parts Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of French oak, blueberry and chopped Mediterranean herb. The soft, medium-bodied palate offers juicy black cherry, cassis, coffee and a hint of mint alongside round, polished tannins."
US,90,30,Zinfandel,red,Rodney Strong 2014 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This wine's restrained aromas take time to come around, showing a mix of dust and black pepper before waves of juicy red fruit and soft tannin and oak mingle together seamlessly on the palate. Toasted oak and vanilla notes mark the long finish."
France,93,48,Riesling,white,Domaine Zinck 2010 Eichberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"With the first hints of maturity on the nose, this is already a rounded and steely wine. The fruit shows as spiced apples and black currants, cut with intense citrus. But the fruit is giving way to a very precise, crisp and nervy wine that could still age further. For its best, drink from 2018."
US,91,32,Syrah,red,Saviah 2008 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Sourced from the new estate vineyard, this impressive young Syrah is compact and powerful. Scents of cinnamon, salted chocolate and black tea enhance the dark fruit flavors. Brandied cherries, smoke and earth streak on through a wine that seems to have a good decade of life ahead."
France,86,39,White Blend,white,Domaines Ott 2008 Clos Mireille Blanc de Blancs White (Côtes de Provence),"The nose is fresh and pretty and there's definitely a luxurious texture to the flower-accented palate. However, it lacks intensity in the mouth and a slight funkiness on the finish detracts. Drink soon."
US,88,40,Pinot Noir,red,Masút 2013 Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino),"Cherry pie and cinnamon dominate the aromas. Sweet oaky influences like baking spices and brown sugar come out in the flavors, as a lush texture soothes the palate. This tastes mild in terms of acidity and tannins so it comes off as soft and almost sweet."
Italy,86,14,Red Blend,red,Montecappone 2012  Rosso Piceno,"This blend of 70% Montepulciano and 30% Sangiovese opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, underbrush and ripe black fruit. Ripe black cherry and raspberry flavors are layered with chocolate and espresso, alongside rough, drying tannins."
France,90,22,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Château la Genestière 2014 Red (Lirac),"A traditional blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre, this is a silky, medium-bodied wine. Cinnamon and cedar shadings frame bright cherry fruit and linger through the elegant finish. Drink now–2019."
Italy,90,59,Sangiovese,red,Cerbaia 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,"This opens with aromas of ripe berry, cake spice, leather and blue flower. The juicy medium-bodied palate offers black plum, wild cherry, coffee and star anise framed in chewy rounded tannins."
US,92,28,Merlot,red,Stevens 2005 Merlot (Yakima Valley),"Winemaker Tim Stevens' dark, subtle, beautifully proportioned wines glide across the palate like Apollo Ono dancing with the stars. The cool site brings out some of the floral and citrus accents often missing from Merlot, and the darker cherry and plum fruit flavors fill in right behind. Supple and sensuous, this is a wine to savor and, if possible, cellar for another decade."
France,92,122,Chardonnay,white,Olivier Leflaive 2012 Poruzots Premier Cru  (Meursault),"At this stage, this is a wood-dominated wine. Its potential is considerable because beneath this wood and toast awaits a wonderful range of ripe apples, apricots and mango that promise to develop into a full, generous wine. Keep until 2018."
Italy,83,11,Sangiovese,red,Badia di Morrona 1998 I Sodi del Paretaio  (Chianti),"There's some interesting game and slate accents on the nose here, but also a candied quality to the cherry fruit. The acidity is fairly high and the tannins tense and somewhat drying on the finish."
US,94,60,Pinot Noir,red,Bergström 2013 Le Pré du Col Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"Grapes from this tiny AVA frequently deliver that something extra that catapults Pinot into a higher dimension. Here, solid cherry and berry tones bear almost indefinable traces of iron, mineral and sweet hay. Delicious already, this should continue to improve through 2020."
US,90,62,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Justin 2007 Isoceles Red (Paso Robles),"Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this wine is exuberantly rich and sweet in ripe blackberry, black cherry and chocolate fruit. Smoky oak plays a crucial role, in both flavors and texture. It's a very pretty, polished wine, elegant and balanced and ready to drink now. Production was a hefty 11,000 cases."
US,87,25,Riesling,white,Stoller 2012 Estate Exclusive Riesling (Dundee Hills),"Despite the low alcohol, this is quite dry and tart, with a lemony base and some orange-pekoe flavors also. Not a complex Riesling, but light and pleasantly sippable."
US,91,42,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Efeste 2005 Big Papa Old Vine Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"It's pure Cabernet Sauvignon, dense, dark and what might be called brooding. Despite the massive fruit, the darker notes of black olive and earth are not submerged in sweetness. In fact, there are Stag's Leap-like flavors of rock and mineral. Along with the sleek cassis and black cherry, come highlights of bitter chocolate."
US,87,45,Pinot Noir,red,J Wrigley 2011 Proposal Block Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"The first vintage from this estate vineyard, this is quite light, especially as the 2011 vintage was cool. It shows the delicate structure at which Pinot Noir excels. It's aromatic and varietal, very well made, and a good bottle for any roasted small bird such as squab or quail."
France,85,18,Chardonnay,white,Simonnet-Febvre 2012 Chitry  (Chablis),"An attractive wine from Chitry, south-west of Chablis, this is fresh, soft and fruity. It lacks complexity, but does have bright apple and pear flavors and refreshing acidity. It's a great apéritif wine, ready to drink now."
US,89,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Gainey 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"The nose on this wine from the longtime Santa Ynez Valley producer is a bit faint, with wet lawn and lemon most apparent. The palate is more sensation-based than flavor-driven, all about light texture and simmering acidity, with green apple and lime skin elements."
US,87,30,Red Blend,red,Telaya 2011 Turas Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Half Syrah with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, it brings sweet barrel notes of vanilla and coconut along with dried cherry and blueberry. The palate is light to medium bodied with an interplay of chocolate and cherry flavors that keeps things interesting even as the concentration dips."
Italy,94,80,Red Blend,red,Michele Satta 2003 I Castagni  (Bolgheri Superiore),"This is made from a curious 70-20-10 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Teroldego (an indigenous grape of northern Italy). The results include black currant, lead pencil, green spice, natural rubber, smoked bacon and lingering blueberry. With its thick, chewy succulence, jackhammer tannins and amazing length, it will hold 20 years."
US,84,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Charles Krug 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Good varietal flavors of citrus fruits, wildflowers, gooseberries and vanilla in this wine, along with crisp acidity. On the downside is too much sugary sweetness, which makes it cloying."
France,93,50,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Rossignol-Trapet 2011 Les Teurons Premier Cru  (Beaune),"This is a soft wine on the surface, but under that generosity lies a firm core that gives the promise of aging. This powerful wine comes from stony soil which explains the tannic structure while the richness comes from ripe berry fruits. Drink from 2017."
US,88,14,Chardonnay,white,Knapp 2011 Barrel Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Our first taste of the 2011 Chards from the Finger Lakes, Knapp's Barrel Reserve is wonderfully crisp and refreshing with an abundance of fresh pear and lemon flavor. Subtly oaked with just a hint of vanilla and cream that lingers on the palate. Drink now."
US,90,32,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Page Mill Winery 2014 GPS Red (Livermore Valley),"Deep color and complex aromas like dark chocolate and cedar lead to ripe, concentrated and tastefully dry berry and cherry flavors in this Rhône-style blend. The mouthfeel is firm with tannins but polished."
US,88,55,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Benziger 2010 Oonapais Red (Sonoma Valley),"Softly tannic, this Bordeaux blend features layers of mocha, blackberries, prunes and sweet oak. It's a rich wine to drink now. Try with a beef stew accented with fruit."
US,85,40,Pinot Noir,red,Peter Paul Wines 2009 Mill Station Road Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A bit stemmy, also a little underripe, with some minty, vegetal notes marring otherwise fine raspberries and cherries. Drink now."
US,90,34,Syrah,red,Tertulia 2012 Riviere Galets Estate Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"In this intriguing wine blended with 10% Grenache, the aromas, flavors and feel aren't entirely connected. It's aromatically very reserved, with notes of mineral, coffee and red fruit. It has a incredibly supple, dazzling texture with the throttle pulled back on the alcohol and extraction."
US,86,28,Chardonnay,white,Anaba 2009 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Sweet and extracted in pineapple, tangerine, lime and vanilla flavors, this Chardonnay also is generously oaked, which gives it even richer vanilla and buttered toast notes. It's flashy, yet would benefit from greater dryness and restraint. Size isn't everything."
US,93,38,Syrah,red,Frequency 2015 Watch Hill Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Black currant, lavender, black pepper, soy and graphite show on the nose of this bottling by Zac Wasserman, an assistant to Joey Tensley. There is a flash of lavender at the tip of the sip, and then the darkness descends, with charred meats and blackened berries cut by a strong acidity. It still needs time to develop, but these wines disappear fast, so stock up."
US,88,32,Pinot Noir,red,Spindrift Cellars 2012 Barrel Select Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The Barrel Select offers a bit more concentration than the winery's regular Pinot, with meatier tannins and highlights of spice and coffee grounds. It's soundly made and already drinks well in a forward, accessible style."
US,90,22,Riesling,white,Boundary Breaks 2011 No. 239 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Boundary Breaks is an exciting new project from the Finger Lakes, and the No. 239 is one of its best. While ebulliently fruity, almost tropical, on the nose, it's elegantly dry on the palate with a rich, creamy palate full of ripe grapefruit and peach flavors. Vibrant lemon-lime acidity, it finishes long with a hint of lime-skin pith."
US,85,14,Pinot Noir,red,Castle Rock 2010 Pinot Noir (Monterey County),"Zesty Monterey acidity gives life to this Pinot and lifts it above being a mere candy bar. Yes, it's sweetish and direct in cherries, raspberries and cola, but that tang makes it easy to enjoy."
US,87,30,Zinfandel,red,Rock Wall 2013 Harris Kratka Vineyard Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"Chocolate graham cracker and a Port-like aroma of ripeness dominate in this wine, which adds in Carignane and Petite Sirah. Good acidity and a softness of texture complete the picture."
Italy,89,50,Sangiovese,red,Il Molino di Grace 2012 Il Margone Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),"This structured red opens with aromas suggesting espresso, French oak, menthol, mature plum and a whiff of Asian spice. On the taut palate, hints of coffee, toast and clove accent a core of dried black cherry. Tightly wound, assertive tannins grip the finish. Give it a couple of years for the tannins to soften a little then drink up to capture the remaining fruit richness."
US,94,35,Red Blend,red,àMaurice 2007 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This vintage has the Horiuchi artist label. Another glorious wine from the 2007 vintage, full and forward, packed with plum and purple fruits. Sweet tobacco and baking spices lead into a lush, fruit-loaded core, ripe with berries and plums. The finish—thick and textural and darkly chocolaty—wraps around polished, elegant tannins."
US,91,20,Chardonnay,white,L'Ecole No. 41 2010 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"From a very cool vintage, this wine takes full advantage of the flavors the year delivered. Bracing and fresh, with a lively mix of lime and citrus fruits, its vivid acidity and a wash of wet rock, give it life and length across the palate. Complex and textural, this is a lovely wine."
US,87,23,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Dutton Estate 2013 Kylie's Cuvée Dutton Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Hinting at oak and steeped in ripe fig, this is a hearty white wine with an herbal edge, fermented in stainless steel and then aged in neutral oak. From prime spots within Dutton Ranch, it provides a layering of tropical pineapple and melon within a suggestion of lemon, finishing dry."
US,92,49,Chardonnay,white,Marimar Estate 2014 Bonita's Hill Don Miguel Vineyard Unfiltered Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Named for a beloved Springer Spaniel, this is pretty and bright, with an edgy line of acidity that supports a gravelly texture. Integrated oak contrasts against baked apple, honey and cinnamon flavors that are homey and comforting, finishing in a coconut flake tone."
Italy,92,35,Red Blend,red,Losi Querciavalle 2010 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Dark berry, cooking spice and tilled soil aromas lead the nose. The sleek, savory palate delivers juicy wild cherry, black raspberry, cinnamon, white pepper, mint and clove alongside supple tannins. Enjoy through 2018."
Italy,89,40,Sangiovese,red,Bindella 2009 I Quadri  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"I Quadri offers violet and iris aromas accented by vanilla and toasted oak sensations. The palate shows a black pepper streak wrapped around a core of plum and ripe cherry, finishing on a roasted coffee bean note. It's forward and ready to enjoy soon."
Italy,89,21,Red Blend,red,Pieve de' Pitti 2011 Cerretello  (Chianti Superiore),"Black plum, ripe dark berry, dried herb and menthol aromas lead the nose along with a whiff of leather. The firm palate delivers dried black cherry, prune, mocha and orange zest alongside compact tannins and soft acidity. A licorice note signals the finish. It's at its ideal drinking window so enjoy sooner rather than later."
US,85,35,Pinot Noir,red,Clos Pegase 2012 Mitsuko's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Light and clear in color, this vineyard-designate combines earthiness and oak in a slightly tart and oak-laden package, unsure whether to let the oak overpower or not. Wild strawberry and herb can be found within the folds."
Italy,95,56,Sangiovese,red,Gianni Brunelli 2011  Brunello di Montalcino,"Classic Sangiovese aromas of tilled soil, wild berry, new leather and chopped Mediterranean herb lead the nose along with a whiff of blue flower. The delicious, chewy palate doles out juicy Marasca cherry, black raspberry, baking spice and star anise framed in youthfully assertive but ripe tannins. Drink 2019–2029."
US,89,19,Chardonnay,white,Patit Creek Cellars 2009 Chardonnay (Red Mountain),"From the original Kiona vineyard planting in 1975, this big, lush Chardonnay fills the palate with ripe banana and stone fruit flavors. It was barrel fermented, then moved to stainless, and put through partial malolactic. Good definition, acidity, and a hint of minerality."
France,97,135,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Montrose 2014  Saint-Estèphe,"This is a very fine wine showing a new level of quality at Montrose. With its almost velvet tannins inside the intense black fruits, the wine is rich, smooth and generous. Blackberry and black-plum fruits are to the fore along with the fine acidity and great structure. A wine to age for decades, it will be ready to drink from 2027."
US,90,42,Pinot Noir,red,Maldonado 2011 Los Olivos Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"This is a rich, robust Pinot Noir, defining the big, tannic style. It explodes in cherry, cola and pomegranate fruit flavors, with the added note of caramelized oak. You can drink this wine now, but it should hold in the bottle for 6–8 years, gradually mellowing. The vineyard is in the cooler southern part of the valley, near Carneros."
France,93,90,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Joseph Mellot 2014 L'Original  (Sancerre),"Celebrating 500 years since the Mellot family started in Sancerre, this wine is a blend from some of the best parcels in the domaine. It is rich and intensely fruity, showing herbal, spice and juicy apple and pear flavors. These are sustained by the nervy, steely edge that will give this wine the chance to age. Drink from 2018."
US,85,12,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Mirassou 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"This wine veers slightly sweet, like many overripe red blends. It's deep in color, soft in and makes a good counterpoint to spicy foods."
US,82,11,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Robert Mondavi 2008 Private Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Gets the Cabernet job done with sweetish blackberry and black currant flavors, tinged with oak-like notes. But it's a fundamentally uninteresting wine, even at this price."
US,88,11,Zinfandel,red,Shenandoah 2008 Special Reserve Zinfandel (California),"A good, rich, spicy Zin that shows loads of character at a great price. Full-bodied and bone dry, it bursts with blackberry, tobacco, dark chocolate and pepper flavors."
Italy,82,16,Red Blend,red,Di Giovanna 2010 Gerbino Red (Sicilia),"Gerbino is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Nero d'Avola and Syrah that offers an awkward bouquet of red fruit, bitter almond and tangy dill. A charred burnt note also appears on the close."
France,91,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Haut Dina 2010  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"This is a very complete wine, with all the fruit and tannin elements in place. There's a fine and rich character here as well as a more austere, mineral side. The combination results in supporting tannins, dark fruits and good aging potential."
France,89,30,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2014 Réserve Pinot Noir (Alsace),"The nose is very quiet but the body emanates a generosity despite its lightness. There is red-cherry fruit and a certain ampleness on a slender, fresh body. Tannins are like barely-there linens. The finish is wonderfully clean."
US,85,23,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Wrath 2009 San Saba Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey),"Nicely dry and crisply acidic, with a minerally scour of stone that cleans the mouth and gets the tastebuds watering. The flavors are of cool-climate lemons, lime and grapefruits. But shows a considerable note of green, feline spray that lowers the score."
US,87,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Whitehall Lane 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Good, classic blackberry, currant, oak and mineral flavors in this dry, full-bodied wine. It's also pretty tannic, with an astringent mouthfeel. Doesn't have the stuffing to warrant aging, so give it an hour or two in the decanter and drink up."
US,88,25,Riesling,white,Silver Thread 2014 Doyle Fournier Vineyard Riesling (Seneca Lake),"Swathes of evergreen lend elegance to this piercing, steel-toned Riesling. On the palate, touches of honey lend a sunny sweetness to cutting lemon and lime flavors. A slick of honeycomb extends the finish."
US,88,150,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Grgich Hills 2008 Yountville Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"While this Cabernet is very rich and ripe in flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, crème de cassis and new oak, it's also very tannic. That bite of astringency gives it a rustic note. A very high, Port-like alcohol level may or may not thwart cellaring plans."
US,87,40,Chardonnay,white,Rock Wall 2015 Estate Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This wine hails from the family's Eastside Road vineyard, planted to old Wente Chardonnay in 1982. It boldly opens in a robust, full-bodied explosion of ripe tropical mango and dried apricot, with an oaky underbelly that gives the texture grip and additional density."
France,93,54,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Pascal Jolivet 2014 Le Roc  (Sancerre),"This wine comes from a single vineyard, planted on flint soil. It has a definite steely character that has been softened by the year in bottle. That gives a pure wine shot through with citrus and apples, showing power and concentration from the intense fruit. Drink the wine now."
US,90,19,Pinot Gris,white,Adelsheim 2010 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"The fruit shines here—pears and apples aplenty—with textural notes of citrus rind. Balanced, with medium length, it's a young, clean, lip-smacking style, with more density than most Oregon Pinot Gris."
Italy,92,20,White Blend,white,Le Casematte 2015 Peloro Bianco White (Terre Siciliane),"A blend of 65% Grillo and 35% Carricante, this offers subtle aromas of ripe orchard fruit, wild flower and a whiff of almond. The vibrant, savory palate boasts green apple, creamy white peach, citrus and aromatic herb alongside an energizing mineral vein. It finishes crisp and clean."
US,88,45,Pinot Noir,red,Kastania 2012 Estate Grown Proprietor's Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Initially dense and brooding, this wine reveals lightly etched layers of cherry and strawberry on the palate. Just the right accent of earthy dirt and stone round out the finish."
US,92,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Stevens 2009 424 Red (Yakima Valley),"This Bordeaux-style blend is 43% Cab Franc, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot and 5% Malbec, with no Petit Verdot in 2009. Young and muscular, it's built upon a base of firm black fruits, with plenty of cassis. The wine spent 20 months in 60% new French oak, and brings plenty of roasted coffee bean and dark cacao goodness to the finishing tannins."
US,87,25,White Blend,white,Pellegrini Vineyards 2016 Rejoyce White (North Fork of Long Island),This full bodied white blend offers the floral fruity perfume of Sauvignon Blanc along with the richness and cling of Chardonnay. Plush yellow-peach and grapefruit flavors are balanced by brisk acidity and a bristle of tea leaf on the finish.
US,89,28,Syrah,red,Robert Renzoni 2016 Lyric Rose of Syrah (Temecula Valley),"This is a very mineral-driven pink wine, with aromas of wet rocks, chalk and even steel giving way to the slightest hints of orange and strawberry. The flavors are very delicate and refreshing on the palate, with melon and red pear, rounded out by a key lime acidity."
US,87,34,Merlot,red,Freemark Abbey 2010 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Lots of rich, sweet flavors of raspberry, cherry and mocha appear in this vigorous, young Merlot. Blended from vineyards around the valley, it emphasizes fruit. Drink now with beef-based Mexican food."
US,89,20,Chardonnay,white,Pellegrini Vineyards 2015 Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),"Pellegrini's standard-label Chardonnay offers a brightness and vibe that stands out against the winery's oakier Vintner's Blend. There's ample toast and spice here, but it's deftly applied, highlighting the wine's rich, slightly leesy texture. Fresh acidity lends balance and grace. Drink now through 2020."
US,91,50,Pinot Noir,red,Loring Wine Company 2014 Graham Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"An enticing cedar and cinnamon aroma leads to robust spiced plum flavors and a lively combination of fine tannins and good acidity for balance. This is a bold, flavorful and ripe-tasting wine that also stays poised and appetizing. Not shabby at all and it should improve through at least 2020."
France,90,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Haut Sociondo 2014  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"This is a ripe, spicy and full-bodied wine from the Robin group of producers created by Grand Moulin's Jean-Francois Renaud in Blaye. The wine has both structure and rich blackberry fruit. The tannins are dusty, spicy and with fine acidity to balance. Drink this fine wine from 2019."
US,88,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Seven Hills 2014 Pepper Bridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Aromas of moist earth, black fruit, pencil lead and slightly overripe red apple are followed by a firm palate backed by lightly grippy tannins. This wine needs some food to keep them in check."
France,94,72,Pinot Gris,white,Domaine Schoffit 2007 Rangen Grand Cru Clos Saint Théobald Vendanges Tardives Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Earthy notes of pear mix with the generous sweetness of a late harvest wine. The palate is concentrated and lushly sweet, but full of rich flavors, tinged with pear and orange, caramel and lemon oil, acacia honey and candied lemon peel. Lovely, bright and still totally fresh. Drink 2016–2030."
US,86,38,Pinot Noir,red,Hawks View 2014 Hawks View Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Lightly earthy flavors of dried raspberries have a chunky, almost rustic character, with a bass note of wet cement. It's a serviceable wine, solid and short, with none of the elegance of the finer Pinots."
US,88,60,Pinot Noir,red,Tandem 2006 Silver Pines Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Coming on the heels of the magnificent 2005, the '06 is somewhat heavier and more direct, with a soft, full-bodied mouthfeel framing very ripe currant flavors that are somewhat meaty and raisined. Will grow rounder and more mellow in the cellar, but not much more complex."
US,91,60,Chardonnay,white,Gary Farrell 2015 Rochioli-Allen Vineyards Clone 76 Concrete Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This fine, small-production wine is fermented and aged predominantly in concrete egg—the better to preserve and promote its beautifully crisp, briny green-apple and pear flavors. Its sharp acidity acts as a squeeze of lemon, making it all the more satisfying."
France,91,30,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Branas Grand Poujeaux 2014  Moulis-en-Médoc,"The wine has weight, tannins and a firm structure. At the same time, its ripe black fruits are developing to fill out the structure and give an impressive wine. Hints of dark chocolate go with the juicy acidity to leave a wine that has several years to develop. Drink from 2021."
US,90,52,Syrah,red,Bien Nacido 2009 Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),"This is a dry, finely acidic Syrah, whose sour cherry and tart persimmon flavors have just a touch of smoky new oak. It's not offering everything it has, but hangs back a little, teasing with nuance and subtlety. A very good Syrah that's drinking well now and should age well over the next 5–7 years."
US,88,45,Merlot,red,Hunt Cellars 2010 Unforgettable Destiny Vineyards Merlot (Paso Robles),"Clay and minty cola aromas give nuance to the soft, dark, perfectly ripe blueberry fruit on the nose of this wine. Fine-grained but sticky tannins and a pinch of acidity frame the sip, where dark-roast espresso, beef char and cigar smoke flavors reign."
US,89,29,Red Blend,red,Dunham 2011 Trutina Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of 57% Merlot, 37% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% Syrah, this opens with a sweetly spiced bouquet of red and purple fruits. The medium weight midpalate brings tart plum and cherry flavors, plentiful acidity and moderate, balanced tannins. Drink now through 2020."
US,84,29,Zinfandel,red,Turley 2010 Cedarman Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"Underripe and slender, this wine's vegetal flavors appear alongside its blackberry note. Although it's dry and balanced, with firm Howell Mountain tannins, it implies richness but doesn't really deliver. The thinness allows the high alcohol to become prominent, making the wine feel hot."
US,89,32,Pinot Noir,red,Mercy 2014 Riverbed Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco),"Concentrated lavender and incense aromas make for a woody perfume on the nose of this appellation blend, giving lots of character to the core of cherry syrup. The palate shows the same levels of intense incense and purple flowers, which nearly overpowers the cranberry and pomegranate fruits."
US,87,16,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Lieb 2014 Bridge Lane Red (New York),"Whiffs of black cherry, rose petal and spice scent this invigoratingly crisp red blend. It's satisfyingly full in body but impeccably balanced, offering taut black-cherry and plum flavors. Aged minimally in oak, there's not a lot of fuss or complication on the palate, but it's delightfully fresh and tasty. Drink now through 2019."
France,88,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château La Fortine 2008 Cuvée Les Cèdres  (Saint-Émilion),"The tannins are firm and dry, producing a solid structure. A black currant flavor emerges slowly, offering a fruity counterpoint. Although the wine—named after the cedar trees on the property—is ripe and tarry, it needs another year or two."
US,84,11,Pinot Grigio,white,Heartache 2012 Passionate Squeeze Pinot Grigio (California),"This is an extroverted version of a varietal that can be quite subtle. Aromas suggest grapefruit and pears, while flavors are assertive and citruslike, with an earthy accent. The feel in the mouth is reasonably crisp."
US,87,20,Syrah,red,Hightower 2008 Murray Syrah (Red Mountain),"Big and bold, loaded with red fruits and sharp acidity, the Murray Syrah from Hightower brings a spicy mix of fruit, loam and mineral. There's some heat in it as well. The grapes are estate grown, and the Syrah was cofermented with 5% Viognier."
US,85,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Magness 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Here's a good Cabernet to drink now. It's soft and gritty in tannins, with ripely forward blackberry, cherry and currant flavors, coated with sweet, smoky oak."
France,92,38,Riesling,white,Cave de Ribeauvillé 2009 Osterberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Showing signs of maturity, this is a delicious, rich and ripe wine, full of citrus, mineral and perfumed white fruits. Though rich, it is also bone dry, with tight texture and powerful acidity."
US,86,36,Red Blend,red,Cinnabar NV Cruvée Lot III Red (California),"Tastes sharp in acidity and frankly sweet, with sugary blackberry and cherry jam flavors that finish in a swirl of baking spices. The blend is Syrah, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah."
US,89,40,Syrah,red,Amalie Robert 2011 Satisfaction Syrah (Willamette Valley),"A handful of Willamette Valley wineries grow Syrah, pushing the grape to an earthy, herbal style, amplified here by the cool 2011 vintage. Tart berry, leaf and herb combine in a tight, tannic midpalate. There are interesting highlights of orange peel as well, and a lingering, subtle finish."
US,95,125,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Salvestrin 2007 3D Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"Sweet new oak stands out, giving this Cabernet caramel aromas and flavors. But the oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's massive power. Underneath the wood char is a dry, tannic wine with rich blackberry and currant flavors. It's a bit disjointed now, needing time for everything to mesh together. Could be really something around 2015."
France,89,36,Riesling,white,Domaine François Schmitt 2014 Grand Cru Pfingstberg Paradis Riesling (Alsace),"Hints of pear perfume the nose on this wine, while the defined palate is bright with lemony freshness. Bundled concentration at the lean, taut core will round out with more bottle age. Drink 2017–2025."
US,90,17,Chardonnay,white,Bearboat 2008 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Made in a Chablis style, this Chardonnay is bone dry and crisp in acidity. The pineapple and peach flavors are integrated with stony minerals. It's not a complex wine, but is super-clean and zesty, a nice complement to shellfish, mushroom risotto or a perfectly roasted chicken."
US,90,37,Sangiovese,red,Le Vigne 2014 Di Domenico Sangiovese (Paso Robles),"The Fillippini family has been growing grapes in eastern Paso Robles since 1982, and this is among their better modern bottlings. The nose offers light sandalwood, ripe cranberry and river stone mineral scents. Its punchy berry fruit is underlaid with leather and cigar accents on the palate, where buoyant acidity and grippy tannic structure pervades."
US,86,26,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Justin 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Dry and tannic, this fresh young Cabernet shows good varietal flavors of blackberries and currants, touched by smoky oak. There are some green notes. It's a sound wine, but unlikely to develop, so drink up."
US,90,24,Red Blend,red,Angel Vine 2012 The Hellion Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This blend of Primitivo (43%), Petite Sirah (28%) and Zinfandel offers aromas of blackberry jam, plum, dried fruit and baking spices. It's full bodied and palate coating with high-octane fruit flavors that linger."
Italy,89,24,Sangiovese,red,Fattoria Poggerino 2010  Chianti Classico,"This shows ripe cherry, plum and spice aromas, with hints of oak and mint. The palate is still a bit shy but reveals restrained notes of wild cherry, pepper and toasty, well-integrated oak. Drink 2015–2020."
Italy,81,12,Sangiovese,red,Colognole 1997 Chianti Rufina  (Chianti Rufina),"This is a big burly wine that just has too many off aromas. Heavy barnyard scents mix with tart berry and espresso elements, and although there's body here, and what seem to be basically good elements, the stable-like odors stop the show."
France,92,30,Riesling,white,Joseph Cattin 2013 Hatschbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Concentrated citrus fruit sings on nose and palate. The body reveals a stony, mineral texture of exquisitely clean dryness. There is the slightest edge of pleasant bitterness, just like in dried lemon peel. Linear, concentrated with lots of citric backbone. Drink 2016–2025."
US,88,15,Red Blend,red,Hedges 2014 C.M.S. Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot each make up 43% of this blend, with the balance Syrah. Somewhat reticent aromas of herb, red apple, cherry and spice lead to smooth silky red and black-fruit flavors. It brings a lot of appeal."
US,90,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Oberon 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa County),"Sourced from all over the Napa Valley, this wine blends 87% Cabernet Sauvignon with 1% Syrah and other unnamed red varieties. The effort works, resulting in a glass of concentrated red cherry, herb and spice, the tannins tight yet approachable enough for the wine to remain juicy."
US,87,21,Chardonnay,white,Briceland 2012 Lolonis Vineyard Chardonnay (Mendocino County),"Crisp, clean and easy to drink, this Mendocino Chardonnay is all lemon and just-ripe pear, with a smooth texture. Pair with lemon chicken or wintertime crab."
US,87,14,Pinot Gris,white,Spindrift Cellars 2009 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Whole cluster fermented in stainless steel, this is big and spicy, with a lovely textural impact. The aromas and flavors run to honeyed pears and very ripe apples; the finish is resonant and surprisingly mature for a 2009. Drink up."
Italy,86,20,Pinot Grigio,white,Piera Martellozzo NV Perle di Piera Silver Pearl Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie),"There aren't too many sparkling Pinot Grigios, but this is the one to try if you're curious. It offers substance and creaminess, with a subtle bouquet of citrus and stone fruit."
US,88,22,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cameron Hughes 2010 Lot 332 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Juicy, sweet and fat in glycerine, this has complex flavors of blackberry and cherry pie filling. The tannins and acids give it a fine, elegant structure. Drink now."
US,82,20,Chardonnay,white,Magness 2010 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"A simple wine, made for modern tastes, with sugary orange, vanilla and buttered toast flavors."
France,89,58,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine de Bellene 2010 Vieilles Vignes  (Côtes de Nuits Villages),"This has weight and ripe plum and damson flavors that are now integrating into the tannins. It's worth aging for a few years, but it is already enjoyable."
US,91,60,Pinot Noir,red,Black Ridge 2013 Barn Block Reserve Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Clove, star anise and deep strokes of red cherry show on the nose of this bottling from one of the estate's best blocks. The palate is redolent with bay leaf and eucalyptus, which give depth to the red-cherry, cranberry and tart pomegranate flavors."
France,91,18,Pinot Gris,white,Domaine Jean Sipp 2014 Réserve Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Appetizing and warmly generous pear notes characterize the nose. The palate has the same, friendly fruit, boosted by some residual sugar. The plump fruit is countered by ample lemony freshness that creates an inherent balance. The finish is just off dry, but very refreshing."
US,84,23,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Parmeson 2016 Indian Springs Ranch Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley),"This wine is tenacious in its grassy mix of pea shoots and gooseberry, interwoven with acidity that takes on a tartness that's not entirely pleasant."
US,90,10,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Bergevin Lane 2012 Linen Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This lovely blend of Sauvignon Blanc, and 14% Roussanne, is as crisp and fresh as its name implies. Bright fruit flavors of lemon, lime, orange and pineapple speak to the success of this unusual blend. It's a bracing, palate-cleansing white wine that will be appealing all year round."
US,86,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Sebastiani 2000 Cohen Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Aromas of fresh green straw and citrus set the stage for a mouth full of grass and citrus, which may sound strange, but it's what we found. The finish is tangy and hard-edged, but a touch of sweetness saves it from a worse fate and actually brings the wine to a good finish. About 40% of the cuvée was barrel fermented, which gives it a softer feel than it might otherwise have."
US,90,47,Pinot Noir,red,Segue 2007 Filigreen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Sharp acidity makes this young wine a bit tart now. It has solid flavors of cherries, raspberries, bacon and smoky sandalwood, and is dry and silky. Decant for a few hours, or better yet, give it a year or two in the cellar."
US,89,38,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Raymond 2009 Reserve Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Marked by deep, delicious flavors of chocolate, blueberries and blackberries, this is a lovely Cabernet to drink now. The tannins are firm, the finish long and spicy. Shows real Napa class."
US,92,150,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Metaphora 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Made from Howell Mountain and St. Helena fruit, this wine is rich and savory, with black currants and cassis, a tang of minerality and plenty of rich, toasted oak flavor. The finish is dry, but the tannins are quite strong. This 100% Cabernet needs serious time in the cellar; hold until 2018, and it could go for another decade."
US,89,14,Red Blend,red,Vina Robles 2006 Red Huerhuero Red (Paso Robles),"Opens with a blast of freshly ground black peppercorns, and that peppery tastes travels into the flavor. A very unusual and distinctive wine, it's absolutely, refreshingly dry, with richer notes of cherries, currants and tangerine zest, finishing with a swirl of spicy anise, clove and cinnamon."
France,84,20,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Fayau 2013  Bordeaux Blanc,"This wine is all about fruitiness, its crisp texture merely an aid to the lively acidity and herbaceous character. Cool and fresh, it delivers a bright aftertaste of lime juiciness."
US,82,10,Red Blend,red,Vivác Winery NV Red Hot Mama Red (New Mexico),"This red blend offers a nose of spiced wood, tobacco and pepper, and on the palate, light, simple flavors of red fruit and cigar box. There's a lot of oak here, venturing into a maple syrup character, and overall, the wine is a bit clunky, but it's reasonably priced and from a unique location, giving it a fun spin."
France,88,30,Pinot Noir,red,Henri de Villamont 2005 Le Village  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),"From the Villamont domaine, this is a soft, rounded, quite generous wine that is dominated by enjoyable bright red fruits. It's fresh, ripe, just lightly touched by tannins, and with a juicy, friendly aftertaste."
US,93,45,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Bonny Doon 2011 Le Cigare Volant Red (Central Coast),"Randall Grahm's blend of 37% Mourvèdre, 34% Grenache, 20% Syrah and 9% Cinsault offers intriguing asphalt, black pepper, boysenberry and a tiny bit of barnyard funk on the nose. It's dark and brooding, with flavors of black pepper, leather and black fruits on the palate, but rather light and lean in texture, with a solid amount of tannic grip."
US,86,24,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Greedy 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley),"While this Sauvignon Blanc seems to have some sweetness, it also has crisp acidity and pleasing minerality that gives the citrus and tropical fruit flavors a tang. It would pair nice with Vietnamese noodle dishes or chicken tacos."
US,91,49,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Martin Ranch 2012 Thérèse Vineyards Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Done in the classically savory Santa Cruz Mountains style, this bottling shows black and red licorice on the nose along with blueberry and blackberry fruit. It's brisk on the palate and still wound up tightly, with blackberry, peppercorn and black-olive flavors lifted by dried herbs."
France,91,40,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Chateau d'Angludet 2014  Margaux,This is a wine that brings out all the bright fruit of the vintage. It has classic black-currant flavors and crisp acidity. The tannins are a firm supporting act to this wine that will develop well over the medium term.
France,87,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Haut Bessac 2012  Bordeaux Supérieur,"Ripe and full in the mouth, this rich wine features juicy black fruits and aromatic acidity. Piled high with berry flavors, it's ready to drink."
US,89,50,Pinot Noir,red,Aubichon Cellars 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Though 2014 is a fine, accessible vintage for many Oregon Pinots, this one is rather stubbornly shut down. At first it shows stem and herb flavors, along with chewy tannins. With hours of breathing time, the fruit emerges, a mix of rhubarb, cherry and a dash of cola."
Italy,86,50,Merlot,red,Petra 2003 Quercegobbe Merlot (Toscana),"The fruit appears very ripe, almost too ripe, making the wine difficult to pair with food because of the width and intensity of its jammy nose. Yet more harmonious tones of chocolate, coffee and spice kick in at the rear to add dimension."
US,87,38,Chardonnay,white,JM Cellars 2013 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This blend of Stillwater Creek and Conner Lee vineyards conveys aromas of pear, yellow apple, pineapple and butter. The concentration is light yet creamy with a warm finish."
US,90,45,Zinfandel,red,Rosenblum 2011 Maggie's Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Spicy, dusty and juicy, this wine is a mix of black plum and black cherry, supported by whips of anise and bay leaf that give it an herbal element, possibly reflective of the cooler vintage. Medium acidity and firm tannins round out the experience."
France,88,12,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Boisson 2014  Bordeaux Blanc,"Steel and nervy mineralogy are the hallmarks of this wine at this stage. It's still waiting for the fruit to develop, but expect crisp citrus and succulent apples. The aftertaste, tensely fresh now, should soften as the wine develops. This 90% Sauvignon Blanc and 10% Sémillon blend comes from the estate's small vineyard on the slope near Cadillac."
US,87,25,Syrah,red,Wellington 2008 Estate Vineyard Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"Dry and tannic, this Syrah offers rich, spicy notes of blackberry, currant and leather. Drink it now with grilled lamb."
US,87,18,Red Blend,red,Stevens 2009 YesOuiSi Red Red (Yakima Valley),"This is made from declassified barrels originally intended for Stevens 424. It's sharp-edged and spicy, not yet wellintegrated, but substantial, with wild berry flavors and slightly green tannins. A good quaffer, or pair it with a flank steak."
US,89,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Clos Pegase 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Juicy cranberry and cassis characterize this Cab, given ample time in bottle. Soft and medium in terms of weight and body, it's fluid in fruit, with a leathery finish."
US,93,38,Red Blend,red,Écluse 2013 Improv Red (Paso Robles),"A nontraditional blend of 44% Zinfandel, 31% Syrah, 15% Merlot and 10% Petite Sirah, this bottling shows tight blueberry, milk chocolate, river rocks and rose petals on the dynamic nose. The palate is juicy with more blueberry and vanilla, but bound by a plum-skin tartness and a decently strong tannic grip."
US,88,36,Pinot Noir,red,Vista Hills 2011 Marylhurst Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Light aromas of the barnyard don't impede the impression of pretty strawberry-pastry fruit flavors. The aging in 20% new French oak adds streaks of vanilla, cocoa and mocha to the finish."
France,88,17,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Haut Mouleyre 2016  Bordeaux Blanc,"This delicious wine from old Sémillon vines offers a hint of nuts and spice as well as crisp, clean fruit. It is lively with acidity as well as having a richer side. The wine will be just right from the end of 2017."
US,90,55,Pinot Noir,red,Fess Parker 2013 Older Barrels Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Dark strawberry fruit meets with rustic earthy aromas and light allspice notes on the nose of this wine from the late actor's family-owned winery. The palate shows boisterous and tart cranberry and black raspberry fruit, with pencil lead minerality and great energy, if not a ton of complexity."
US,91,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Native Sun 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"All varietal coming from Heart of the Hill Vineyard, this brooding wine offers aromas of dark coffee, cherry, bittersweet chocolate, clove and assorted barrel spices (80% new French). It's classically styled with reserved, almost elegant fruit flavors, bright acid and firm tannins that need time in the cellar to soften. Best after 2020."
US,87,20,Chardonnay,white,Ironstone 2013 Reserve Estate Grown Chardonnay (Sierra Foothills),"This is not a showy wine, but the sense of reserve, good acidity, fresh flavors and good balance form an enjoyable picture that will be versatile with food."
US,89,56,Pinot Noir,red,Talisman 2013 Wildcat Mountain Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Presenting at first as somewhat reduced, this wine is tart and feral, with a muskiness reminiscent of mushroom and forest floor. Its intensely voluptuous body is concentrated in black cherry, cola and cardamom, with a richness and roundness on the palate and finish."
US,89,55,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,In Re 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oak Knoll District),"Tough, dry and tannic, this Cabernet punches its way through the mouth like an angry kickboxer. Deep down inside beats a heart of blackberries and black currants, impressively ripe and delicious. Will it age? Probably. Try after 2013, and could go for the long haul."
US,88,25,Zinfandel,red,Decoy 2014 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Red fruit dominates in this tightly woven, firmly tannic wine, blended with 9% Petite Sirah. Hints of charred campfire oak support black pepper, cinnamon and berry, the texture smooth and soft."
US,93,75,Pinot Noir,red,Adelsheim 2013 Calkins Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This stunning wine offers strawberry-shortcake goodness, with a hint of cream. It's pretty, fine-tuned and quite young, with suggestions of rhubarb and cranberry. Give it plenty of breathing time and enjoy it now through 2025."
US,91,24,Riesling,white,Penner-Ash 2015 Riesling (Willamette Valley),"Dry and sappy, this potent effort is heavily influenced by botanical flavors, to the point of being almost grassy. Dry extract and lemon/lime acidity keep the riper fruit flavors in check, but with ample breathing time the wine fills in with highlights of fresh peaches."
France,84,26,Chardonnay,white,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2013  Bourgogne,"Crisp with an edge of honey, this is a ripe and fruity wine. Along with apple and cantaloupe melon flavors it has a nutty character and some light acidity, both of which add to its simple attraction. Drink now."
US,87,15,Pinot Gris,white,Illahe 2011 Estate Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Stainless fermented and aged, this tart, apple-flavored Pinot Gris is close to fresh cider in flavor. The alcohol is low enough that it is almost invisible. Just pure, juicy, clean fruit comes through."
US,91,50,Pinot Noir,red,Ziata 2014 Chenoweth Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"From a great site in this cool appellation, this wine shines with a powerful grip of ripe cherry and strawberry fruit and earthy undertones of dried herb and cardamom cola. Layered and dense, it has a seductively smooth texture and bite of minerality."
US,93,40,Syrah,red,La Voix 2014 So What Rancho San Ysidro Syrah (Ballard Canyon),"Steve Clifton's music-inspired project heads to the Syrah-focused appellation of Ballard Canyon to produce this well-hewn bottling that kicks off with boysenberry, hibiscus, rose bud and white pepper aromas. Tart elderberry jam flavors meld with wild thyme and savory pepper spice on the complex palate, which culminates in a mouthwatering finish."
France,90,33,Chardonnay,white,Olivier Leflaive 2014 Oncle Vincent  (Bourgogne),"This is a beautifully aromatic wine with toast and yellow fruits mingling easily together. It is ripe while also light to taste, a crisp burst of acidity giving the wine a fine lift. Yellow fruits, citrus and toast play together in this attractive wine that is ready to drink."
France,84,12,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Lamothe-Vincent 2007  Bordeaux Blanc,"Initially ripe and creamy, the wine tightens up with herbaceous, lemongrass flavors, only hinting at the richness. It needs another six months in bottle before drinking."
US,87,14,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Estancia 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Slightly shy dark fruit, spice and gravel aromas show on the nose of this affordably priced bottling. Cranberry, dried herb and mineral flavors are apparent on the palate, which finishes on a fruit punch note."
US,85,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Chatham NV Church Creek Vintner's Blend Red (Virginia's Eastern Shore),"This nonvintage, Bordeaux-style blend is predominately grapes from the 2012 harvest, with a small addition of 2011 to add balance. The nose is spice-driven, with tart currant and green peppercorn pervading. The palate shows a bit more ripeness, offering tart plum and blackberry up front, but leads to a slightly green and astringent finish."
US,93,65,Pinot Noir,red,Gary Farrell 2009 Rochioli Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is currently very dry and austere due to its tannins, but it's impressive for its noble structure and deep, complex flavors of blackberries, cranberries, brown sugar and spices.- With such depth and a long finish, it's clearly a cellar candidate. Don't even think about opening it until 2017, at least."
US,86,45,Pinot Noir,red,Peters Family 2009 Sonoma Stage VIneyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine is heavy and full-bodied for Pinot Noir, with soft acids and rich cherry, currant, anise and mocha flavors. Doesn't have the structure for aging, so drink up."
US,93,55,Pinot Noir,red,Boheme 2014 Taylor Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Velvety on the palate, this coastal wine from a site three miles from the Pacific Ocean shows cool-climate savory tones of cranberry, rose petal and pine, with streaks of black licorice adding to the complex range of flavor. Integrated and lushly elegant, it finishes in a strong touch of cardamom."
US,93,40,Syrah,red,Covenant 2014 Landsman Syrah (Bennett Valley),"A bold and brawny wine from a relatively cool appellation, this red satisfies with its commingling of violet, meat and leathery black pepper aromas. Despite its brambly depth and concentration, it allows for a satisfying twist of freshness on the finish."
France,92,40,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Chenevières 2014 Fourchaume Premier Cru  (Chablis),"Full of fruit, this also expresses a tight and mineral sense of terroir. Tangy, packed with white fruit and green plums cut with lime juice, this ripe, full-bodied wine is going to be delicious. Drink from 2018."
US,83,25,Merlot,red,Sweet Valley 2007 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Some wines can hit 15.4% alcohol, as this does, and make it work. But here the burn and scorch from the alcohol simply overwhelms some excellent fruit. Detail is lost, and what's left is a hot, jammy red."
US,91,19,Pinot Gris,white,Elk Cove 2015 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"One of Oregon's finest values in Pinot Gris, this offers big, juicy flavors of luscious apple and pear, backed with punchy citrus. The ample acidity tastes of lemon and grapefruit, and a notable wash of minerality comes up in the finish. The blend includes small percentages of Gewürztraminer and Muscat."
Italy,92,77,Red Blend,red,Masi 2009 Costasera Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"This toasty expression of Amarone delivers espresso, subtle oak, plum cake and smoky aromas. On the palate, notes of tobacco leaf and grilled herbs accent the primary raisin and prune flavors alongside tightly packed tannins that need a few more years to unwind. Drink after 2017."
US,88,28,Pinot Noir,red,Animale 2014 Pinot Noir,"Listed as well in excess of 15% alcohol, this is sourced from a single vineyard in a hot year. The grapes were left to hang while sugars rose precipitously. Flavors suggest mincemeat pie, brown sugar and root beer. Not typical, but tasty enough. Drink over the next year for peak flavor."
US,91,23,Sauvignon Blanc,white,VML 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Grapefruit rind jumps out of the glass in this vivid, balanced and refreshing white that also carries a complex mix of lime, more grapefruit and the tiniest suggestion of fresh-cut grass. A creaminess to the texture rounds things out and soothes the edges."
US,88,26,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Auclair 2012 96 Cedars Red (Red Mountain),"Aromas of dates, leather and spice are followed by cherry, licorice and medicine-cabinet flavors backed by lightly dry tannins. Drink now."
US,84,38,Zinfandel,red,Saini 2011 Old Vine Pear Block Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"There's a toothpasty sweetness to this Zin, like a raspberry mint candy. Also odd is that it's already throwing significant sediment even though it's still a young wine. Eccentric, but it has its charms."
Italy,89,14,Chardonnay,white,Rotari NV Brut Talento Chardonnay (Trento),"With an amazingly large case production, you should have absolutely no problem finding this well valued Italian sparkler at the retailer nearest you. It offers toasted bread, lemon curd and toasted almond on the fresh finish."
Italy,88,39,Red Blend,red,Gino Fasoli 2015 La Corte del Pozzo  (Valpolicella Ripasso),"Aromas of prune, raisin and graphite come together in this wine. The ample palate delivers blackberry, clove and orange peel alongside chewy tannins. Enjoy through 2020."
US,89,32,Chardonnay,white,Sante Arcangeli 2012 Bald Mountain Vineyard Chardonnay (Ben Lomond Mountain),"This Chardonnay is almost Chablisian—it's bone dry, bristling with acidity, and modest in alcohol. There's a lick of minerality to the lemon peel, apricot and buttered toast flavors that makes the wine tangy. It's ready to drink now."
US,90,55,Zinfandel,red,Robert Biale 2015 Stagecoach Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"This wine has a quiet entry and soft lilt of cinnamon and black pepper spice. A grip of strong-willed tannin envelops a firm concentration of red berry, leather pouch and mountain sage."
US,88,22,Pinot Noir,red,Carneros Highway 2013 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Drinkable now, this wine opens with a syrupy grenadine aroma that rises to the top, followed by enjoyable layers of black cherry, mushroomy earth and silky, smooth tannins. Not overly complicated or overpriced, it'll please a crowd and do service to midweek meals."
US,94,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Laura Zahtila 2007 Barlow Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga),"Very dark, rich and dramatic. Massively constructed, with vast reserves of blackberry jam, blackstrap molasses, mocha, smoked meat, mushu plum sauce and sweet, smoky oak. The tannins are big, ripe and astringent. A great Cabernet that clearly needs plenty of time. Drink 2015 and beyond."
US,88,72,Zinfandel,red,Rusack 2014 Santa Catalina Island Vineyards Zinfandel (California),"Old Zinfandel plant material from Santa Cruz was propagated in one of the most inhospitable sites for grapes on Catalina Island to make this wine—a fascinating story for any history lover. The wine itself is somewhat simple, with generic red fruit, turned loam and black pepper scents, followed by cranberry, white pepper and crushed rock flavors on the palate."
US,88,22,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Canoe Ridge 2014 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"Aromas of garden herbs, cherry and bittersweet chocolate lead to medium-bodied fruit and barrel flavors. The tannins are quite firm and need some time (hopefully) to soften. The oak seems to get out front."
US,92,54,Pinot Noir,red,Saintsbury 2011 Cerise Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This Pinot is not hiding behind anything. It has lots of natural-tasting fruit aromas and flavors without overt oak. Flavors recall cherry, berry and rhubarb; the wine tastes firm and moderately tannic, and has medium to full body. Beautifully balanced, it should improve through 2018."
Italy,88,26,White Blend,white,Il Roncal 2006 Ploe di Stelis White (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"Deep golden notes of honey, stone fruit and acacia flower open this beautifully luminous blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon and Riesling. The wine has a creamy, rich personality and brightens the palate with its crisp, almost steely freshness."
US,84,28,Syrah,red,Highway 12 2006 Estate Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"This Syrah is pretty good, but it tastes heavy and a little overripe. The blackberry, currant and unsweetened chocolate flavors have a bitter, dessicated fruit edge."
US,92,49,Pinot Noir,red,Cumbre of Vine Hill 2006 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"A beautiful young Pinot Noir, gorgeously structured in acids and tannins, and intricately layered. Assaults the palate with grilled raspberries and cherries, with notes of mocha, anise and pepper. Just lovely with a great steak."
US,89,32,Chardonnay,white,Carter Estate 2012 Blanc de Blanc Chardonnay (South Coast),"Tight and fresh aromas of Asian pear, honeysuckle and key lime pie converge on this sparkler from a new estate in Temecula. The palate shows sliced apples, yellow pears, ripe nectarine, rounder white peach and even creamy cherimoya flavors. Though the region is known more for almond-flavored sparklers, they seem to do regular bubbles well."
France,92,75,Chardonnay,white,Louis Jadot 2009 Charmes Premier Cru  (Meursault),"A wine that reveals a textured side of Meursault. It has weight, ripe apricot and pineapple fruit with a refreshing touch of acidity. But the chalky, mineral character equally defines the wine. Age for 3–4 years."
US,91,38,Pinot Noir,red,Anaba 2012 Las Brisas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Sizable tannin, weight and oak suggest cellaring this wine through 2019. The time will be well spent developing this wine's generously robust and vibrant swirls of wild strawberry, black cherry and baking spices. Bright acidity and floral aromas of violet and rose complete the lovely package."
US,87,24,Riesling,white,Lamoreaux Landing 2016 Yellow Dog Vineyard Estate Bottled Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Bramble and dusty mineral tones lend a savoriness to this zesty lime-tinged wine. It's still tightly wound, showing more earth than fruit, but it's a fresh citrusy wine with vitality. The finish is just a shade off dry."
Italy,87,23,Sangiovese,red,Melini 1998 Riserva La Selvanella  (Chianti Classico),"Melini's Riserva, from a 98 acre vineyard in Radda in Chianti, is still firmly traditional in character. With its firm, dry bitter cherry fruit flavors and just a light touch of wood, it shows how classic Chianti winemaking still has a place, provided it is used in the right way."
Italy,87,33,Red Blend,red,Talosa 2013  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,"Spiced plum and oak aromas lead the nose of this firm red. The palate is lean, offering sour cherry, vanilla, sage and coconut notes over a frame of astringent tannins."
US,91,22,Chardonnay,white,Amalie Robert 2014 Her Silhouette Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"All stainless-fermented and aged, this deserves to be on your short list of can't-miss choices in a domestic Chardonnay. Year after year it scores well, with fresh, vivid fruit, a crisp and inviting mouthfeel, lively spices and ripe tree fruits. There's a seam of wintergreen running alongside in this new vintage, leaving your mouth feeling scrubbed clean."
US,91,30,Pinot Noir,red,Gainey 2014 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"A solid Pinot Noir for its price, this offers all the expected flavors and strikes a balance between richness and freshness. Wild cherry, anise, sagebrush and slate aromas lead into a palate that packs ripe red fruit upfront, followed by tangy elderberry, plum skin, hibiscus and rose. A touch of elderflower adds depth."
US,91,25,Pinot Noir,red,La Crema 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is an impressive wine at the price and production level, a great go-to for multiple occasions. It delivers earthy, candied strawberry around a light, bright core, remaining soft and smooth in texture and intensity, finishing with a tease of milk chocolate."
Italy,91,160,Syrah,red,Le Macchiole 2010 Scrio Syrah (Toscana),"Made entirely with Syrah, this concentrated wine delivers plum, black pepper, cocoa, coffee, fleshy black cherry and notes of bay leaf. It's plush, soft and savory but it also seems shy on vibrancy and essential energy. Drink sooner rather than later."
US,92,35,Red Blend,red,Soos Creek 2006 Artist Series #6 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The vineyard sources for this Bordeaux-style blend—Champoux, Ciel du Cheval, Weinbau and Dineen—are impeccable, and represent four of the best AVAs in Washington. It's almost exactly half and half Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, and smells like beautifully ripe blackberries, boysenberries and cassis. It sets up in the mouth firm and textural, and adds layers of chocolate and baking spices as it winds through the finish. Not a soft wine, but more open and accessible than most vintages of Soos Creek."
France,88,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château de Côme 2012  Saint-Estèphe,"This wine has a rich core of black fruits, dense tannins and good acidity, offering testimony to the firm character of Saint-Estèphe. Concentrated. it will develop well. Wait until 2018."
Italy,86,17,Red Blend,red,Villa Calcinaia 2013 Piegaia  (Chianti Classico),"Aromas of tilled earth, truffle and woodland berry lead the nose.

US,87,38,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Sevtap 2012 Zig-A-Zig-Ahh Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"The nose on this wine by oil worker-turned-winemaker Ert Sevtap offers lifting aromas of blueberry and mint. The spearmint notes carry to the palate as well, which also shows blackberry fruit and roasted beef meatiness."
US,89,39,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Pech Merle 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Very ripe in blackberries and cherries, with a nice coating of toasty oak, with a long, spicy finish. The texture is a bit aggressive, with sandpapery tannins. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink now–2015."
France,91,101,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Faiveley 2011 Les Porets Saint-Georges Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),"The 60% new wood aging is showing strongly in this structured wine. Rich and rounded, it offers hints of spice, red cherry fruits and a firmly, tannic edge. The aftertaste brings out a jammy richness. Drink from 2017."
US,84,17,Chardonnay,white,Swedish Hill 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Pressed apple notes are touched with butter and creamed corn on this savory-style Chardonnay. It's rich and full on the palate with a satisfying silkiness that's brightened with lemony acidity.
US,91,55,Pinot Noir,red,Rex Hill 2012 Roserock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The Roserock cuvée is notably dark and concentrated, with loads of ripe black cherry fruit. The nose is spicy, and flavors are saturated with luscious mocha. This is a fine example of the vintage, ready to enjoy immediately."
US,88,80,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Gorman 2014 The Albatross Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"Barrel aromas are up front on this wine, with notes of char, smoke and coffee bean ahead of herb and cherry. On the palate, the barrel influence also seems to overwhelm the fruit, which doesn't quite have the strength to stand up. Additional time in the bottle might bring it around."
Italy,84,12,Sangiovese,red,Cecchi 1998  Chianti Classico,The cherries and dark plums on the nose and palate are accented by herbs and cinnamon. This light and dry wine is mildly astringent and closes with tart raspberry and cedar notes.
US,95,30,Chardonnay,white,Au Bon Climat 2007 Santa Barbara Historic Vineyards Collection Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Amazingly rich and ripe, defining the Bien Nacido cool-climate style. The grapes hung for a long time in this excellent vintage, getting ripe and balanced, and the wine offers dazzling opulence, while preserving vital acidity. Showcases dessert pastry flavors of pineapples, mangoes, buttered toast, buttercream, meringue and honeysuckle, accented with dusty spices. Simply beautiful from first sniff to the last swallow."
France,86,14,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château la Voie 2014  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"The wine is structured with firm tannins as well as ripe fruit. Juicy and concentrated, it has a spicy character that comes from the wood aging. In the Mayé Eymery family since 1854, the wine is from six parcels on the estate. Give this fresh as well as rich wine until 2019."
Italy,94,79,Sangiovese,red,Castello di Verrazzano 2011 Sassello Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),"Leather, game, blue flowers and ripe, dark-skinned fruit aromas open this full-bodied wine made from the estate's highest vineyards.

US,92,25,Pinot Gris,white,Les Belles Collines 2014 Pinot Gris (California),"Completely stainless-fermented and aged, this is a blockbuster of a white wine, refreshing and exotic in floral intoxication.

US,88,37,Pinot Noir,red,Gundlach Bundschu 2012 Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This bottling comes from the winery's Rhinefarm Estate Vineyard near the town of Sonoma, planted to eight separate Pinot Noir blocks.

Italy,85,15,Chardonnay,white,Villa Rubini 2007 Chardonnay (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"Here's an herbal, floral Chardonnay from Northern Italy with a fresh, garden green intensity rounded off by soft notes of exotic fruit, citrus and peach blossom. The mouthfeel is lean and thin and the wine offers spicy freshness on the close."
US,86,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cimarossa 2007 Riva di Levante Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Smells a little funky and leathery, with an exaggeratedly sweet taste to the blackberries and cherries. The end impression is of a wine that's certainly ripe, but a little awkward, maybe even problematic. Seems best now."
US,91,55,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Milbrandt 2012 Sentinel Red (Wahluke Slope),"Cabernet Sauvignon (70%) makes up the majority of this wine along with Merlot (23%), Malbec (5%) and Petit Verdot. It's aromatically brooding, with notes of black fruit, toffee, moist soil and a floral top note. The palate pulls few punches with its rich, high-octane flavors and firm tannins but manages to keep it all in balance."
US,89,25,Merlot,red,Seven Hills 1997 Seven Hills Vineyard Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Blueberries, plums, and especially cherries, with a lovely, soft, beguiling bouquet of rose blossoms and chocolate. Crisply structured, with tight fruit, soft tannins, and a medium-weight, extended finish."
US,90,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Fritz 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),"Good for Fritz for holding this Cab back for a few years to let it mellow. It's still a pretty tannic, primary fruit-laden Cabernet, with briary blackberry, cherry, raspberry and red currant flavors. But judging by the firm tannins, it has an interesting future. Fine now, and should provide good drinking through 2012, at least."
Italy,90,22,Pinot Grigio,white,Nals Margreid 2009 Punggl Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),Punggl is a very expressive Pinot Grigio (one third of the wine is aged in large oak casks) that imparts fruity tones of peach and melon along with some spicier tones of pastry cream and vanilla. It shows good structure and silkiness in the mouth.
Italy,88,60,Sangiovese,red,Podere Scopetone 2010  Brunello di Montalcino,"The color on this is surprisingly evolved, showing more brick than garnet, while the nose offers underbrush, tobacco, fennel and red berry. The palate is closed and rather lean, offering raw red cherry, licorice, menthol and mineral alongside assertive but fine-grained tannins."
US,85,30,Chardonnay,white,Nitty Gritty 2011 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"A good, if fairly standard wine, showing all the popular Chardonnay elements. It's dry, crisp and creamy, with fruit and buttered toast flavors."
US,85,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Keuka Spring 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),"Blueberry, blackberry and cherry on the nose are followed by integrated but sophisticated flavors of cherry, dark fruit and spice.

US,96,54,Pinot Noir,red,Arista 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A best-of blend from several of the producer's vineyard sites, this wine explodes in flavor and complexity as though celebrating each site's individual beauty and potential.

US,90,55,Pinot Noir,red,Marimar Estate 2014 Doña Margarita Vineyard Chico's Run Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Dense and distinctively earthy, this wine offers ample tannin and oak, that are balanced by full-bodied ripeness. The core of its flavor profile is etched in baked strawberry, forest floor and a meaty tease that's unexpected, but welcome."
US,84,20,Pinot Noir,red,Hess Select 2013 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"Tart cherry pie, leather and a citrus twist show on the nose of this widely available wine. It's quite sour on the palate, with tart cranberry and unripe raspberry notes, with a touch of green orange and pencil lead to round it out."
US,84,10,Red Blend,red,Six Prong 2010 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"More than three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, the balance is Merlot and Cabernet Franc, with just pinches of Sangiovese (2%) and Zinfandel (1%), it plays on the savory and green end of the Cabernet spectrum, with notes of green olive and dried herbs along with cherry and chocolate and a tingly, gritty feel."
US,88,25,Merlot,red,Elevation Cellars 2011 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"All varietal, this wine leads with an unusual assortment of aromas that include anise, smoke, cigar box, vanilla and ripe blackberry. The flavors are tart and compact with a grainy feel. It provides intrigue but the variety seems to get lost."
US,82,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Wine Spots 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A rustic, everyday Cabernet, with enough blackberry and oak flavors to pass. It's rough in the mouth, with jagged tannins and an ashy note that's weird."
US,90,50,Red Blend,red,Spring Valley Vineyard 2005 Frederick Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The Frederick—a Bordeaux blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot, 5% Cab Franc and a splash of Petit Verdot—is entirely estate-grown, as are all of the Spring Valley wines. Located north of Walla Walla, in rolling wheat country, the vines attain a different set of flavors than anywhere else in the valley. It's an unusual combination of power (15.5% alcohol) and breed. Supple, sleek, mixing its black fruits with streaks of gun metal, iron and pencil lead, this is a wine that wants to tackle a prime rib, mano à mano."
US,92,42,Pinot Noir,red,Owen Roe 2006 The Kilmore Pinot Noir,"A sweet, supple, seductive Pinot that flirts with your palate. A bold display of ripe, sweet cherry fruit, followed by a flash of mint, a whiff of licorice, a streak of stone and a warm finish that suggests cola and sassafras.

US,89,62,Pinot Noir,red,Thomas George 2012 Cresta Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Mushroom and kirsch show through a wall of oak and thick tannin. This wine is still compressed and concentrated in flavor, with tea and tobacco providing a bittersweet end."
US,95,75,Pinot Noir,red,Rochioli 2010 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is Rochioli's estate Pinot—without a vineyard designation. It's a fabulous wine, showing the winery's signature power, complexity and balance. The flavors are rich, with notes of red berries, persimmons, red currants, bacon and cola. Absolutely delicious now, and it should gain traction and change interestingly over 6–8 years."

France,85,10,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Château de Landure 2005 Red (Minervois),"Medium weight with soft, dusty tannins, this wine is easily approachable now.

France,88,15,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Château Beaubois 2009 Expression Red (Costières de Nîmes),"Meaty and savory in style, with Syrah clearly playing a big part in the blend (70%; the other 30% is Grenache). This wine delivers authentic Southern Rhône Syrah flavors of asphalt, tapenade and espresso, devoid of any overt wood, remaining firm on the finish. Drink now–2014."

France,88,105,Riesling,white,Marc Kreydenweiss 2007 Le Château Kastelberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Another wacky Riesling from Marc Kreydenweiss, this one somehow works.

US,91,50,Chardonnay,white,Nickel & Nickel 2010 Truchard Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),"Sommeliers will love this Chardonnay for its lean, Chablis-like elegance. The lemon and passion fruit flavors stand alongside stony minerality and a leesy, sourdough bread tartness, while the brisk acidity makes the mouth water. Elegant rather than opulent, this gathers momentum as it warms in the glass."
US,87,18,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Morgan 2012 Cotes du Crow's Red (Monterey),"This smartly priced bend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah offers showy aromas of ollallieberry and rose petals.

France,88,25,Chardonnay,white,Vignerons des Terres Secrètes 2015 Croix-Jarrier  (Mâcon-Verze),"Reflecting the warm 2015 vintage, this is smooth and creamy. It has great fruitiness, recalling yellow fruit cut with a strong citrus streak. It's a wine to drink young, from late 2017."

US,83,13,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Healdsburg Ranches 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast),"Floral and a tad vegetative, this Cab is decent at first, but quickly turns disjointed and donut-y."
France,84,15,Pinot Noir,red,Clement et Florian Berthier 2014 Pinot Noir (Coteaux du Giennois),"While the wine is ripe, it does have a barnyard aroma that needs to blow away before it is ready to drink.

US,91,55,Chardonnay,white,Albatross Ridge 2013 Estate Chardonnay (Carmel Valley),"There's great backstory and foresight to this coastal-influenced project, and this bottling promises a worthy future. Aromas of crushed white rocks, lemon blossoms and lanolin lead into a clean, tight and bright palate. Excellent acidic sizzle presents flavors of squeezed lime, pomelo pith and Asian pear. It's a vineyard to watch."
US,84,12,Chardonnay,white,Hahn 2010 Nicky Hahn Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Sweet buttered toast, vanilla, pineapple jam and cinnamon spice flavors mark this simple little Chardonnay. It's made in the popular style that's delicious at first, and then palls."

With flavors of pear, apple and spice, it's crisp yet rich with just the smallest ounce of a barrel imprint, a match for roast chicken with herbs."
US,86,16,Syrah,red,Hogue 2012 Genesis Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Pepper, herb and dark fruit aromas lead to silky-feeling fruit and savory flavors. It doesn't stand up on its own but should fit in nicely at the dinner table."

Elegant and complex, it sends up subtle citrus scents, along with concentrated flavors of bush and berry, licorice, mocha and smoke. The details pile on and the finish lingers gracefully."
US,89,18,Chardonnay,white,Carmel Road 2010 Chardonnay (Monterey),"The underlying wine, before the winemaker put it into oak barrels, was delicious in tangerine and pineapple fruit, brightened with brilliantly crisp acidity and a fine, steely minerality. The oak, which is modest, adds a richer coating of buttered toast. A great price for a Chardonnay this drinkable."
US,84,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Shaw 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),"This wine has a nose of black fruits, mocha and toffee, and on the palate, warming spices, tart cherry and a touch of sweetness. The flavors aren't overly complex, but the wine is appealing, and the finish lingering."
US,94,30,White Blend,white,Carlisle 2015 Compagni Portis White (Sonoma Valley),"An old-vine field blend of Gewürztraminer, Trousseau Gris and Riesling, this vintage is tiny in production but boldly delicious in flavor and intent. Bright pretty aromatics of honeysuckle meet a balanced layering of creamy white peach, apple and wild vanilla, blessed by supportive acidity."
US,89,50,Chardonnay,white,Côte Bonneville 2014 Estate Bottled DuBrul Vineyard Chardonnay (Yakima Valley),"Appealing aromas of butterscotch, cream, spice, lees and tropical fruit lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors that bring a sense of richness but also delicacy. It shows a touch of warmth on the finish."
France,93,120,Pinot Noir,red,Camille Giroud 2008 Corton le Rognet  (Corton),"An impressively powerful wine, with packed acidity, sweet fruits and ripe tannins. The wine has great density, a dusty texture, the fruit powering through while preserving the relative austerity of the vintage."
US,86,25,Red Blend,red,Sebastiani 2011 Gravel Bed Red (Sonoma County),"Candied, jammy raspberry, cherry and white chocolate flavors mark this simple blend, based on Cabernet Sauvignon. Soft in tannins and acidity, it's easy to drink with burgers, lasagna, or for something different, figs and gorgonzola cheese."
US,91,33,Chardonnay,white,Keller Estate 2010 Oro de Plata Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Awesomely rich and ripe in Meyer lemon tart, orange zest and golden mango flavors, with oak and lees nuances that make it complex and interesting. The wine did not undergo malolactic fermentation, which gives the acidity the bite of a fresh green apple."
France,91,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château L'Escadre 2015 Grande Réserve  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"This juicy, fruity wine has a great backup of tannins. It has a smoky character, along with black currant fruit, lending an attractive balance. That fruit that will develop well. Drink from 2020."
Italy,89,30,Red Blend,red,Serpaia di Endrizzi 2011 Meria  (Maremma Toscana),"Made with 40% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Sangiovese and 5% Petit Verdot, this offers aromas of black cherry, leather and green bell pepper. The firm palate shows mature plum, vanilla and cedar alongside tightly wound tannins."
US,82,14,Chardonnay,white,Masterpiece 2012 Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),Watery pineapple and peach flavors have a heavy jacket of oak-like smokiness. Acidity provides a clean mouthfeel.
Italy,92,30,Red Blend,red,Occhipinti 2013 SP 68 Red (Terre Siciliane),"Very pretty aromas of rose, violet and perfumed berry lead the nose on this concentrated wine. The juicy palate offers blackberry, black cherry, licorice and white pepper alongside lithe, polished tannins and bright acidity. The succulent finish closes on a mineral note."
US,89,37,Syrah,red,Page Cellars 2005 Syrah (Red Mountain),"Purple/black and compact, this wine needs plenty of breathing time to reveal its layers. Klipsun vineyard fruit brings power and tannic muscle. The aromas are intriguing; a bit overripe and raisiny, but also offering truffle, smoked meat and burnt toast."
US,88,29,Chardonnay,white,McKahn 2015 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This is an elegant, pretty, lightly oaked white that's stony and savory with lemongrass, nutmeg and a strong crunch of green apple. Its depth of body and ripeness complement its more exotic elements."
US,83,10,Red Blend,red,Black Ink 2013 Red (California),"This medium-bodied red has a dark, inky color. It smells smoky, and offers flavors that are simple, grapy and very oaky. The texture is quite tannic."
US,88,17,Merlot,red,Chelsea Goldschmidt 2011 Merlot (Dry Creek Valley),"Polished and pretty, this Merlot delivers plenty of juicy cherry, red currant, mocha and toast flavors that are lovely to drink now. The wine is smooth and softly tannic—just what you want Merlot to be."
US,87,11,Merlot,red,Cycles Gladiator 2014 Merlot (Central Coast),"This wine and the entire brand often punch above their weight, in this case showing black cherry, cedar, dried dill, crushed graphite and peppercorns on the nose. The palate offers oregano and dill at first, but proves silky with dried cherry and cranberry fruit."
France,89,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Trois Moulins 2013  Haut-Médoc,"This is a dense wine, full of blackberries and ripe tannins. Juiciness gives the wine the fruitiness that's typical of the best of the vintage. Acidity at the end emphasizes the freshness. Drink from 2017."
US,93,97,Red Blend,red,Cayuse 2014 God Only Knows Red (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"Mostly Grenache, the aromas are vibrant, with notes of orange peel, stem, funk, smoked meat, white pepper, herb and crushed flower. It's light on its feet with abundant raspberry and earth flavors that draw out on the finish."
US,89,46,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,The Walls 2014 The Ramparts Red (Red Mountain),"This wine is half Grenache, with the balance Mourvèdre (31%), Syrah (14%) and Counoise. Lighter in color, it brings aromas of cranberry, cherry, spice, smoked meat and herb. The tart cranberry flavors are full bodied, showing a sense of purity and balance, pulling up a bit on the finish."
France,85,17,Riesling,white,Hugel 2000 Riesling (Alsace),"This Riesling has refinement, elegance and freshness without huge complexity. It is a wine to drink now and over the next four or five years."
US,86,45,Pinot Noir,red,Coho 2009 Stanly Ranch Pinot Noir (Los Carneros),"Tannic and dry, this turns twiggy and earthy on the finish. There's a burst of acid-inspired black-cherry flavor on the midpalate."
US,92,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Market Vineyards 2010 Basis Points Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Bordeaux-style blend is three fifths Cabernet Sauvignon, and one fifth each Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Winemaker Charlie Hoppes goes for a big-boned, oaky, deeply fruited style. The structure (tannins, acids, barrel flavors) is in place to support the dark, cassis fruit flavors. Highlights of violets, licorice and clean earth add welcome details."
France,87,15,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château des Tourtes 2016 Cuvée Classique  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"Baked apple aromas and crisp green fruit flavors set up this bright, fruity wine. With its lively character and juicy citrus notes, it could age a few more months. Save it for summer 2018."
US,89,25,Pinot Noir,red,Ousterhout 2013 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Peach-blush in color, this is a pretty, floral and aromatic wine, dry and delicious in peach and strawberry flavors. A hint of herbs marks the finish. Enjoy with a picnic, especially goat cheese and charcuterie."
US,89,24,Merlot,red,Mannina Cellars 2010 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This wine spent more than two years in barrel, yielding some grainy, textural tannins. The plummy fruit is backed with licorice, vanilla and black tea flavors, all nicely integrated."
US,84,10,Riesling,white,Perimeter 2014 Riesling (Washington),This medium-sweet offering has aromas of lime leaf and jasmine that lead to apricot and floral flavors. There's not a lot of complexity but it offers easy drinking enjoyment.
US,86,52,Chardonnay,white,Adelsheim 2011 Stoller Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Aggressively oaky, this does not seem to have yet integrated the substantial barrel flavors with the somewhat sour fruit. Stiff and woody, it was tasted repeatedly over 24 hours without showing much change."
US,87,36,Pinot Noir,red,Athair 2008 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a good Pinot Noir for drinking now. It has uncomplicated flavors of cherries, red plums and spices, and is dry and silky in the mouth. Acidity is high, giving it a tart bite throughout."
US,90,56,Syrah,red,Ascencion 2014 Mayhem Syrah (Paso Robles),"Tangy boysenberry and elderberry fruit shows on the nose of this sultry bottling, along with thyme, potpourri and licorice. The flavors are more cooked than fresh, recalling charred blackberry, dried blueberry, leather and licorice. It's a hearty wine that consumes the entire palate."
US,88,48,Pinot Noir,red,Sineann 2010 Resonance Vineyard Pinot Noir,"This young wine may need more time to reveal itself; though Resonance is proven as a top vineyard, here it seems shuttered and not yet woven together. Tart berry and cherry fruit turns sour in the finish, and does not display the power and depth of which it is capable."
US,89,15,Chardonnay,white,Toad Hollow 2012 Francine's Selection Chardonnay (Mendocino),"One of the original unoaked California Chardonnays, it's fresh, fruity, clean and perhaps better than ever. It smells and tastes like ripe apple, lemon and a hint of pineapple. The balance of moderate ripeness and mouth-cleansing acidity is right on the money."
France,87,29,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Grand Enclos du Château de Cérons 2005  Cérons,"Cérons, next door to Sauternes, produces a lighter version of those dessert wines. This wine, with its characteristic honey sweetness, is edging toward toffee, the baked apple flavors already tamed by a few years aging. The core of botrytis dryness is now well integrated, suggesting the wine is ready to drink."
US,96,115,Pinot Noir,red,Wayfarer 2014 Paige's Ridge Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Floral in aromas and yet darkly savory in cherry and clove, this full-bodied wine holds layered acidity and balanced oak at its core. It hails from one block of the vineyard and spent time in entirely new French oak. Baked raspberry tart finds a happy companion in the richness of maple and velvety tannin. Drink now through 2024."
US,87,17,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Esser 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Monterey County),"Black plum, savory peppercorns and smoke make for a very acceptable nose on this widely available twist-top bottling. The flavors are very juicy and the mouthfeel quite creamy, with slightly sweet flavors of ripe black fruit sure to please the masses."
Italy,92,160,Red Blend,red,Tenuta di Biserno 2012 Biserno Red (Toscana),"Coconut, black currant, toasted oak and grilled bell pepper lead the nose on this blend of Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. The polished, full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, raspberry, licorice and espresso framed in silky tannins."
US,82,12,Riesling,white,Mirassou 2010 Riesling (California),"So sweet, it's basically a dessert wine, with simple, sugary flavors of oranges, apricots and vanilla."
Italy,87,16,Pinot Grigio,white,Primosic 2014 Santa Lucia Pinot Grigio (Collio),"Gold with copper hues, this opens with aromas of wildflower, tangerine zest and a whiff of crushed stone. The vibrant palate offers rennet apple, lime, ginger drop and a hint of mineral alongside mouthwatering acidity."
Italy,91,40,Sangiovese,red,Tolaini 2011 Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),"Truffle, ripe berry, plum, oak-driven spice, espresso and leather aromas lead the nose. The firm palate delivers dried black cherry, raisin, licorice and tobacco alongside tightly knit tannins. It closes on a note of grilled herb. Drink 2016–2021."
US,96,70,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cayuse 2008 Widowmaker Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Superb sculpture and definition in this compact and lightly funky evocation of pure Cabernet Sauvignon. The deep, dense, super ripe berry flavors are framed within a bouquet of dried herbs, pepper, mineral, astringent tannins, and a crisp mix of earth, wood and plant flavors. Superb length and ageability."
US,89,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Spann Vineyards 2011 The Classic Four Red (California),"This is complex and compelling. A spicy, minty, thyme-like character comes out in the aroma and continues in the flavor, most likely from some new barrels used in aging the wine. It's an attractive characteristic, and complements the bright cherry flavors, medium body and quite firm tannins."
US,93,48,Chardonnay,white,Stony Hill 2014 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"This producer is well respected for its long reputation of making ageworthy whites and this vintage is no exception, a bright, complex and nutty expression of pear and ginger cookie. Textured and restrained, it shows a wealth of structure and lemony acidity. Cellar it away until 2024 if you can."
US,90,32,Pinot Noir,red,Lange 2009 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Young and loaded with primary fruit flavors—fresh-picked cherries right off the tree, red delicious apples, just-made cranberry sauce—this is lovely now but built for the long term. The 13.6% alcohol listed is verified by the juicy acidity and just a touch of herb in the back of the finish."
US,90,23,Chardonnay,white,Shannon Ridge 2013 High Elevation Chardonnay (Lake County),"It's a grand, full-flavored wine that pulls together ripe, focused pear and honey flavors. Buttery, spicy oak nuances beef up the palate impression and run through the finish. For all its body and oaky spice, it doesn't get heavy."
US,87,46,Syrah,red,Eponymous 2010 Syrah (Napa Valley),"So ripe and sweet in raspberry jam, cherry pie and plum sauce flavor, it makes it hard to appreciate the other qualities of this Syrah. It also has lovely, soft tannins and a long, spicy finish. Doesn't leave much to the imagination, but it sure is a tasty wine."
US,84,40,Zinfandel,red,The Industrial 2009 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Soft, hot in alcohol and sweet, this simple wine tastes like melted raspberry and cherry jam."
Italy,87,27,Sangiovese,red,La Fiorita 2014  Rosso di Montalcino,"Darkly colored, this wine opens with aromas of menthol, espresso and plum. The one-dimensional palate is surprisingly dense for the vintage, offering black cherry, espresso and clove alongside polished tannins."
US,85,38,Zinfandel,red,Seghesio 2011 Old Vine Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"A simple hamburger or pasta dish is your best bet to pair with this good, straightforward Zin. It's dry, acidic and rather thin with wild berry, raisin, cola and oak flavors."
US,91,22,Syrah,red,Morgan 2014 G 17 Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"A screaming deal from Dan Lee and company, this dynamic Syrah shows plush blackberry, vanilla and caramel aromas. There's buoyant red and purple fruit on the palate, from boysenberry to black raspberry, kept fresh with lively acidity and accented with lavender and thyme."
US,86,45,Pinot Noir,red,Boedecker Cellars 2005 Momtazi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is quite light, almost ephemeral, with tart raspberry and red licorice flavors and a strong metallic/mineral streak. It is delicately made, and interesting, but comparable to a simple Bourgogne rather than a wine priced at this level."
France,91,36,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Domaine le Galantin 2006 Red (Bandol),"This is a delicious wine that's ready to drink while keeping a good sense of its austere structure. It has weight, richness and a juicy black-fruit character. The finish is bright with acidity. Not for aging."
US,85,24,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Pippin Hill Farm 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Monticello),"Buttery and nutty notes are the lead aromas. The palate offers a succulent white-apricot note, and the acids become charged toward the finish."
France,89,43,Chardonnay,white,Pierre Moncuit NV Hugues de Coulmet Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"From the small Champagne region around Sézanne, this is a rounded, mouthfilling Chardonnay. It has ripe citrus and orange fruit flavors with a touch of apricot. It's a classic apéritif style."
US,87,15,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Archgate Cellars 2014 Reserve Bottling Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"Full-bodied and smooth in texture, this generous-tasting wine has lots of ripe plum flavors and sweet-seeming oak accents."
US,90,16,Pinot Gris,white,Rex Hill 2006 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"Nicely made, this enters the palate with confidence and strikes a juicy pose, layered with white peach, apricot and pear. The fruit flavors gather strength in the midpalate, dappling in bits of baking spice, cinnamon and custard, and then gently fading into a smooth, supple finish. Classy winemaking here; this is a lovely, fruit-driven bottle with extra dimensions of texture and spice."
US,90,40,Chardonnay,white,Alysian 2010 Floodgate Vineyard Clone 95 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This Chardonnay is made in a leaner, lower alcohol style. In place of the fat, rich fruit of some Chards you'll find a tart minerality, with the citrus and peach flavors containing hints of sweet green peas. Gains extra points for elegance."
US,84,26,Chardonnay,white,Gundlach Bundschu 2007 Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"Super-fruity, with jammy flavors of pineapples, green apples, peaches and spicy golden mango. A bit sugary sweet, too."
US,84,22,Zinfandel,red,Horse & Plow 2009 Testa Vineyard Zinfandel (Mendocino),"Horse & Plow turns out so many lovely wines it's heartbreaking not to include this one in the mix. It was sourced from one of the great organic Mendocino vineyards, old vines no less, but there just wasn't much there, the wine tasting tight without much fruit."
US,89,18,White Blend,white,Borra 2012 Artist Series White (Lodi),"Borra winemaker Markus Niggli, a Swiss native, has gone back to his roots for this innovative blend of 85% Kerner and 15% Riesling, proving that some of the best experimentation in California is happening in places like Lodi right now. Full of lively acidity, this wine is crisp, soft, sparkling with lime, apple, lychee and kiwi, easy to enjoy on a summer's day or any other day."
US,92,70,Pinot Noir,red,Lange 2014 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Still tasting quite young, this potent Pinot brings a dark streak of smoke and a splash of citrus to its core black-fruit flavors. The tannins are stiff and carry a hint of stem. Give this some further bottle age, and drink it between 2018 and 2028."
US,92,29,Pinot Noir,red,Aberrant Cellars 2014 Confero Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Comprised of multiple clones from five different vineyards, this exceptional value includes a rich cohesive core of purple fruits, amplified with barrel flavors of toasted coconut and bright spice. Everything is beautifully focused across the full palate, and even after being open for a full 24 hours, the wine tastes fresh and delicious."
US,88,40,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Henry Earl 2010 Homesteader Red (Red Mountain),"Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon take the lead on this Bordeaux-style blend that brings overt notes of vanilla, coconut and dark fruit, with the barrel notes riding high. It's full bodied and rich with the oak overtaking the varietal flavors but still offering appeal."
US,91,30,Chardonnay,white,Varner 2001 Amphitheater Block Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Here's a rich, round Chard that delivers with its ripe, mouth-filling flavors. White peach, papaya, spicy fig, smoke, buttered toast, vanilla are accompanied by crisp, clean acidity. The intense finish lasts for a long time."
US,89,23,Chardonnay,white,Milbrandt 2012 The Estates Chardonnay (Ancient Lakes),"A surprisingly ripe wine from this generally cool vineyard, it shows notes of toast, buttery spice, vanilla and tropical fruit. It's medium-plus bodied, creamy in feel with a tart finish."
Italy,87,19,Red Blend,red,Carpineto 2014  Chianti Classico,"Lively and straightforward, this opens with aromas of red berry, moist earth and a hint of chopped herb. The tart, easygoing palate offers juicy Marasca cherry and a dash of white pepper alongside zesty acidity."
US,86,15,White Blend,white,Waterbrook 2008 Mélange Blanc White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Off-dry with a candied orange character, this is indeed a mélange, including portions of seven different white wine grapes. It's an interesting wine, though might prove a bit challenging to match to food. Perhaps a curry?"
US,87,17,Zinfandel,red,Sobon Estate 2007 Rocky Top Zinfandel (Amador County),"Give this young, fruity wine a few years in the cellar. The flavors are all primary blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam. The tannins and a touch of espresso bitterness might easily help this Zin develop through 2012."
Italy,88,25,Red Blend,red,Erik Banti 2004 Poggio Maestrino Annosesto Red (Toscana),"This dark, concentrated wine offers flavors of blackberry preserves, peanuts, hickory and smoked barbecue sauce. The wine is succulent and slightly sweet."
US,88,55,Merlot,red,Brian Carter Cellars 2013 One Olsen Vineyard Merlot (Yakima Valley),"The aromas of cocoa and dark raspberry are speckled with light barrel accents. The red-fruit flavors are ripe and generous, dipping in the middle before coming back together on the elegant finish."
France,86,18,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Château d'Or et de Gueules 1998 Cuvée Prestige Red (Costières de Nîmes),"Blueberry fruit mingles with cinnamon-tinged oak spice on the nose and palate of this offering. There's even enough depth and complexity to make it more than a simple quaff, worthy of washing down simply roasted chicken perhaps."
US,88,26,Chardonnay,white,Hearst Ranch 2014 Glacier Ridge Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Sharp aromas of jasmine, green-apple rind and crisp pear flesh give a greener twist to the nose of this bottling by the sHearst family. The palate is framed by tangy, pinpoint acidity, showing lime rind, Anjou pear and squeezed orange flavors that leave the tongue tingling."
US,84,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Osprey's Dominion 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (North Fork of Long Island),"Red currant, sweet cedar and warming spices on the nose lead into like flavors on the palate. Slightly tart with a smoky edge, the wine is overall a good everyday sip. Pair with pastas, hamburgers, lamb."
US,94,45,Pinot Noir,red,Bonaccorsi 2010 Sebastiano Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Astonishingly deep in flavor, offering an explosion of the ripest cherries and raspberries imaginable. Additional notes of toasty oak, brown sugar and cinnamon spice make this Pinot irresistible, while the acidity brings all the richness to life. Drink now–2016."
US,89,38,Pinot Noir,red,Westrey 2010 Justice Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"This AVA's typical minerality underscores this full-bodied wine, which bears flavors of spice, berry and black cherry cola."
US,88,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Peloton 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),"Bone dry and crisp, this Sauvignon Blanc shows fresh, savory flavors of lemons, limes and grapefruits, with richer notes of pineapples, vanilla bean and honeysuckle. A firm minerality helps add structure and finesse. It's a great restaurant wine, especially at this price, but will be hard to find, with only 140 cases produced."
US,87,36,Chardonnay,white,Sonoma-Cutrer 2007 Les Pierres Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Dry and crisp, with a fine, clean minerality, this Chardonnay is dominated by the vanilla and toast of oak. The underlying wine shows pineapple, Asian pear and lime flavors. It's elegant, but a little thin."
France,84,10,Merlot,red,Gabriel Meffre 2015 La Châsse Merlot (Vin de France),"The is a soft, gentle wine with ripe berry fruit. Minimal tannins are embedded in its fruitiness and rounded texture. Drink now."
US,84,18,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Billsboro 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),"Big spice and blackberry/cherry aromas start this wine out right, and on the palate, a rustic underlay of tobacco and pepper adds character. Good structure and acidity add a food-friendly edge. A wine that is easy to drink and well made."
US,88,28,Chardonnay,white,HKG 2011 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Grassy dill and citrus flavors give this Chardonnay a Sauvignon Blanc-style leanness, but it's balanced with notes of buttered toast and vanilla from new French oak. Brisk with acidity, it's the perfect wine to drink with scallops."
US,90,35,Merlot,red,:Nota Bene 2009 Conner Lee Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Only in Washington can you find pure varietal, single-vineyard Merlot at this price that shows such power and depth. Aged in American oak barrels with French oak stave inserts, it displays plenty of smoky caramel and coconut flavors, but the fruit is there in good proportion. This wine is sure to find plenty of admirers; if only more than just 58 cases had been produced."
US,87,38,Pinot Noir,red,Bailiwick 2012 Silver Pines Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),"This wine opens with a curious waft of pastry-like vanilla cream underneath cherry tart and a squeeze of citrus. Oaky on the back palate it struggles to find itself in the glass, the fruit trying to make its way through the thickness of tannin. Letting the wine air a bit should help."
US,83,50,Pinot Noir,red,Toulouse 2011 Estate Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"The color—a rather light garnet going to brownish—suggests an older wine or one made with rustic methods, and the flavors travel the same path. An earthy quality shades modest cherry flavors, while hints of clove and cinnamon add complexity."
US,88,45,Pinot Noir,red,Rubinna 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine offers baked flavors of red raspberry, black cherry and grapy plum. It finds its balance between juicy approachability and a swat of tannin that provides depth and body. It finishes ripe and with a suggestion of char."
France,89,13,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Vidal-Fleury 2012 Red (Côtes du Rhône),"This mouthfilling blend of 65% Grenache, 20% Syrah, 10% Mourvèdre and 5% Carignan features ample cherry fruit, with some chocolaty richness on the palate and hints of bay leaf and anise. It's bouncy and fresh, showing enough tannin in the finish to think it will stand up well to grilled burgers or chops."
US,89,58,Pinot Noir,red,Gracianna 2012 Mercedes Riverblock Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The vineyard is on Westside Road, in the warmer part of the valley. The wine is gentle, balanced and immediately likeable for its array of raspberries, cherries and cola. Heat from alcohol makes it a little ungainly, and may limit ageability. Drink through 2019."
US,94,60,Pinot Noir,red,Siduri 2015 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"The nose on this bottling from the iconic vineyard co-owned by the Pisoni and Franscioni families is quite sultry, with lots of violet and purple-flower aromas as well as mulberry, black raspberry, forest floor and grilled meat. The earthy fruit flavors of mulberry are strong on the sip, playing well with the loamy soils, dusty minerality, stiffer tannins and persistent acidity. A deep and layered wine."
Italy,87,16,Chardonnay,white,Borgo Maragliano NV Brut Chardonnay (Piedmont),"Fresh and easy, with bright acidity and steady effervescence, this Chardonnay-based sparkler would pair well with fried finger foods or appetizers. The wine is easygoing and refreshing."
US,88,38,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Dumas Station 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Aromas of dried cranberry, raspberry, vanilla, dill and spice are followed by velvety fruit and barrel flavors that show a lovely sense of balance. It provides plenty of interest but the barrel notes seem a bit too predominant."
US,88,15,Syrah,red,Charles Smith 2013 Boom Boom! Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas of blue and red fruit are direct and appealing, with dried herbs providing a grace note. The currant flavors are plump with lightly grainy tannins backing them up."
US,88,24,Pinot Noir,red,Torii Mor 2010 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This light, pretty, blended Pinot Noir trumps the winery's pricier cuvées in 2010. Strawberry candy fruit flavors are enhanced with light streaks of toast and baking spices, and hints of rose petals elevate the finish. A simple, delightful bottle for near term enjoyment."
US,90,40,Chardonnay,white,Argyle 2015 Nuthouse Master Series Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills),"Richer and oakier than the regular Argyle Chardonnay, this conveys flavors of Honey Crisp apple, framed with a palate-pleasing toastiness. It's balanced and already drinking in a prime window. Enjoy it now through 2020."
US,87,25,Red Blend,red,Underground Wine Project 2014 Idle Hands Red (Red Mountain),"This wine is 90% Syrah and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of plum, smoke, orange peel and dried fruit are followed by a sweet full-bodied palate. It packs a big wallop but could use a bit more acid to balance out the abundance of fruit."
France,93,85,Pinot Noir,red,Bouchard Père & Fils 2006 Caillerets Premier Cru Ancienne Cuvée Carnot  (Volnay),"The richness of the fruit from Caillerets is so evident in this scrumptious wine. With its big, bold black fruits, it has sweetness, a soft, generous texture and evocative perfumes. It is so delicious and ready to drink now, that even the acidity that shows through has a hard time reminding us that this wine should age as well."
France,90,20,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Château de Nages 2011 JT Red (Costières de Nîmes),"This blend of 88% Syrah and 12% Mourvèdre is crisp, crunchy and direct, delivering brambly, blackberry fruit spiced with a touch of licorice. This is tart and firm without being particularly tannic, so enjoy it over the next few years."
Italy,94,160,Red Blend,red,G.A. Rossi di Medelana 2007 Lupicaia Red (Toscana),"A blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of mature blackberries, blueberries, cedar, aromatic dried herbs and black pepper. On the smooth palate, notes of exotic spice, licorice, menthol and espresso accent the core of dried black cherry. It's well balanced, with velvety tannins and surprising freshness for what was a torrid vintage."
US,90,28,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Sleight of Hand 2013 The Conjurer Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot saw just a kiss (15%) of new French oak, putting the fruit aromas of plum, blueberry, cherry and herb at the fore. The coffee and berry flavors are lighter in style backed by a firm squeeze of slightly gritty tannins."
US,85,23,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Olema 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"This affordably priced county wine is simple in structure, showcasing clove, cedar and black currant flavors on the full-bodied, concentrated palate."
US,93,70,Pinot Noir,red,Reuling Vineyard 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Reuling is humming its way toward continued greatness in working with its own coveted fruit, crafting a coming-together of earthy fruit and lush texture. This vintage is dark ruby in color, classic in complex forest floor and wild strawberry layered over flowery perfume and a streak of spice. The imprint of oak and girth is still evolving, and the structure is there to cellar from 2017–2021."
US,88,24,Red Blend,red,Mari 2013 Scriptorium Bestiary Red (Old Mission Peninsula),"As a side project alongside the Mari Vineyards wines, this is the first release of winemaker Sean O'Keefe's Scriptorium line. Blending Blaufränkisch, Zweigelt and Lagrein, this cool-climate red boasts dark cherry and raspberry laced with pink peppercorn and cedar oil. There's ample concentration of fruit on the palate, with lively acidity and crushed stone keeping things light."
US,84,38,Zinfandel,red,Maryhill 2005 Proprietor's Reserve Zinfandel (Columbia Valley (WA)),"If you are a fan of Rosenblum Zins, you might want to try this Washington Zin, styled in the same 16.4% alcohol mode. It's got plenty of syrupy berry fruit, and some very chocolaty streaks as well, but the tannins are earthy and still have a bitter finish to them. The winery's regular Zin is far better."
US,85,25,Chardonnay,white,Newton 2012 Red Label Chardonnay (Napa County),"Tropical fruit, peach, pear, green apple and lime flavors mark this fruity Chardonnay. It has prominent vanilla and buttered toast flavors, with a nice hit of acidity for balance."
US,91,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Tamarack Cellars 2011 Ciel du Cheval Reserve Red (Red Mountain),"Cabernet Sauvignon (42%) takes the lead with the rest equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of dried herbs, flowers, graphite and dark fruit lead to supple, layered dark fruit flavors back by the grip of dry tannins. Drink now."
US,85,12,Riesling,white,Covey Run 2008 Reserve Late Harvest Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Despite the reserve and late harvest designations, this fits in more comfortably with a standard, off-dry Washington Riesling. The 4% residual sugar is muted by good acidity and firm pear and peach fruit. There's some phenolic bite in the finish, and a hint of plastic."
US,83,30,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Loft 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (North Coast),"This medium-bodied wine is dry and crisp, showing light dried herb, celery and nut aromas. Lively citrus flavors are tinged with earthiness and a tangy texture."
US,93,52,Pinot Noir,red,Ancien 2014 Fiddlestix Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This cleanly made wine has potential to live long in the cellar. Intensely focused aromas of black raspberry and black plum combine with crushed asphalt and a touch of purple flowers on the nose. The tightly wound palate slowly reveals tart boysenberry, char and pine resin, flavors that the firm structure will reveal even more deliciously with time. Drink 2018–2029."
US,86,11,Riesling,white,Hogue 2011 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Medium sweet (listed at 24g/L residual sugar), this includes 7% Gewürztraminer in the blend. Lime and lime skin are the first sniff responders, with more citrus and wet stone flavors following. Despite the sugar, it's a rather tart tasting wine, suitable for a wide variety of spicy Asian fare."
US,86,35,Merlot,red,Long Island Merlot Alliance 2008 Merliance Merlot (Long Island),"The nose is a tad fleshy with ripe red-fruit and sweet spice notes, but the palate is crisp with striking acidity and hints of green leaves and forest floor. It tastes fine now, with ripe, chalky tannins, but it should hold well until at least 2015."
France,87,15,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château de Bonhoste 2011  Bordeaux Blanc,"Tight, crisp and mineral driven, this wine has citrus fruits and a steely texture, demonstrating that it needs to age for a year."
US,83,24,Chardonnay,white,Stephen Ross 2007 Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"Sweet and simple, like a blend of pineapple juice, pear juice and lemonade. But the wine is clean and crisp."
US,92,80,Red Blend,red,Sextant 2011 Portolan Red (Paso Robles),"This blend of 50% Syrah, 23% Petite Sirah, 17% Mourvèdre and 10% Grenache presents a delicious strawberry cake nose, backed up with dried purple flowers and cigar box backbone. On the palate, elegant purple fruits are laced with leather and pepper, finishing with a cleansing tartness."
US,92,85,Pinot Noir,red,Archery Summit 2013 Renegade Ridge Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This vineyard was developed between 10 and 20 years ago. The maturing vines deliver a supple yet firm wine, anchored in a core of candy cherry fruit. Aromatic and flavorful highlights of cinnamon, clove and candied orange are also in play, along with a subtle hint of herb."
US,93,40,Pinot Noir,red,Walt 2010 La Brisa Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"Is it just a simple, delicious drink-me-now Pinot? Or is it actually complex and worthy of pairing with the best foods? It's both. Front-loaded with raspberry purée, smoked butter and oak flavors, it has subtle layers of mushroom and dried pine that lift it into an ethereal place. Who cares if it will age? It's drop-dead gorgeous now. Char-broiled salmon could be your best pairing."
US,90,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Carden 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Blended with 25% Cabernet Franc, this engaging wine has aromas of herbs and blackberries. The fruit shows a real sense of vibrancy and purity, laden with tart, cranberry-like acidity and firm, lightly chalky tannins. Just a baby now, it should be at its peak in 2025."
France,90,70,Chardonnay,white,Lallier NV Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"From fruit grown in Avize and Aÿ, this pure Chardonnay is mineral textured while also full of ripe fruit. Ripe apples contrast with zingy acidity that gives a good lift at the end. This is a delicious wine to drink now."
Italy,88,40,Red Blend,red,Duemani 2006 Altrovino Red (Toscana),"Altrovino is a 50-50 blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc that opens with intense aromas of black fruit, spice, tobacco and smooth black chocolate. In the mouth, this wine offers richness and a silky, long finish."
Italy,86,30,Sangiovese,red,San Giacomo 2012  Rosso di Montalcino,"Aromas of graphite, subtle oak and ripe woodland berries carry over to the palate, along with notes of vanilla and espresso. It has an almost sugary-sweet finish. It's already extremely accessible so drink now."
US,87,15,Sangiovese,red,Pedroncelli 2008 Alto Vineyards Sangiovese (Dry Creek Valley),"This is one of the more drinkable Sangioveses in California, and while it's no blockbuster, it does have a certain charm. Dry and balanced, it has easy to like cherry, tobacco, bacon and spice flavors."
US,84,15,Merlot,red,181 2008 Merlot (Lodi),"Soft and simple, with slightly sweet pie-filling flavors of cherries and mocha. A decent, everyday wine for picnics, barbecue and such."
US,84,28,Zinfandel,red,Perry Creek 2006 Altitude 2401 Fair Play Farms Zinfandel (El Dorado),"This is a soft, ripely sweet Zinfandel that will be nice to sip with barbecue or baked ham. It's rich in blackberry and cherry jam, mocha, anise and pepper flavors."
US,94,48,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Paix Sur Terre 2014 Either Side of the Hill Glenrose Vineyard Red (Adelaida District),"Brooding and powerful, this ripe and regionally representative blend of 85% Syrah and 15% Mourvèdre shows caramelized blueberry, chocolate sauce, crème brûlée and coffee bean on the nose. It hits the palate with density that masks the fruit at first, and then unleashes waves of fudge, elderberry, blackberry, licorice and jet-black coffee laced with black cassis."
US,86,10,Red Blend,red,Rare 2014 Purple Blend Red (California),"Very fruity and a little spicy, this medium- to full-bodied wine has a smooth texture, nicely concentrated black-cherry and blueberry flavors and a good sense of layering and length."
US,94,59,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Woodward Canyon 2012 Artist Series #21 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington),"This wine has deeply concentrated yet focused and spicy purple-fruit tones. It's generously endowed with notes of tobacco, licorice, mineral and pepper. The highlights keep piling on through a finish that seems to run for several minutes. This bold wine is enjoyable now but should also cellar well through 2020."
US,88,32,Chardonnay,white,Talley 2011 Monte Sereno Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Oak and sur lie yeastiness play a big part in this dry Chardonnay's personality. The fruit veers toward tart lemons and limes, with just a hint of nectarine and guava. It feels tight and young in the mouth, so give it until 2014 to start expressing itself."
US,85,28,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Delfino 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Umpqua Valley),"This is a light simple red, without particular varietal character. It's much like an inexpensive California Merlot—fine for every day drinking, generic and unassuming."
US,84,20,Merlot,red,Trig Point 2007 Diamond Dust Vineyard Merlot (Alexander Valley),"This dry, soft wine has slightly herbal flavors of sage that ground the ripe blackberries and cherries. It's a pleasant wine, although it's rather rustic and calls for everyday fare."
US,88,36,Zinfandel,red,Peachy Canyon 2010 Snow Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"This is Peachy Canyon's 100% Zinfandel, unblended, and it's a true expression of the variety, Paso Robles style. That means it's softly voluptuous and almost to the point of overripeness, with blackberry, raisin and spice flavors. Drink now."
Italy,89,55,Sangiovese,red,Mocali 2012 Vigna delle Raunate  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Loaded with red berry, chopped herb and dark spice aromas, this zesty, medium-bodied red offers dried cherry, raspberry, ground pepper and clove flavors. It's savory but straightforward and not very persistent."
US,92,80,Red Blend,red,Monte De Oro 2011 Vigna Vicini Reserve Red (Temecula Valley),"This 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah comes from adjacent blocks planted in 2002. It was aged in new French oak for 42 months, so the nose delivers rich aromas of sugar plum, gingerbread spice and black-cherry syrup. The palate is quite dry, with a dark-chocolate bitterness, woody juniper flavors and firm, structured tannins that give depth to the black-plum core and vanilla-pie-crust touch on the finish."
US,89,32,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Ash Hollow 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, all estate grown. Winemaker Steve Clifton handles the high (over 15%) alcohol well, and the wine feels full and balanced, but not fat or tiring. The fruit is a pleasant mix of raspberry, cherry and currant; with bright acids and firm tannins to back it up."
US,87,14,Riesling,white,Keuka Spring 2010 Riesling (Finger Lakes),"While dainty in structure, this light-footed Riesling is intense and concentrated, with ripe stone-fruit and tangerine flavors. Nervy lemon-lime--like acidity and shades of slate and steel add depth and balance."
US,85,18,Riesling,white,McGregor 2012 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Ripe peach and floral aromas waft from this sprightly off-dry Riesling. A hint of pressed apple lends a savory feel to the mid palate, but it finishes briskly with a squirt of lemon and lime."
US,85,32,Merlot,red,Silverado 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Dry and tannic, but a bit raw and hard in the mouth, and doesn't seem to be an ager. You'll find modest flavors of black currants, cherries and cola. Drink now."
US,88,35,Merlot,red,Silverado 2009 Mt. George Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"This bottling by the respected Silverado winery has been consistent over the years. The 2009 vintage is unsurprisingly quite good and drinkable, with elegance. It's a soft wine, with a creamy mouthfeel framing black cherry, mocha and oak flavors. Ready now."
US,86,15,Red Blend,red,Steelhead Vineyards 2010 Red (North Coast),"This is a straightforward blend of Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Syrah, offering briary, jammy black-fruit and leather flavors, finishing with a splash of vanilla."
US,90,40,Syrah,red,Kessler-Haak 2013 Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),"Quite vibrant and floral on the nose, this shows deep blackberry and both dried and fresh purple-flower elements as well as a baked berry pastry. The flavors are well integrated on the palate, where cooked blackberries in a vanilla pie crust combine with juicy strawberry, peppercorns and rosemary spice."
US,81,12,White Blend,white,Kitchen Sink NV Winemaker's Reserve White (California),"Sweet, simple and fruity, with peach and apricot jam flavors. The finish is bitter in fruit pit tannins."
France,84,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Roustaing 2011  Bordeaux,"Light and already fruity, this wine features attractive black-currant flavors, bright acidity and soft tannins. Ready to drink."
US,88,65,Pinot Noir,red,Alexander-Smith 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This wine may have potential in the years to come, but is still searching for its soul at this young age. Aromas of dried black cherries and strawberries meet with black tea, juniper and a touch of tar on the nose. The palate is framed in a foamy acidity, offering plum and squeezed blackberry fruit, but dominated with a very herbal character that's still integrating."
Italy,92,33,Red Blend,red,Campo al Mare 2009 Baia al Vento  (Bolgheri Superiore),"From producers Ambrogio & Giovanni Folonari, Baia al Vento (90% Merlot with small percentages of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot) shows ripe fruit, plum, blackberry preserves and cherry backed by cured meat, tobacco and dried rosemary. The wine is round and soft with bright points of acidity that keeps it balanced."
US,91,42,Pinot Noir,red,Halcon 2014 Wentzel Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Very tasty and well-balanced, this wine is fresh, smooth and easy to enjoy, and it stayed that way for two days after tasting. It has delicious red cherry and cranberry flavors that blend nicely with the lively texture and medium body. Just the thing when a slightly lighter, more refreshing red is called for."
US,87,20,Merlot,red,Kiona 1998 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is still the current release. A very hot vintage in Washington, it leads with a Portlike nose of raisins and prunes; follows with soft, ripe and roasted flavors. The tannins are deep and earthy. Drink now. —P.G."
US,91,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Robert Hall 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Fudge, smoked blackberries and a shred of asphalt show on the nose of this bottling from the longtime Paso producer. The density is seriously thick but not overblown, with brighter cherry and fresh blueberry fruit elements that lean against a tannic edge, flecked with black pepper and espresso bean."
US,87,30,Chardonnay,white,Hawley 2013 Hoot Owl Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),"Intensely concentrated, this wine offers minerally petrol and hazelnut, particularly on the nose. A salinity marks it on the medium-bodied palate, giving it an intriguing edge before finishing in a squeeze of lemon."
US,86,25,Syrah,red,Frenchman's Gulch 2008 Syrah (Washington),"Sourced from the excellent Lewis Vineyard, this toasty, chewy Syrah displays black cherry fruit against a strong background of vanilla. At first it seems tart to the point of being almost sour, but as it breathes, the oak mutes some of the acid and balances it out."
US,83,35,Zinfandel,red,Benessere 2013 Black Glass Estate Vineyard Zinfandel (St. Helena),"Dark red in color, though fraying, like an older wine, this lacks in aroma. Otherwise it's a straightforward expression of blackberry, tar and leather."
US,90,28,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Knight Hill 2010 StoneTree Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Wahluke Slope),"100% varietal with all of the fruit coming from StoneTree Vineyard, it's barrel-forward, with notes of fresh brewed coffee, dark chocolate and cherry. It starts out lighter in style before fleshing out over time with a pleasing interplay between the oak and fruit flavors. Soft tannins and tart acidity provide the frame."
US,91,50,Red Blend,red,Krupp Brothers 2008 Veraison Red (Napa Valley),"Smooth in tannins with a nice bite of acidity, this shows rich flavors of blackberry, cherry and spice, with a touch of mocha that gives it an apparent sweetness. It's a Bordeaux blend with some Syrah, grown in the famed Stagecoach Vineyard."
US,86,30,Pinot Noir,red,Second Growth 2015 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Young and forward, this pleasant wine brings black-cherry fruit front and center—a good start, but it doesn't really develop any further. It just does a quick and quiet fade out."
US,92,32,Syrah,red,Stevens 2005 Black Tongue Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Dineen fruit, in a singular vintage, equals spectacular Syrah. This has it all going on—rich, luscious flavors of berries and cherries, wrapped (soaked!) in chocolate, elevated with zippy acidity and smooth and creamy as fresh-churned butter. Seductive doesn't begin to cover it. You could take a bath in this stuff. Yum!"
US,91,34,Syrah,red,Rendarrio Vineyards 2014 The Lost Ones Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Fairly shy aromas of blackberry juice, uncracked peppercorns and dried lilacs show on the nose of this bottling by Ryan Render. Cooked meat flavors are evident on the sip, including bacon fat and charred beef, and there is a rich blackberry-sauce component as well. Cracked pepper also arises, making this a Syrah that will please many palates."
US,89,45,Pinot Noir,red,Scratch 2012 KW Ranch Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"With scents reminiscent of an early morning hike through a foggy forest, it features aromas of cola, sassafras and a damp, earthen funk. It hits the palate with a medium body, delivering some violet florals at first and, with enough swishing, finishing on sanguine flavors of red meat."
US,95,55,Chardonnay,white,Gary Farrell 2013 Rochioli Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"An intensity of petrol-like oakiness on the nose of this wine suggests a youthful coiling that's yet to unravel. Still, plenty of promise is revealed, from robust yet floral elements of golden apple and honey to the effusive back notes of peach. Medium bodied, it finishes crisp and creamy, an expert combination of strength and elegance. Drink now through 2020."
France,88,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château le Prieuré 2011 Délice du Prieuré  (Saint-Émilion),"A concentrated, ripe wine, full of toasty new wood flavors as well as dark berry tannins and acidity. It is dense, full in the mouth and packed with ripe fruit. Drink from 2016."
US,87,16,White Blend,white,Andrew Murray 2011 This is Eleven Unplugged White (Santa Ynez Valley),"A blend of Chenin Blanc and Sauvignon Blanc, this wine exemplifies the finesse of a fine Santa Ynez white wine. It's ripe with orange and peach jam flavors, but there's no oak, so what you get is pure fruit."
US,88,46,Pinot Noir,red,Talisman 2007 Adastra Vineyard Pinot Noir (Los Carneros),"A good, rich wine, brimming with ripe, fruity raspberries and cherries and lots of savory spices. Feels a bit rustic, with a sweet, caramelized finish. Drink soon."
US,94,48,Syrah,red,Hug 2013 Shadow Canyon Vineyard Syrah (York Mountain),"Incredibly dark in the glass and potent on the nose, this bottling from west of Paso Robles shows dried blueberry, black currant, black pepper and asphalt aromas, proving thick but not sweet. The wine coats the palate with lavish tannins and bright acidity before delivering flavors of charred berry and peppercorn."
US,86,25,Pinot Noir,red,Bryx 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Sharply aromatic with peppery herb, bramble and thistle, this has a substantial core of cranberry fruit. Tannins are chewy, and the earthy, herbal characteristics, along with unintegrated oak (both French and American) dominate."
US,92,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Spring Valley Vineyard 2013 Uriah Estate Grown Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This wine is a blend of Merlot (45%), Cabernet Franc (34%), Petit Verdot (8%), Malbec (8%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. Brooding aromas of green herbs, flowers and cherry lead to a ripe full-flavored palate that shows a fine sense of balance."
US,87,60,Pinot Noir,red,MacPhail 2006 Wightman House Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Here's a wine that straddles the border between ripeness and unripeness. Very dry and high in acids, its cherry and root beer flavors have an edge of lightly-sugared green mint tea. Doesn't seem like an ager, but it's a clean, interesting Pinot Noir to have with a good steak."
US,94,54,Pinot Noir,red,Talley 2012 Stone Corral Vineyard Proprietor Grown Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Aromas of a raspberry torte with flaky crust mix with cardamom and marjoram spices on another compelling wine from the region's historic producer. Tart cranberries kick off the palate, followed by wet slate and graphite minerality in the midpalate that barely hide riper fruits. It culminates in a cola-laced finish."
US,82,8,Chardonnay,white,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2010 Chardonnay (California),"Soft, overoaked and clumsy, with sweet vanilla, caramel and buttered toast dominating."
US,86,14,Chardonnay,white,Jamieson Ranch 2011 Whiplash Chardonnay (California),"$14 is a pretty good price for a Chardonnay that shows such ripe, succulent fruit. It's rich in oranges, pineapples, limes and mangoes, brightened with crisp acidity. Entirely unoaked, the finish is dry, pure and clean."
Italy,86,13,White Blend,white,Bigi 2015  Orvieto Classico,"Delicate aromas of spring flower and ripe orchard fruit lead the nose. The simple but well-made palate offers mature apple, white peach, lime and a suggestion of bitter almond."
France,87,20,White Blend,white,Domaine des Terrisses 2006 Blanc Sec Terre Originelle White (Gaillac),"A spicy, perfumed, soft wine. The hint of wood opens the wine and provides vanilla, lychee, ginger and artichoke flavors. The downside is a lack of freshness in a wine that feels quite fat."
France,94,95,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Marc Roy 2011 Cuvée Alexandrine  (Gevrey-Chambertin),"This wine has great power and so much complexity, with layer upon layer of fruit and structure. Black fruits give way to a dry, firm end, promising considerable aging."
US,89,80,Pinot Noir,red,Artesa 2015 Block 91D Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Los Carneros),"Thick and concentrated in black and red fruit, this is a spicy, robust and oaky wine that shows the power of the vintage and site."
US,88,30,Syrah,red,Ambassador Vineyard 2013 Estate Syrah (Red Mountain),"Cigar box, café au lait, and dried tobacco aromas are followed by coffee and cherry flavors, with barrel spices lingering on the finish. The wood gets a bit out front but it still delivers enjoyment."
US,90,48,Pinot Noir,red,Buena Vista 2013 Geza's Selection Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a spicy, earthy and medium-bodied selection, lengthy and concentrated in cardamom and forest pine. The fruit tends dark and brooding, with a brambly character balanced against the crispness of acidity. The spiciness persists through the finish."
US,84,36,Pinot Noir,red,Kendric 2010 Pinot Noir (Marin County),"This Marin County Pinot may have suffered from the cool vintage as the raspberry and cherry flavors that it opens with veer into bitter territory. The texture is fine, heavier than usual, the wine just having a hard time coming around."
US,89,24,Pinot Noir,red,Thistle 2007 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Thistle makes a spicy, herbal, earthy style of Pinot Noir, so don't look for sweet, ripe, jammy flavors. The fruit tastes like the tart, wild berries of the Northwest, and it's backed with tart acidity and chewy tannins. But the concentration, focus and detail of the wine elevate it, and it persists in the mouth far longer than you anticipate."
US,91,50,Pinot Noir,red,Roco 2014 Marsh Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir,"Here is a compelling mix of berry, cherry and citrus fruits that are forward and punchy, with a touch of clay anchoring the finish. It was aged for 18+ months in a mix of new and neutral French oak."
US,92,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Barnard Griffin 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Drinking quite nicely at the moment, this is a generous, dense wine with a full complement of dark fruits, cacao, smoke and hints of black tea. From the opening aromatics on through a seamless weave of fruit and barrel flavors, this is irresistibly delicious."
US,92,65,Chardonnay,white,Morgan 2007 Hat Trick Double L Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Marked by a lean minerality, this Chablis-style wine is not one of those fat, opulent Chards that dazzles with sheer richness. It's more subtle than that, and more acidic. Structure, in fact, is the name of the game here, with its lemon and lime flavors that barely break into green apples. Fine now, if not served too cold, and for the next 2–4 years. Beyond that, wines of this kind go quickly downhill."
US,90,34,Chardonnay,white,Fess Parker 2010 Ashley's Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Fantastically ripe and oaky, a Chardonnay that just swamps the palate with wave after wave of pineapple jam, tangerine tart, apricot pie filling and sweet butterscotch and vanilla flavors. All this richness fortunately is balanced with crisp acidity and a fine tang of minerals."
US,92,55,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Pirouette 2012 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is Cabernet Sauvignon (63%) blended with Merlot (19%), Petit Verdot (12%) and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of black cherry, herbs, cranberries and dry chocolate are reserved while the palate offers hedonistic fruit flavors, with lightly dry tannins that hopefully will smooth out with additional time in the cellar."
US,93,38,Red Blend,red,Pulchella 2014 The Revision Red (Paso Robles),"Baked blackberry, vanilla, dust and chocolate show on the nose of this blend of 69% Petite Sirah, 22% Grenache and 9% Tannat. The palate is ripe with plum, blueberry and black currant and lifted by dried ginger and nutmeg, but the dazzling acidity and tannic firmness is what takes it to the next level."
US,91,32,Red Blend,red,Palmina 2011 Alisos Red (Santa Barbara County),"Crushed bricks, rose petals, red currants and grape syrup are sprinkled with elegant black spices in this blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot by Steve and Chrystal Clifton. The palate is silky, redolent with mulberry and tart plums skins, amped up by sagebrush and thyme. It's perfect for a variety of foods."
US,89,40,Red Blend,red,Golden 2012 Coro Mendocino Red (Mendocino),"Impressively dry, medium bodied, very firmly tannic and showing complex fruit flavors, this Zinfandel-based wine needs time to mellow. It smells like fresh raspberries and blackberries, and tastes concentrated and mouthcoating, while the astringent tannins hold everything back just a bit. It contains 34% Syrah and 21% Petite Sirah, and will be best after 2018."
US,87,38,Pinot Noir,red,FEL 2013 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This full-bodied and effusive wine has a sweet, oaky aroma and similarly rich flavors of black cherry and blackberry jam. It feels smooth and luxurious."
US,90,40,Pinot Noir,red,Drew 2009 Balo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This big, powerfully fruity Pinot Noir screams coastal California all the way through. The raspberry, cherry and spice flavors, brightened with acidity, taste of long, warm days and cool nights. It's a good wine, but too young, and would have benefited had the winery held it back a year or so before release. Better into 2012."
US,84,23,Chardonnay,white,Talbott 2007 Logan Chardonnay (Monterey County),"Lots of smoky oak frames modest flavors of pineapples in this creamy wine. Production was 6,300 cases."
US,88,36,Pinot Noir,red,Vista Hills 2011 Marylhurst Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Light aromas of the barnyard don't impede the impression of pretty strawberry-pastry fruit flavors. The aging in 20% new French oak adds streaks of vanilla, cocoa and mocha to the finish."
US,92,18,Syrah,red,Andrew Murray 2014 Tous les Jours Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Showing incredible depth for such an affordable wine, Andrew Murray does it again with this widely available bottling. The gamy nose shows lamb, rosemary, uncracked peppercorns, light tobacco leaf, soy sauce and a touch of tar. Purple flowers rule the palate, with lavender, violet and blossoming rosemary notes, with thyme and white pepper spicing up boysenberry fruit."
US,91,28,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Kendall-Jackson 2012 Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"This is a well-crafted wine that's dense and delicious in juicy red fruit, black currant, licorice and nutmeg. With much of the fruit sourced from the Alexander Valley, this wine shows a managed level of ripeness and oak aging. Structured and lengthy on the finish, this is a nicely put-together package."
US,90,24,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Paradise Ridge 2014 Grandview Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Perfumed lemon blossom is at the heart of this wine's bouquet, wrapped around a full body of lemony oak and savory herb. Complex, it's built on a core of girth and structure, but never becomes overly heavy on the palate, finishing with plenty of minerality."
US,91,36,Pinot Noir,red,Maysara 2012 Cyrus Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"Aged in 30% new French oak, this cuvée opens with full, round, tart berry and cherry fruit. It's textural and broad, with tart citrus underscoring the well-defined palate. It drinks well now but has the structure to age another six to eight years."
US,93,46,Pinot Noir,red,Bruliam 2014 Sangiacomo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Earthy and just the slightest touch reduced, this is a feral, juicy and intriguing wine from the well-known site, complex and medium to almost light-bodied in texture and approach. Cherry and pomegranate compote meet cardamom baking spices to suggest warmth and comfort in a glass."
US,85,30,Merlot,red,Bell 2000 Merlot (Yountville),"Lean and earthy, marked by tobacco, dill and less than ripe cherry flavors. Tannins are tough and gritty. The wine finishes very dry and rasping, showing little fruit. The winemaker seems to have understood the problem here, and added five percent Syrah."
US,91,27,Pinot Noir,red,Lafond 2013 SRH Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Raspberry, dark slate, gravel and a bit of shiitake mushroom entertain the nose on this bottling by the higher-end sister brand of Santa Barbara Winery. Both richly juicy and brightly acidic on the palate, it offers flavors of boysenberry and sagebrush, making for a very lively wine."
US,91,45,Pinot Noir,red,Riverbench 2012 Cork Jumper Rosé Blanc de Noirs Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Red apples, sourdough bread, cherry blossoms and strawberry zest show on the nose of this ever-so-slightly pink wine. The sipping experience is reminiscent of a fizzy, foamy mouthful of Pop Rocks flavored by sour cherries, altogether fun, tart and delicious."
US,92,35,Red Blend,red,The Smuggler's Son 2014 The Smuggler's Son Red (California),"This is a big, bold and dry wine that will pair well with roast lamb chops or grilled steaks. Spice rack aromas and generous blackberry, boysenberry and black-cherry flavors ride a velvety texture of fine-grained tannins. It has good concentration, layers of flavor and a lip-smacking texture."
US,90,25,Syrah,red,Two Mountain 2012 Copeland Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"You'd swear this 100% varietal wine had some Viognier in it, but the orange-peel aromas and flavors are just a hallmark of Yakima Valley fruit. It also features abundant cranberry, mulberry, rose hip and savory notes. The supple feel with light meat accents is where this wine really shines, showing purity, texture and a lot of elegance. Those looking for big fruit, look elsewhere."
US,89,13,Chardonnay,white,Simple Life 2015 Chardonnay (California),"Bright lemon and crisp apple aromas lead to similar but richer flavors, supported by firm acidity for balance. It makes for a lively but flavorful package that both tastes great and is versatile with food."
France,89,25,Pinot Gris,white,Domaine Gérard Neumeyer 2012 Le Berger Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Ripe and full, it offers great spice, yellow fruits and hints of tropical fruits. It has acidity and is dry, but it's delicious because of its rounded texture and generous body. Drink from 2015."
France,87,25,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Vrignaud 2015  Chablis,This wine reflects the ripeness of the vintage while still retaining crisp minerality. Creamed apples are balanced with a tangy texture and soft acidity. The wine finishes with a crisp aftertaste that gives a great lift. Drink the wine now.
US,90,46,Chardonnay,white,Eric Kent 2013 Sangiacomo Green Acres Hill Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Entirely sourced from this Sangiacomo family-farmed vineyard, which is planted entirely to the Old Wente clone, this wine offers fleshy and tropical juiciness and texture. Aged in French oak, the vast majority of it neutral, the wine lets the fruit and acidity speak for themselves."
Italy,91,35,Red Blend,red,Boscarelli 2011  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,"Underbrush, leather, spice and savory herb aromas lead the nose. The smooth palate offers juicy dark cherry, mint, tobacco and licorice alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2018."
US,88,32,Syrah,red,Hollywood Hill 2008 Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"Elegant, aromatic, and expressive in the nose, this blossoms into a pleasing mix of berries, cherries, bark, spice and sassafras. Good acidity, with a lick of chocolate in the tannins and the finish. Though very light for Syrah, this has good balance and length."
France,89,28,Chardonnay,white,Gilles Morat 2008  Pouilly-Fuissé,"Fine fresh fruits, bright with good acidity and a lively fresh character. There is a strong apple skin and grapefruit texture, finishing fresh and full."
US,92,26,Riesling,white,Paul O'Brien 2013 Bone Dry Riesling (Umpqua Valley),"Bone dry indeed, and searingly tart as well, this is loaded with complex, deeply inscribed flavors of fruit, stone and rind. Citrus is the highlight—a compelling mix of lime, grapefruit and orange peel. The finish is world class. Drink now through 2025."
US,92,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Baldacci 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"Tough in tannins, with an astringent, lockdown quality. That's the iron fist of this wine. The velvet glove is the rich, flamboyant core of blackberries and cassis. Give this young wine at least six years to come around."
US,90,65,Pinot Noir,red,Testarossa 2015 Dos Rubios Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"From one of the four Pinot Noir vineyards that this producer controls as monopoles, this dark-hued bottling shows blackberry, black plum, clove and star anise aromas. Tart cranberry, sour cherry and strawberry fruit marks the palate, rounded with rose petal and sage elements."
US,86,10,Pinot Noir,red,Pietra Santa 2012 Route 152 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"This wine leans toward the brown-orange side of the Pinot Noir scale, with burnt orange, cranberry and whiffs of anise. Cooked fruits dominate the palate, with fruitcake and gingerbread flavors."
US,84,19,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Pindar Vineyards 1997 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (North Fork of Long Island),"Loaded with new oak, which in this case means it's cedary and very mentholly,  Under that is some tobacco and coffee.  Very drying tannins clamp down on the finish."
US,91,37,Syrah,red,L'Ecole No. 41 2012 Estate Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The yum factor on this wine is impossible to ignore, with aromas of jammy blue fruit, dried herbs and cigar box. The concentrated, high-octane flavors are full and textured with a lingering finish."
US,86,18,Merlot,red,Goose Watch 2012 Merlot (Finger Lakes),"Layers of vanilla, spice and toast persist throughout this richly textured wine. Sunny raspberry and cherry flavors are pleasant, but peek through a bit shyly on the palate. It's an oaky wine, but supple and seductive with a fringe of finely grained, persistent tannins."
US,89,30,Chardonnay,white,Falcone 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"John and Helen Falcone use Sierra Madre Vineyard fruit from the Santa Maria Valley for this wine, which offers straight-ahead aromas of sweet apple, oak and pineapple. A chalkiness emerges on the palate, with pear flesh providing fruit and red grapefruit pith providing a nicely bitter counterpoint."
US,90,62,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Sparkman 2012 Kingpin Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"Aromatically brooding, this has notes of dark cherries, blackberries, mineral and herbs with abundant barrel accents. It's full bodied, rich and high octane, at times seeming a bit overwrought but still delivering plenty of enjoyment."
US,84,20,Zinfandel,red,Plungerhead 2010 Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),The mouthfeel has sandpapery tannins and some green peppercorn notes alongside riper flavors of blackberries and sweet currants. It's a rustic Zin to drink with barbecue.
France,88,24,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Bertinerie 2009 Cru Réserve  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"A smooth, wood-aged wine that has a rich texture, layers of toast and nutmeg from the wood and peach fruits. The wood needs time to integrate, but already shows that this is going to be a rich wine."
US,88,27,Chardonnay,white,Carabella 2008 Dijon Clone 76 Chardonnay (Chehalem Mountains),"Solid and full-bodied, almost blocky, this big-boned Chardonnay wraps its banana and light tropical fruit flavors in a generous layer of toasty oak. The acidity keeps it fresh, but it's a drink-soon style."
US,84,24,Pinot Noir,red,Stephen Ross 2010 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"Dry and acidic, this has flavors of green mint and sour cherry candy. Not likely to improve with age, but give it an hour in the decanter to let it soften."
US,90,50,Chardonnay,white,Knights Bridge 2015 Pont De Chevalier Chardonnay (Knights Valley),"Baked pineapple and heady creme brûlée scents follow through to the palate of this wine in rich, concentrated waves of flavor. Textured and lush through the midpalate, it finishes with bright, refreshing acidity."
US,85,16,Pinot Noir,red,Eola Hills 2010 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"With its flavors of raspberry and cherry soda, this a simple Pinot Noir. A slight grassy note comes through on the finish."
US,84,12,Merlot,red,Château Julien 2009 Merlot (Monterey County),"At this price, a decent party wine to serve when no one's fussy. It's dry, medium-bodied and fruity, with a pleasant cut of tannins."
France,86,13,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Gérard Bertrand 2008 Réserve Spéciale Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de Pays d'Oc),"A lovely Sauv Blanc nose with pretty floral notes dancing among aromas and flavors of ripe tropical fruit, peach and tangerine oil. Light weight with good acidity and a clean finish. Fresh and inviting; not terribly complex, but a great example of the varietal."
US,94,105,Pinot Noir,red,Ponzi 2014 Abetina Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Focused and dense, this intense wine captures the essence of ripe raspberries. Aged in 50% new French oak, it's got a strong vein of coffee and mocha. The flavors broaden out and penetrate, finishing with highlights of cedar, cinnamon and dark chocolate. Drink now through the 2020s, but decant if you want the full expression."
US,91,20,Chardonnay,white,Replica 2015 Retrofit Chardonnay (North Coast),"This wine is subtle in aroma but extremely generous in texture. It seems to start out slow and then floods the palate with very ripe but not sweet flavors like kiwi, pear and honeydew melon on a nicely viscous, pillowy texture."
US,91,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Occasio 2012 Heritage Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"A tempting, well-balanced wine from a tiny artisan winery, this is medium bodied but packs in a great array of ripe fruit and dark chocolate flavors. Firm tannins and acidity lift it and keep it lively through the finish. It tastes great now but will improve through 2020."
Italy,85,19,Red Blend,red,Dal Cero Tenuta di Corte Giacobbe 2015  Valpolicella,"Light bodied and ideal for everyday fare, this has flavors of dried cherry, ground black pepper and a hint of clove. It's simple and easygoing, with soft tannins."
US,92,40,Chardonnay,white,Sbragia 2007 Gamble Ranch Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"This massive, explosive Chardonnay is marked by extremely ripe pineapple, pear and peach fruit, accented with lots of sweet, caramelized oak. It's a potent, high alcohol wine whose buttered popcorn flavors are complex by crisp acidity and minerals. A bit obvious, but a fine example of its style."
US,88,27,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Saltbird 2014 Migratus Sauvignon Blanc (North Fork of Long Island),"Six months in French oak lend a rounded feel and delicate spice to pressed apple and lemon flavors in this wine. While less forward and fruity in style than most New York Sauvignon Blanc, its richer body and slightly salty, saline palate are enticing."
US,94,75,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Epoch Estate Wines 2013 Authenticity Red (Paso Robles),"Dark and thick in the glass, this blend of 82% Syrah and 18% Mourvèdre leads with black cherry syrup, smoked beef and dark chocolate aromas, which blossom as the wine opens. Rich and lavish on the palate, it has fine tannins that frame its blueberry, cassis and mocha flavors. It's firmly structured, with a lingering acidity."
US,91,20,Riesling,white,Chehalem 2016 Three Vineyard Riesling (Willamette Valley),"Just slightly off-dry, this excellent bottle mixes its ripe lemon, orange and papaya fruit with breakfast tea-like flavors. Its acidity is ample enough to keep the sweetness at bay, making it a fine, all-purpose wine that should please a wide variety of palates."
US,90,42,Chardonnay,white,Mi Sueño 2013 Chardonnay (Los Carneros),"Bright minerality wraps around a taste of wet stone and unctuous, buttery apple in this silky smooth and well-integrated wine. Lemon rind and brioche each make strong companions to the concentrated richness and ripeness of the finish."
US,90,18,Riesling,white,Cinder 2016 Off-Dry Riesling,"There's no mistaking the variety here, with its attention-getting aromas of flowers, mandarin orange and ripe peach, along with lime-zest accents. It drinks off dry, with a plentiful, rich, flavorful palate. There's loads of enjoyment to be had."
US,88,21,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Virginia Mountain Vineyards 2010 Trinity Red (Virginia),"Aromas of fines herbes, chocolate and licorice follow through onto the medium- to full-bodied palate, which displays balanced acids and finessed tannins."
US,90,38,Red Blend,red,Quivira 2013 Montepulciano-Sangiovese Red (Dry Creek Valley),"A blend of 60% Montepulciano and 40% Sangiovese, this is a grippy, leathery wine, the fruit sourced from two different sites in the appellation. Black leather, baked and dried plum, and cherry combine on the palate with breadth and length, finishing as if dusted in cocoa."
Italy,95,66,Red Blend,red,Podere Sapaio 2004 Sapaio  (Bolgheri Superiore),"Not bad for a first attempt. This is a thick, dark wine of almost impenetrable extraction and mature fruit notes of black cherry and black currant. Its aromas are painted in broad brush strokes and invoke roasted espresso bean, black chocolate and smoked game. It has an outstanding mouthfeel, with voluptuous but solid tannins and enormous length. Drink after 2015."
US,86,18,Red Blend,red,Ash Hollow 2007 Headless Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is 95% Cabernet Sauvignon from the estate vineyards. Quite sour with lip-puckering cherry fruit, it thins out and finishes with hard, slightly chalky tannins."
Italy,89,25,Red Blend,red,Cantine Russo 2010 Rampante Rosso  (Etna),"Aromas of moist underbrush, saddle leather, dried herb, menthol and a whiff of game take shape in the glass. The firm palate offers raw sour cherry, cranberry, cinnamon and a hint of tobacco while close-grained tannins provide the framework and leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink."
Italy,92,48,Red Blend,red,Vignavecchia 2012 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Enticing scents of iris, violet, red berry, spice and a balsamic note mingle in the glass. The firm, juicy palate delivers crushed black cherry, white pepper, cinnamon, coffee and menthol alongside fine-grained tannins that give this an elegant texture. Drink through 2020."
US,90,32,Chardonnay,white,Array 2012 Dijon Clone Chardonnay (Yakima Valley),"Otis Harlan Vineyard in the Rattlesnake Hills provides the fruit for this wine. Distinctive aromas of lees, almond, toast and grass lead to creamy stone-fruit flavors that show persistence on the finish."
US,88,13,Riesling,white,Fulkerson 2010 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Zesty aromas of fresh lemon and tangerine peel add vibrancy to this brisk, dry Riesling. It's elegant and fruity, and it offers loads of crisp green-apple and pear flavors that are accented by dusty minerality. A hint of lime-skin astringency surfaces on the finish."
France,88,30,Riesling,white,Wunsch & Mann 2008 Hengst Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"A wine that is mature already, this Grand Cru has some weight and richness. There is a perfumed character and flavors of white fruits. The wine has intense acidity that gives it a steely, tight character on the finish. Drink now."
US,90,40,Pinot Noir,red,August Briggs 2014 Pinot Noir (Carneros),Cherry cordial meets an earthy core of compost and pine forest in this wine from the windswept appellation. Its spicy cardamom and clove seasonings provide tension to contrast its medium build and velvety texture.
US,86,75,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Mulvane Wine Co. 2013 The Cypher Red (Napa Valley),"This is made from equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with small additions of Malbec. Juicy, it reveals a raisiny quality of ripeness around integrated oak and generous tannin."
US,85,20,Pinot Noir,red,Jigsaw 2008 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This would be easy to mistake for Grenache—it's ruby-colored, cranberry-flavored, with hints of strawberry and licorice. Clean, crisp and noticeably acidic, it would be most enjoyable with a richly sauced breast of duck."
US,86,10,Riesling,white,Pacific Rim 2013 Dry Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Appealing notes include pear, jasmine and orange blossom. It drinks a hair off dry with stone fruit flavors that seem a bit dilute."
US,84,40,Chardonnay,white,Franciscan 2011 Cuvée Sauvage Chardonnay (Carneros),"comes across as over-oaked and lacking balance. Hard to find much going on beyond buttered toast, caramel and pineapple jam."
US,84,16,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Kirkland Signature 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),"Sweet and candied, like a dessert pastry, with sugary flavors of currants, chocolate and anise. The structure is fine. Will appeal to red wine drinkers with a sweet tooth."
US,84,30,Red Blend,red,Renaissance 2004 Mediterranean Red (Sierra Foothills),"Fruity and direct, this Rhône-style blend has flavors of cherries, red currants, chocolate, herbs and spices. It's very soft and fairly sweet. Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah."
US,91,65,Pinot Noir,red,Owen Roe 2014 Sojourner Vineyard Pommard Clone Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"In 2014 this vineyard designate was further subdivided by clone. The Pommard bottling pushes big fruit front and center—a juicy mix of blood orange, red berries and cherries. There's a certain stiffness to the tannins still, but overall it's finely proportioned and should be enjoyable through the mid-2020s."
Italy,92,57,Red Blend,red,Volpaia 2008 Balifico Red (Toscana),"Balifico stands apart thanks to its dark, rich appearance and generous aromas. The blend is Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, and together these grapes offer notes of cherry and cassis, plus touches of dried rosemary and toasted spice. In contrast to the boldness of the bouquet, the palate is fine, polished and long-lasting."
US,85,14,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Rancho Sisquoc 2011 Flood Family Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara County),"A simple, straightforward Sauvignon Blanc this is ripe with peach, pear, Meyer lemon and lime flavors, but brightened and cleansed by brisk acidity. The price is fair for what you get."
Italy,85,8,Sangiovese,red,Palagetto 2014  Chianti Colli Senesi,"Made entirely from Sangiovese, this opens with delicate red-skinned berry and Mediterranean herb aromas. The simple palate delivers red cherry and underbrush notes, with a mildly tanninic texture. Drink soon."
US,85,24,Chardonnay,white,City Winery Chicago 2013 Elevated Chardonnay Chardonnay (North Coast),"Flavors are restrained in this medium-bodied wine, so there are not a lot of fruits or herbs to shout out. However, it has a straightforward appeal and will make an unobtrusive pairing with many foods because it has a good, crisp mouth feel."
US,90,42,Syrah,red,Doyenne 2011 Signature Syrah (Red Mountain),"The winery's most-available Syrah is co-fermented with a splash of Viognier. The fruit is tight and compact, clean with red and black berry flavors, framed by firm, polished tannins."
France,93,250,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Pavie 2000  Saint-Émilion,"Under the regime of Gérard Perse, Pavie seems to have become more opulent, more extracted, and, dare I say it, more simplistic. The richness of the 2000 vintage lends itself to this technique. While it is a wonderful, immediately appealing wine, with its intense dark fruits, it seem to lack the complexity of other wines of similar status."
US,87,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,O•S Winery 2010 BSH Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This BSH is 86% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc. Ripe to the point of showing some scents of raisin and prune, this is most expressive of baking spice highlights, clove and licorice. It turns a bit volatile and the tannins seem to be quickly drying out. Drink up."
US,86,35,Zinfandel,red,Renwood 2008 Jack Rabbit Flat Zinfandel (Amador County),"An austere, savory Zin from Amador, one of the smaller-production Zinfandels from Renwood and it shows. Firm tannins, dusty black fruit and spice—a good option for Sierra Foothills Zin fans."
France,87,45,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Fonplégade 2007 Fleur de Fonplégade  (Saint-Émilion),"The second wine of Château Fonplégade is fresh and bright with good fruits, berry flavors and some richness. It has good poise; ready to drink in 2–3 years."
US,92,60,Pinot Noir,red,Davies 2014 Ferrington Vineyards Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This seductive wine has a deep ruby color, jazzy cherry and plum aromas and an elegantly balanced mouthfeel. It offers plenty of fruit flavors that are fresh and just a touch tart like they should be, firm tannins and full body. Best after 2018."
US,92,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Steven Kent 2007 Home Ranch Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"A beautiful, complex and upscale Cabernet to drink now, after a good decant. It's bone dry and a little soft, with intricately layered blackberry, black currant and oak flavors. Feels lush and important in the mouth, and the spicy finish lasts for a long time."
US,87,20,Zinfandel,red,Frei Brothers 2015 Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Brawny and brooding, this rich wine shows a density of flavor and personality. Plum, strawberry and leathery black pepper form its core."
US,85,22,Riesling,white,Schmidt 2014 Riesling (Applegate Valley),"This is done in a soft, loose-knit, wide-open style—not the usual crisp and racy Riesling found in the Northwest. Apple and orange fruits are accented with notes of cracker and grain. It feels a bit flat in the finish. Drink up."
US,86,10,Riesling,white,Jekel 2001 Riesling (Monterey),"A lovely wine, teetering on the edge of sweetness. The pretty apple, apricot, and honeysuckle flavors have a crisp, steely edge of acidity, and there's a rich streak of mineral and diesel that adds complexity."
US,86,130,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Better Half 2014 Red (Napa Valley),"A coming together of nearly equal parts Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller additions of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot, this shows a confectionary streak of cherry-vanilla, its fruitiness offset by dry, dense tannins and cedar-tinged oak."
US,90,34,Pinot Noir,red,Anaba 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Brambly earth and ripe raspberry invite one in on the nose before a taste of soft, lush spice on the palate. The earthiness continues through the midpalate and finish, with notes of mushroom and forest floor that linger through the close."
US,93,50,Syrah,red,Sequel 2010 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This has the excellent acidity to support the ripe, super-concentrated fruit. Dense raspberry, cherry compote, baking spices, cola and licorice all come into play, with a streak of dried tobacco adding further interest."
US,92,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hughes Wellman 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"There's a delightful note of herbs and green olives to this Bordeaux-style Cabernet, although it also shows plenty of red cherries and black raspberries. With smooth, refined tannins, it's just superb for drinking now, although it should age well in a cool cellar."
France,89,25,Pinot Gris,white,Domaine Gérard Neumeyer 2013 le Berger Pinot Gris (Alsace),"An intriguing blend of juicy pear and tart but ripe apple perfumes the luminous palate that shines with fruit. The apple tartness, boosted by a little citrus, creates a lovely balance on this easy-drinking, little fruit bomb."
US,86,42,Pinot Noir,red,Kokomo 2012 Peters Vineyard Gopher Hill Block Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"From a former Gravenstein apple orchard, this Pinot is intense in white pepper and cherry pit, and not unlike the skin of an apple. The zesty acidity sizzles on the palate."
US,83,14,Pinot Noir,red,Five Rivers 2008 Pinot Noir (California),"Basic everyday Pinot Noir. It's dry, with simple cola and cherry flavors, and a grating acidity."
Italy,90,18,Red Blend,red,Fattoria Ambra 2013 Podere Lombarda  (Carmignano),"Alluring scents of bright red berry, blue flower, dark spice and a whiff of espresso float out of the glass. The bright, savory palate delivers juicy wild cherry, cassis, clove and star anise set against firm refined tannins. It's balanced, with bright acidity. A cedar note closes the finish."
US,88,38,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Elevation Cellars 2011 Monolith Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),This blend is 75% Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Merlot and a pinch of Malbec. Woodspice aromas and flavors take the lead followed by an assortment of red and black-fruit flavors that seem a bit dried out. The tannins bring some grit.
US,91,60,Chardonnay,white,La Fenêtre 2009 Bien Nacido Vineyard Block Eleven Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"This is a very dry, acidic wine. It's rather austere, not showing much richness now. With a minerally tang, It's more like a French Chablis than an opulent California Chardonnay. Give it credit for elegance and finesse."
US,93,55,Pinot Noir,red,Davis Family 2014 Rosé de Noir Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Made entirely from Pinot Noir grapes, this is a light, ethereal and lovely sparkling wine, faintly pink in hue with high-toned, nuanced layers of red cherry and orange. This is one to enjoy on its own or at the table, picnic blanket or tailgating from the back of a truck, preferably with soft cheeses."
US,90,25,Red Blend,red,Hedges Family Estate 2007 Red Mountain Red Red (Red Mountain),"Formerly the popular Three Vineyards bottling, this has been re-named, but remains the same friendly Merlot-dominated Bordeaux blend, with just a bit of Syrah adding spice. Smooth and silky in the mouth, it mixes red and blue fruits, with a ripe, round midpalate and light chocolate and toasted nuts to finish."
US,89,26,Pinot Noir,red,Malibu Rocky Oaks 2014 Block Four Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Malibu Coast),"This is a solid wine from a new appellation, offering much promise for vintages to come. Baked red cherry, smashed pomegranate, cinnamon and bay leaf play on the nose, while anise, light clove, strawberry, red plum and red apple vie for attention on the palate."
France,98,150,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,M. Chapoutier 1999 Le Méal Ermitage  (Hermitage),"Chapoutier's selections of the best parcels of vines in Hermitage are set to become legendary. Sold under the ancient spelling of the appellation name (Ermitage), they represent the epitome of the power and concentration that lies behind the reputation of the appellation. This cuvée is the best of the collection, with its brooding, opaque character, suggesting rather than revealing power at this stage. Age it until your new-born baby is old enough to drink, and it will be just about ready."
US,91,42,Red Blend,red,Luke Donald 2012 LDC Red (Napa Valley),"Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon are equally represented in this soft, robust blend that also includes smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Juicy blackberry and plum combine with dusty, integrated tannin, as a length of dark cherry and sage weave in and out."
US,89,18,Pinot Grigio,white,Montevina 2006 Terra d'Oro Pinot Grigio (Santa Barbara County),"What makes this wine so good isn't just its fine Pinot Grigio character of crisp acidity and clean, savory citrus fruit flavors, it's also the unusual winemaking method. The PG was stainless-steel fermented, and then it was blended with some barrel-fermented Chard and Sauvignon Blanc. That adds richer, creamier notes that make the wine complex and exotic."
US,87,13,Chardonnay,white,Cartlidge & Browne 2013 Chardonnay (North Coast),"Fruity, buttery aromas are followed by a generously fruit-filled flavor, smooth texture and buttery aftertaste. It's a well-balanced and well-rounded wine of medium body, and has a tasty finish."
US,91,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Feather 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This 100% varietal wine is a blend of fruit from The Benches, Dionysus and Pepper Bridge vineyards. Aromas of cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, blackberry and French-oak spice rise up from the glass. The palate brings rich, velvety dark fruit flavors backed by fine-grained tannins. It needs some time to fully settle in. Best after 2021."
Italy,89,14,Sangiovese,red,Le Bèrne 2015  Rosso di Montepulciano,"This opens with ripe woodland berry, pressed iris and chopped herb aromas. The young, taut palate offers Morello cherry fruit accented by orange zest and clove against a backdrop of fine-grained tannins. A strawberry note wraps up the tight, fresh finish. Drink through 2018."
US,92,54,Pinot Noir,red,Merry Edwards 2007 Flax Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"New oak dominates this young wine, with vanilla-accented buttered toast and smoky aromas. Underneath the wood are strong, complex flavors of raspberries, cherries, licorice, cola and Asian spices. With fine tannins and acidity, it seems to be a natural for the cellar. Hold until after 2011."
Italy,91,49,Chardonnay,white,Rotari 2007 Flavio Chardonnay (Trento),"Fragrant and refined, this offers scents of white spring flowers, citrus peel, yellow orchard fruit and a whiff of bread crust. The creamy palate doles out candied lemon drop, ripe golden apple and toasted almond alongside an elegant perlage."
US,90,17,Pinot Gris,white,Tangent 2009 Paragon Vineyard Pinot Gris (Edna Valley),"There's no oak on this delightfully dry wine, although you'd never know it from the rich streak of vanilla and smoky butter that accompanies the orange, apricot, lime and honey flavors. It's a brilliant success, bright and zesty in acidity, and one of the most satisfying Pinot Gris on the market."
US,85,13,Riesling,white,Arbor Hill 2009 Riesling (Finger Lakes),"There's nothing subtle about the powerful elderflower, jasmine tea and ripe melon aromas that perfume this heady Riesling. It's made in a ripe, off-dry style but finishes surprisingly dry. An interesting wine, but the aromatics may be a bit dizzying."
US,90,30,Pinot Noir,red,Arbor Brook 2013 Heritage Cuvée Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"A mix of clones 115, 177 and Pommard, this tart, tightly wound wine brings cranberry, black cherry and red-licorice flavors together. There's ample acidity, yet it remains in balance, with good focus and length."
US,90,24,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Oak Farm 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"This wine is full bodied, complex and layered, offering a good example of a flavorful, intricate wine that wins fans by finesse, not force. Cedar, mint and tobacco animate the aromas, and lightly tart blackberry and black plum flavors fill the midpalate. With a moderate dose of fine tannins, it has the grip for juicy beef and pork pairings."
France,89,26,Riesling,white,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2014 Turckheim Riesling (Alsace),"The characteristic 2014 acidity makes a lovely lemony splash in the center of this dry, refreshing wine. Lemon freshness rises from the glass, offering lots of verve and a lip-smacking finish."
US,90,24,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Paumanok 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (North Fork of Long Island),"This bright, citrusy Sauvignon Blanc is full of mouthwatering grapefruit and lemon flavors. It's delicately framed, yet cutting and spry with a mineral-tinged backbone that begs for pairing with oysters and other briny seafood."
US,90,45,Chardonnay,white,Landmark 2012 Charles Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"There's a ying-yang of rich crème brûlée, lemon curd and toasted oak amid good acidity and fresh apple and pear fruit, with inviting aromas to boot. Creamy and crisp it'll serve well aside all manner of seafood, like fresh-caught trout."
US,85,22,Chardonnay,white,San Simeon 2012 Chardonnay (Monterey),"Brown sugar and buttered toast flavors dominate this wine, but it's not cloying, because it has lots of acidity. The mango, tangerine and peach flavors testify to exceptional ripeness."
US,92,24,Pinot Noir,red,Willowbrook 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This light-bodied, surprisingly affordable wine surprises in its lightness of color and texture, its character driven by high-strung elements of pomegranate and tangerine. On the more savory side, expect nuances of earthy mint, bay leaf and white pepper."
US,89,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2014 Artemis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This well-made full-bodied wine exudes a juicy core of red currant, cranberry and vanilla as a persistence of tannin provides power and wooded support. Oak and cedar play nicely together and add a wealth of savory concentration."
US,86,16,Pinot Gris,white,Del Rio 2007 Pinot Gris (Rogue Valley),"Estate-grown from the southern Oregon AVA of Rogue Valley, this Pinot Gris is significantly warmer and more volatile than those from farther north. Soft and tasting of tropical/bubble gum fruits, it's a wine that should be served cold and drunk soon."
US,92,35,Chardonnay,white,Ponzi 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Although 2013 may have been a difficult vintage, for some winemakers it resulted in immaculate wines with impeccable precision and focus. In this wine, the medium-bodied fruit runs from apple to pineapple. Twenty months in 10% new French oak has left an indelible impression of buttered nuts and a pleasantly oily mouthfeel."
US,90,150,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hewitt 2012 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"This is a smooth, dark and rich wine, made from the heart of the appellation in an agreeable year. Balanced, it offers blackberry, cassis and a touch of silky texture, finishing with elegance."
US,90,55,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Script 2012 Exordium Weinbau Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Wahluke Slope),"The aromas of black fruit, vanilla and high-toned spice are brooding but display a sense of purity. The flavors are lighter styled, tart and supple, with bitters on the finish. Far from a big brawny bottle, it explores the variety's nuance."
France,90,40,Chardonnay,white,Château de Maligny 2010 Vau de Vey Premier Cru  (Chablis),"This is a tightly textured wine that has plenty of green stone fruit as well as a bitter almond edge. It is taut, and the fruit has not completely surfaced yet. Age for three years."
US,87,39,Syrah,red,Reustle 2012 Prayer Rock Vineyards Winemaker's Reserve Syrah (Umpqua Valley),"Lightly aromatic, it offers notes of pencil shavings, dark fruit, coffee and pepper. It's medium bodied with a lower alcohol feel and abundant coffee flavors backed by gritty tannins."
Italy,89,24,Pinot Grigio,white,Schiopetto 2015 Pinot Grigio (Collio),"This opens with delicate aromas reminiscent of white spring flower and a whiff of orchard fruit. On the palate, fresh acidity underscores creamy Bartlett pear and nectarine zest that lead to a clean, bright finish."
US,88,42,Pinot Noir,red,Asuncion Ridge 2013 Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"Extracted aromas of dried black cherries, vanilla and clove show on the nose of this bottling from west of Paso Robles. The palate packs lots of action, from root beer and cola to dark mulberry, green peppercorn, black pepper and a lingering anise finish."
US,90,50,Pinot Noir,red,Clawson Creek 2009 Angela Pinot Noir,"A round, fruit-powered, appealing mix of delicious citrus, berry and plum flavors. Highlights of orange peel and baking spices are underscored by bracing acidity. Sourced entirely from the Clawson Creek estate vineyard."
France,90,42,Pinot Noir,red,Pierre André 2009 Clos des Guettottes  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),"This walled vineyard has produced a surprisingly tannic, if impressive, wine for a Savigny in this vintage. It has a dark and firm character, the red berry fruits just beginning to break through the firm and dry tannins. It needs 4–5 years' aging."
US,89,55,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Auclair 2013 Red Wine Heart of the Hill Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"Coming from the warm 2013 vintage, this wine is chock-full of dark fruit aromas and flavors, along with generous spice notes. It brings a lot of appeal, though it occasionally seems slightly dried out."
Italy,87,24,Red Blend,red,Poggio Verrano 2010 3 Red (Toscana),"Made with equal parts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Alicante, this has earthy aromas of black-skinned fruit and game. The dense palate delivers prune, toast and tobacco alongside gripping, rather drying tannins."
US,90,25,Merlot,red,Rutherford Hill 2010 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This Merlot is round, soft and mellow, with ripe, luscious flavors of cherry pie, mocha, honey and toasty oak, along with a hint of spice. Considering the large production of 36,000 cases and the price, it's quite an achievement."
US,84,27,Red Blend,red,Experience 2012 Red (Napa Valley),"This Zinfandel-dominant blend also contains Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah in sizable amounts, rounded out by a handful of Merlot. Relatively light bodied, it has a muted nose. The flavors lean towards overripe, more dried fruit than fresh."
US,91,49,Chardonnay,white,Testarossa 2015 Rincon Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley),"There's an expert balance between lightly melted butter, pithy Meyer lemon and toasted marcona almond on the nose of this bottling from the region's iconic vineyard. The palate is wound up tightly, offering good grip and lots of textural length while showing flavors of chamomile, saffron, sea salt and more Meyer lemon rinds."
US,91,30,Chardonnay,white,Lynmar 2010 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"The cool vintage has kept this wine tart in acidity; and there may even be a touch of botrytis, to judge from the golden apricot note that rides over the pears, limes and buttery cream. Bone dry and minerally, it's an elegant, Chablis-style wine for drinking now."
France,85,14,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château la Croix Saint-Pierre 2013  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"This Merlot/Cabernet Sauvignon/Malbec blend is balanced with attractive juicy acidity and red berry flavors, leaving a perfumed aftertaste. As a light wine to drink young, this Carreau family wine is attractive."
US,84,30,Red Blend,red,B&E; 2009 Red Rhythm Red (Paso Robles),"Pizza, burgers and other everyday foods that forgive rusticity are what to drink with this ripe, highish alcohol wine. It offers typical warm climate California flavors of black cherry jam and mocha."
France,95,65,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Calon Ségur 2011  Saint-Estèphe,"This wine has so many of the structural elements of a Saint-Estèphe, but also is enveloped by ripe fruitiness. Black in color and dense in character, it has sweetness from the plum juice fruits and great acidity. But it is also firm, powerfully projecting a serious potential. Drink from 2022."
US,92,72,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Terlato 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"Another voluptuous Cabernet from Terlato, this is rich and savory with black currant and mocha flavors. Smoky oak and soft but penetrating tannins add complexity. A beautiful, festive wine to drink now or over the next 4–5 years."
Italy,87,16,White Blend,white,Principi di Spadafora 2006 Don Pietro White (Sicilia),"Three native grapes – Inzolia, Catarratto and Grillo – create the blend and show the potential of warm climate, Sicilian whites. This is a surprisingly fresh and crisp wine – reminiscent of cooler climates – with pungent aromas of kiwi, honeydew melon and cut grass."
US,85,28,Zinfandel,red,Spangler 2014 Zinfandel (Oregon),"Sharp, hard and stiff, this high-alcohol wine offers plenty of power, but little in the way of charm .A tight streak of burnt rubber runs through the core of black fruit."
France,87,17,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château de la Vieille Tour 2013  Bordeaux Blanc,"The wine is soft, rounded, showing light acidity and fresh fruit. Melons and pears dominate the ripe flavors, with a touch of almonds and rich aftertaste."
US,93,50,Red Blend,red,Seven Hills 2007 Pentad Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The aromas begin with a pretty violet character, around plum and smoke. Flavors are tightly wound and balanced, with sharp acids. This slowly opens over many hours of breathing time to unveil smooth, soft fruit, light herbs, pretty floral highlights and great texture."
Italy,87,22,Red Blend,red,Tedeschi 2015 Capitel Nicalò  (Valpolicella Superiore),"Charred earth, toast, underbrush and roasted nut aromas come together on this. The palate shows the heat of the vintage, offering raisin and clove alongside close-grained tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit."
France,85,18,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château de Birot 2015  Bordeaux Blanc,"The Birot estate is in Cadillac, the fortress town on the banks of the Garonne. This classic Sauvignon and Sémillon blend is herbal, green and grassy. It is bright with acidity and lemon fruit and with a lightly tangy texture. Drink now."
US,84,12,Chardonnay,white,Pennywise 2013 Chardonnay (California),"Rather lean in flavors, it shows a bit of herbal, savory aromas and tastes slightly earthy and vegetal like fennel or celery. But those aspects are subtle enough that it still makes a good sturdy white wine that is neither too rich nor too soft."
Italy,84,28,Red Blend,red,Cantine Novelli 2005 Rosso  (Montefalco),"Montefalco Rosso is the less austere cousin of Sagrantino di Montefalco and although this blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino and Cabernet Sauvignon offers all kinds of spice, cherry notes and firm tannins, it is too masked by heavy oak tones. The wine exhibits aromas that recall burnt wood or toast, making those oak tones too sharp and obvious to score higher."
US,91,65,Pinot Noir,red,Donum 2008 Estate Pinot Noir (Carneros),"From the Carneros vineyard, this is a balanced, crisp Pinot Noir, with rich raspberry, cherry, red licorice and cola flavors, finished with sweet, caramelized oak and dusty spices. It's a savory, elegant young wine for drinking now."
US,90,50,Chardonnay,white,VGS Chateau Potelle 2015 Chardonnay (Mount Veeder),"Tropical papaya meets moderate acidity in this lush, creamy and voluptuous version of the variety, complemented by enough minerality to cut through the fleshy ripeness. The oak impact is subtle and plays a supporting role, never distracting from the fruit."
US,92,100,Chardonnay,white,Equinox 1998 Blanc De Blanc Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Golden yellow in color, this 16-year-old sparkler presents uniquely pleasant aromas of corn bread, chamomile and yellow flowers. It's not powerfully effervescent, but manages to strike up a rich bubbly cream on the palate, with flavors of corn tortilla and Meyer lemon making for memorable sipping."
US,88,28,Merlot,red,Tamarack Cellars 2012 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A surprisingly green tinge vies with tobacco, raspberry and woodspice for attention. This wine is full in feel with good concentration of flavors but ultimately the greenness provides distraction."
US,88,26,Chardonnay,white,Tolosa 2010 Estate Tolosa Vineyards Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"How about a pizza with prosciutto, mushrooms and mozzarella cheese with this dry, tart Chardonnay? The keen acidity will cut through the richness, while the suggestion of sweet, toasted oak will play well with the meat's umami smokiness."
US,94,125,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Spring Mountain Vineyard 2007 Elivette Red (Spring Mountain District),"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc shows all the charms of the 2007 vintage. It's an opulent, delicious wine, immediately likeable now for its broad array of blackberry, cherry, raspberry, mocha, cassis and new oak flavors. The tannins are soft, but strong enough to protect this wine for the next six years at the very least."
US,87,18,Riesling,white,Mahoney 2007 Las Brisas Vineyard Riesling (Carneros),"Here's a pretty Riesling. It shows the high acidity you want in the variety, and is dry, with savory flavors of citrus, flowers, minerals, spices and petrol. Should hold for a number of years."
US,89,42,Red Blend,red,Proulx 2013 Merveille Red (Paso Robles),"A nontraditional blend of 35% Zinfandel, 31% Merlot, 17% Grenache and 17% Petite Sirah, this offers cooked strawberry, sea-salt caramel candy, plum pudding and sweet violets on the nose. The palate shows more dry restraint, with black currant fruit and herbs of dill, oregano and marjoram."
Italy,93,80,Red Blend,red,Montevetrano 2013 Red (Colli di Salerno),"Intense aromas of red-skinned berry, fragrant blue flower, Oriental spice and a whiff of graphite take center stage. The taut, chewy palate doles out Marasca cherry, blackberry, anise, mocha and a peppery note alongside bright acidity and polished, fine-grained tannins."
Italy,86,17,Pinot Grigio,white,Lungarotti 2008 Pinot Grigio (Umbria),"Lungarotti's bright Pinot Grigio from Umbria offers sunny aromas of peach, orange peel and honeysuckle. There are mature fruit notes here with sweet overtones that would work with appetizers or light meals."
US,84,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Sylvester 2005 Le Vigne di San Domenico Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Rather overripe, this Cab has the flavors of stewed or baked blackberries and raisins. On the plus side are rich chocolate and anise notes, smooth, firm tannins and a dry, spicy finish."
Italy,88,23,White Blend,white,Fontana Candida 2009 Luna Mater  (Frascati Superiore),"Celebrate the best of Lazio cuisine (think platters of frutti di mare or puntarelle, a spear-like endive salad dressed in anchovies and garlic) with Frascati Superiore Luna Mater. The wine's soft aromas include subtle pulses of vanilla, banana and stone fruit."
US,88,20,Red Blend,red,City Winery Chicago 2014 West Loop Red (North Coast),"This is a dry wine meant for the dinner table. It has blackberry and raspberry aromas, concentrated fruit flavors, firm tannins and a taut finish. It will be best to drink after 2018."
France,83,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Domaine du Claouset 2011 Réserve  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"A hard and tannic wine, with too much dryness for pleasure. It's not likely to soften enough to balance out."
US,88,26,Zinfandel,red,Ottimino Vineyards 2005 Rancho Bello Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Bring on the cheeseburgers! This is an outrageously delicious, easy-drinking Zin that will fall in love with charbroiled beef and melted cheese. It's not a terribly complicated wine, but perfect for immediate enjoyment with comfort foods."
US,88,45,Pinot Noir,red,Lost Canyon 2009 Goff-Whitton Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Exceptionally ripe fruit flavors of blackberry and cherry jam are brightened with crisp acidity in this dry, exotically spicy Pinot Noir. It's fine and silky in the mouth, with a brace of tannins. Drink over the next few years."
US,90,18,Pinot Gris,white,Lange 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Pinot Gris from 2013 is looking very good in the Willamette, with crisp, concise, complex flavors. Here it's a mix of lemon, lime and pineapple, with refreshing minerality."
US,91,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Enkidu 2013 High Mayacamas Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"A dusty, sunbaked note in the aroma of this full-bodied wine meets robust and ripe fruit, wood smoke and very concentrated clove, black cherry and dark-chocolate flavors. The color is dark and deep, tannins are very firm, and the mouthfeel is somewhat astringent. This wine needs time to reach its peak, and will be best after 2022."
US,85,45,White Blend,white,Mellisoni 2016 45 Degrees White (Lake Chelan),"This wine is a blend of Riesling (70%) and Gewürztraminer. It brings aromas of pear, lychee and white flowers that are followed by an off-dry palate. It needs some more acidity to pull it all together."
US,86,25,Chardonnay,white,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Layers of toast, char and dill abound on this oak-driven, full-bodied Chardonnay. There are glimpses of fresh apple and lemon on the palate as well, but they peek through a bit shyly behind a curtain. Further cellaring may help to integrate the oak."
US,87,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Bucklin 2005 Old Hill Ranch Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"There's a ton of Cabernet flavor here. The California sunshine of this warm appellation ripened the grapes to cassis and black cherry perfection. The oak and tannin structure is polished and fine, but acidity is a little low, so it's not an ager. Drink now through 2009 for its sheer lusciousness."
US,90,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Browne Family Vineyards 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Drawing from prestigious vineyard sources that include Seven Hills, Pepper Bridge and Alder Ridge, this generous Cabernet is redolent with notes of cherry, cocoa, herbs and dusty spices. The broad, tart cherry flavors are supported with a firm tannic structure that will keep this wine ageing nicely in the cellar for years to come."
US,85,18,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,The Archivist 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Plum, dill, oregano, pencil lead, tobacco and woody berry aromas show on the nose of this bottling. Light in body and flavor, the palate offers leather, tobacco, dried berry and plum-skin elements."
Italy,87,42,Red Blend,red,Grattamacco 2009  Bolgheri,"This vintage of Grattamacco's basic Bolgheri blend (mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, with Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Sangiovese) appears neutral and less intense compared to years past. It does show elegant mineral shadings and cedary wood behind bright berry fruit."
France,91,60,Chardonnay,white,Agrapart & Fils 2000 Minéral Extra Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"The fact that this wine comes from the chalkiest of soils and is bone dry gives it considerable austerity. It is definitely mineral in taste and texture, with a touch of salt and grapefruit flavors;  very structured and tight. It needs to age."
Italy,88,41,White Blend,white,Josef Weger 2005 Rodon Maso delle Rose White (Vino da Tavola),"An aromatic blend of Traminer and Sauvignon Blanc (with small percentages of Pinots Bianco and Grigio), Rodon is a clean dessert wine with chewy aromas of stone fruit and apricot with a touch of rubbery gum on the close."
US,92,40,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Ehret 2008 Bella's Blend Red (Knights Valley),"Made mainly from Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a big, massively structured wine. It offers an explosion of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate and sweet, caramelized oak. It's really too immature to enjoy now, but has the inherent balance to ride out the next 10 years until it throws sediment and mellows."
France,86,13,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Château Queyssard 2013 Cuvée Dorianne  (Bordeaux Blanc),"For a young Sauvignon Blanc, this is surprisingly rich. A concentrated character supports the yellow fruits and light vanilla flavor. Drink now and until 2018."
US,86,11,Pinot Grigio,white,Hogue 2011 Pinot Grigio (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a lean, tart, high-acid vintage for Washington State white wines. Hogue's reliable Pinot Grigio is herbaceous and clean, fresh and tangy."
US,97,85,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Black Coyote 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),"Tasted blind in a large group of Napa Valley Cabernets, this one stood out for sheer power and authority. It's absolutely delicious, dazzling showing blackberry tart, cherry pie with the sweet, smoky crust, cassis and baking spice flavors, wrapped into wonderfully thick, fine tannins. Pure California fruit, but dry, balanced and nuanced. A classic, but high-alcohol haters will find plenty to complain about. Drink now–2020."
US,86,24,Red Blend,red,Brooklyn West 2012 Rockridge Red (Sierra Foothills),"Moderately sweet, this wine has attractive and ripe plum and strawberry aromas, then a soft, plush texture and light, fruity flavors. Made with Barbera, Grenache and Petite Sirah, it tastes sweet and easy to swallow but has plenty of body and alcohol to go with it."
US,92,52,Pinot Noir,red,Marimar Estate 2010 Don Miguel Vineyard Earthquake Block Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Although the tannins give this wine a hard astringency, they can't mask the richness of the fruit. Once you get used to the tannins, you find a blast of cherry and blackberry jam fruit. This is a wine to put in the cellar until 2018."
US,89,14,Zinfandel,red,Kenwood 2006 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"This is a really good Zinfandel for this price. It's dry and spicy, with tons of wild black, red and blue berries and an edge of rich, unsweetened dark chocolate. Versatile and classy. Drink now."
US,92,59,Chardonnay,white,Sea Smoke 2010 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"An exotic, candied style of Chardonnay, almost in a class by itself, this offers flavors including pineapple, brown sugar, lemon drop, ginger and vanilla cookie, honey, green apple butter and baked pear. Texturally, the wine is dry, crisp in acidity and minerally, with a tang to the finish. There's nothing subtle here, so pair this with rich foods, and don't overchill the wine."
US,93,55,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Andrew Will 2008 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red (Red Mountain),"Winemaker Chris Camarda is antiformulaic; his wines in 2008 feature radically different blends from the 2007s. This is a third each Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Cab Franc. It reflects the vineyard's penchant for tart berry fruit set atop astringent, mineral-driven tannins. It's tight and dense, with vertical power. Flavors roll gracefully into a medium-length finish."
France,88,26,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Fournier Père et Fils 2009 Les Belles Vignes  (Sancerre),"Soft and ripe, the normal herbaceous character rounded out with pear and peach fruits. Sure, there is a tang, a kick to the wine, with acidity. But it is the ripeness that dominates."
France,85,30,Pinot Noir,red,Manuel Olivier 2011 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits),"The light color of 2011 is evident in this bottling. It follows through to a soft, rounded, fruity wine that is lightly textured. Acidity and juicy red fruits offer a wine that is drinkable now."
France,88,15,Chardonnay,white,Confidence 2015 Indiscreet Chardonnay (Vin de France),"This rich, full-bodied wine has ripe green and white fruits along with a touch of minerality. It is a sophisticated wine that adds acidity to its complex array of flavors. The wine is ready to drink."
Italy,87,18,Sangiovese,red,Castelli del Grevepesa 2009 Clemente VII  (Chianti Classico),"Dark and savory, this has spicy aromas of clove, cinnamon, prune and red currant. It shows freshness and medium density overall."
France,92,37,Riesling,white,Boeckel 2010 Wiebelsberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Textured, full wine, ripe in character, full of fragrant apple and quince flavors, tightly layered. It's a concentrated wine, dense in character. The flavors go right down into the heart of the wine. Drink from 2016."
US,87,16,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Sawtooth 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon,"The aromas bring notes of herb, sweet tobacco and ash. The plum flavors are tart and full in feel, with the tannins giving a (quite) chalky squeeze."
US,85,55,Syrah,red,Adelaida 2005 Glenrose Vineyard Reserve Syrah (Paso Robles),"Very soft and direct, this Syrah offers lush flavors of blackberries, currants, dark chocolate, smoky oak and pepper. It seems at its best now."
US,86,19,Chardonnay,white,Justin 2012 Chardonnay (Central Coast),"Although Chardonnay might not traditionally be Justin's strong suit, this is a ripe and creamy wine, with notes of tropical fruit, citrus and oak throughout."
France,86,29,Pinot Noir,red,Pierre Morey 2007  Bourgogne,"Light fruit, dwelling on bitter cherry and fresh raspberry flavors. The wine shows crisp acidity, tight tannins and a cool feel."
US,91,29,Chardonnay,white,Bedarra 2007 Reserve Chardonnay (Dry Creek Valley),"Strikes an interesting balance between richness and austerity. Will fascinate true connoisseurs for its mineral-laden suggestions of dried lemons and kaffir limes, and the way sweet oak elaborates them. Crisp acidity provides the final balance of mouthwatering tartness. A true Chablis-style Chardonnay, at a fair price."
France,87,24,Chardonnay,white,Domaine de la Garenne 2009  Mâcon-Azé,"While ripe, this also has a firm structure, with a mix of rich yellow-fruit flavors and austere minerality. With the acidity just beginning to soften, it will turn into a full and more rounded wine."
France,89,80,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine A. Machard de Gramont 2014 Les Damodes Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),"From vines in the north of the Nuits Saint-Georges, close to Vosne-Romanée, this is a structured wine. It has ripe berry fruits and acidity that are still developing through the firm, dry tannins. The wine is still young and needs to age, so drink from 2019."
US,86,28,Zinfandel,red,Kokomo 2009 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A solid Zinfandel, a little sweet but not too much, with softly drinkable tannins. The flavors are ripe, suggesting raspberries, cherries, mocha, brown sugar, cinnamon and cloves."
France,85,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Troupian 2014  Haut-Médoc,"High-toast aromas are followed on the palate by flavors that are more about wood than fruit. That gives the wine a tough, extracted character that probably will not go away."
France,88,13,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Bélingard 2013 Réserve White (Bergerac Sec),The chalk subsoil of the Bélingard estate gives this wine its textured character. The wood aging smoothes out the crisp acidity of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon and adds a light layer of toast. It is still a young wine and will be better from late 2016 or even 2017.
France,88,14,Riesling,white,Pierre Sparr 2010 Riesling (Alsace),"Tight grapefruit flavors, very perfumed and totally dry and crisp, this is a pure-fruited wine, packed with acidity, flavors of white currants and a final zesty minerality. Screwcap."
US,88,23,Syrah,red,Pech Merle 2016 Ivy Rosé de Syrah (Sonoma County),"From 90% Syrah and 10% Zinfandel, this is a fairly dark-colored wine, aged in stainless steel. It shows moderate acidity and highlights of wild strawberry, watermelon and jam, finishing with a tease of sweetness."
Italy,90,22,Pinot Grigio,white,Elena Walch 2010 Castel Ringberg Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),"Elena Walch produces one of the finest Pinot Grigios available (aged 25% percent in oak and the rest in stainless steel) with citrus, peach and almond paste aromas. The wine stands out both for the quality and the intensity of its beautiful bouquet."
Italy,89,35,Merlot,red,Tenuta San Vito 2004 Colle dei Mandorli Merlot (Toscana),"Here is an organic Merlot with well-integrated spice, fresh fruit nuances and natural rubber (a tiny touch of Band-Aid is present as well). Soft tannins and a velvety mouthfeel give the wine a sophisticated edge, and its dusty tannins give it the structure to stand up to grilled meat."
France,91,107,Pinot Noir,red,Henri de Villamont 2005  Grands-Echezeaux,"A powerful, chunky wine, packed with solid tannins that promise good aging. It has a sense of drama in its spice, dark tannins and spacious fruit. This is going to develop well over 5–10 years."
US,85,11,Zinfandel,red,Grayson 2012 Lot 12 Zinfandel (California),"There's lots to like in this affordable Zin. It's robust and juicy with ripe blackberry, cherry, cocoa, black pepper and sandalwood flavors that finish slightly sweet. Nice with pizza, burgers or beef tacos."
US,89,54,Pinot Noir,red,Saintsbury 2010 Stanly Ranch Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Soft and sweetly fruity at this time, offering ripe, candied raspberry, cherry and red currant flavors. It's a little direct and brown sugary, but shows enough stuffing that it could develop earthy, mushroomy complexities in 5–6 years."
US,90,25,Chardonnay,white,Ruby Hill Winery 2012 Reserve Collection Chardonnay (Livermore Valley),"Soft in texture and almost sweet in flavor, this plush wine coats the mouth with delicious vanilla, butter, lemon and poached pear nuances. While full bodied, it doesn't feel heavy and carries a ripe quality through the long finish."
US,84,23,Red Blend,red,Los Pinos Ranch 2015 Texican Red (Texas High Plains),"Soft, approachable and easily structured, this Sangiovese and Montepulciano blend brings forth cherry bubble-gum flavors in a completely gulpable way."
US,87,32,Chardonnay,white,Romililly 2012 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"The buttered toast and vanilla bean flavors of oak barrels dominate this Chardonnay. Underneath that is a good wine, crisp in acidity and ripe in lime, mango and apricot fruit flavors. It's ready to drink now."
US,89,17,Chardonnay,white,Kendall-Jackson 2014 Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay (California),"A big but mild-mannered wine, this has subtle oak and butter aromas plus ripe pear, butterscotch and white-peach flavors. A nicely thick texture carries all the complexity through the finish."
US,90,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Kandarian 2012 Blue Eye Sauvignon Blanc (Willamette Valley),"This vintage marks a big step forward for this Oregon Sauvignon Blanc. As fresh and racy as a bright young Quincy from the Loire, this sappy Sauvignon has the snap of natural acidity and a tongue-tingling mix of melon, lime and grapefruit on the palate. It's drinking beautifully right now while at its most fresh."
US,86,36,Chardonnay,white,Pendleton 2005 Paraiso Vineyards Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Lots of oak on this fresh, young Chard. It's a bit too heavy on the char, toast, vanilla, and woodsap, and not enough about the peaches, pears and pineapples."
US,91,35,Merlot,red,Walla Walla Vintners 2014 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This wine's raspberry jam, cocoa, fig and barrel spice aromas really pop. Its red fruit flavors are rich and ripe, providing hedonistic appeal."
Italy,88,90,Sangiovese,red,Palazzo 2009 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Oak, toast, espresso, burnt rubber and mature dark berry aromas lead the nose. The firm palate delivers dried black cherry, mocha, baked plum, anisette and tobacco alongside bracing tannins. The fruit is starting to dry up so drink sooner rather than later."
US,85,50,Pinot Noir,red,Chehalem 2014 Ridgecrest Vineyards Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),The tart hard fruit is well hidden behind chalky tongue-scraping acids. The wine quickly hits a finish with tough tannins and a residual note of wet paper.
Italy,87,22,Pinot Grigio,white,Maso Poli 2010 Pinot Grigio (Trentino),"This rich Pinot Grigio sees some contact with oak barrel for a fuller, more generous mouthfeel. Aromas include honey, white almond, lemon zest and stone fruit."
US,92,85,Pinot Noir,red,Iron Horse 2014 Q Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"Light in color, Q is the winery's second vintage of a single-vineyard, single-clone expression of the variety. Concentrated in dark-cherry flavor, it's soft and silky on the palate, with an undercurrent of smoky oak and cedar."
France,92,123,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Faiveley 2011 Les Cazetiers Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),"This finely made wine has weight and firm tannins, along with intense acidity. Faiveley owns 12 acres of this premier cru which produces structured wines with fruit tannins and smoky fruit. At the end, the wood aging gives a burnt edge that needs to soften. Drink from 2017."
France,84,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Vignobles Falgueyret Leglise 2014 Monsieur Moustache  (Bordeaux),"An homage to the classic French mustache (rarely see now), this is an amusing label interpretation of simple, fruity Bordeaux. It has plenty of black-currant fruits and a lightly stalky texture that balances the crisp acidity. Drink now."
US,87,26,Sangiovese,red,Silverado 2006 Sangiovese (Napa Valley),"Simple but elegant, with cherry, red currant, pepper and sage flavors wrapped into firm tannins. Has an elegantly silky mouthfeel, like a good Pinot Noir. Drink now."
US,90,38,Zinfandel,red,Seghesio 2012 Old Vine Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Juicy, plummy and dusty, in well-integrated ways, this is a classically earthy old-vine Zin, with plush blueberry and blackberry on the palate that finishes rich in mocha and cinnamon. Medium in body and acidity, it's approachable and enjoyable now."
US,88,15,Red Blend,red,Cline 2015 Cashmere Exquisite Red (California),"Wood smoke and charcoal aromas lead to flavors like cola, steak sauce and cherries in this dramatic, Rhône-style wine blended from notoriously meaty Mourvèdre plus Grenache and Syrah. A touch of sweetness and light tannins complete the picture of this wine made by a longtime Rhône variety specialist."
Italy,87,19,Red Blend,red,Fattoria di Valiano 2011  Chianti Classico,"Scorched earth, menthol, cooking spice and mature plum aromas take shape in the glass. The forward palate offers dried black cherry, coffee and licorice alongside smooth, polished tannins. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit flavor."
US,83,20,Pinot Noir,red,La Dolce Vita 2005 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is a sturdy, stemmy, sharp and chewy bottle. It has some bitter, tarry flavors, but might be up to the challenge of spicy foods or stewed meats."
US,86,30,Chardonnay,white,Calcareous 2011 Chardonnay (Paso Robles),"This is a tasty Chardonnay, showing lots of pear, orange, mango, vanilla-cream and butterscotch flavors. It tastes on the sweeter side."
US,90,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,AuburnJames 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A big-boned wine with a juicy midpalate, this round, plush expression of the variety offers welcome layers of dark cherry, raspberry and plum nicely accentuated with clove and sage."
US,88,25,Merlot,red,Markham 2013 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A big, soft and expressive wine, this will appeal to a wide range of palates with its fair price and easygoing tannins and integrated oak. Between the juicy blackberry and blueberry, hits of espresso take it to more luxurious places."
France,92,23,White Blend,white,Domaine Rotier 2014 Renaissance White (Gaillac),"A wood-aged wine, this blend of Loin de l'Oeil and Sauvignon Blanc is rich and lightly toasty. There are also fine yellow fruit and honeyed flavors that give the wine a ripe complexity and that leave with crisp acidity. It's is ready to drink now and until 2022."
US,88,15,Chardonnay,white,Popcorn 2014 Chardonnay (California),"Suave and subtle, this medium-bodied wine will be fun to sip through an evening and see how it develops. It emphasizes moderate fruit flavors, subtle oaky spices and a lush texture that keeps the flavors lingering on the finish."
US,91,30,Chardonnay,white,Steele 2015 Durell Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),"From a great vineyard site, this wine does justice to its mountain fruit and coastal acidity, capturing both with ease. Juicy pear, apple, pineapple and a gritty minerality surround big shoulders of body and weight, as aromas of flowers puncture the fruit."
US,88,29,Red Blend,red,Wise Villa 2011 Wisdom of Wise Red (Sierra Foothills),"A blend of 54% Merlot with smaller percentages of Cabernet Sauvignon (28%) and Cabernet Franc (18%), this is a nicely structured red that's soft, accessible and juicy, with notes of cranberry and cassis liqueur coming to the fore."
US,91,85,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Black Cordon 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a big, bold and leathery red, its full-bodied tannic profile accented by blackberry and coffee notes. Grippy in texture, it shows dense fruit ripeness and classic underpinnings of earthy spice."
US,88,22,Chardonnay,white,LaZarre 2014 Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Light and reserved on the nose, this bottling by regional legend Adam LaZarre shows chipped slate, lemon rinds and apple flesh on the nose. The palate picks up a touch of petrol on the edges, but centers on more familiar notes of lemon rind, dried apples, honeysuckle and slight hazelnut."
US,93,36,Syrah,red,Margerum 2012 Colson Canyon Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Ripe black cherries get aromatic lift from sagebrush and thyme on this wine that Doug Margerum makes from the fruit of his friend, Reo Reiswig. There is an immediate zing of acidity, with red and purple fruit flavors that bounce between raspberry and blueberry while also picking up mocha, herbs and leather along the way. A very dynamic wine."
US,94,60,Pinot Noir,red,Merry Edwards 2005 Olivet Lane Méthode a l'Ancienne Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Merry Edwards nailed this one. Lush and smooth as velvet, it shows enormously deep, ripe blackberry, cherry, raspberry, leather, cola, soy-splashed Portobello, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors. But it's also a very young wine, to judge from the freshness of acids and tannins. Drink now, with decanting, and should age well for up to a decade."
France,88,28,Riesling,white,Domaine Gresser 2015 Kritt Riesling (Alsace),"A ripe, peachy nose leads to a sprightly palate with just a touch of fizz. The palate is broader and earthier than the nose suggests but remains dry and fresh."
US,90,36,Chardonnay,white,Thomas George 2012 Estate Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A blend of three estate-farmed vineyards, this is a velvety-smooth expression of the variety. It conveys a touch more richness and concentration than some of the producer's other wines, at least at the beginning of the glass, when almond and hazelnut rule the day. But then it takes on a lightness toward the lengthy finish, ending in a mix of lemon zest and apple."
US,90,56,Pinot Noir,red,Roessler 2006 Ridges Ollie & Hazel's Block Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Tough and gritty in youth, this Pinot is showing edgy tannins, tart acidity and unincorporated oak. It's almost like a barrel sample. But it's stuffed with currant, licorice and mocha flavors, and should develop well in the bottle. Try after 2009."
US,81,40,Syrah,red,Stuart Cellars 2007 Limited Reserve Syrah (Temecula Valley),"A dry, tannicly dessicated wine largely lacking in fruit. Tastes of alcohol and pepper, with just a sprinkle of blackberry juice."
US,92,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Efeste 2010 Feral Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Fermented with wild yeast in neutral French oak barrels, this Evergreen Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc opens with a burst of peppery citrus fruit, almost Grüner-like. That spicy note persists throughout the long, sweetly herbal flavor set, blending lemon and lime, pineapple and grapefruit in a harmonious, lively and palate-cleansing crescendo."
US,92,36,Red Blend,red,Galvan 2013 Viejo Red (Solano County),"There is no denying the appeal of this rich, ripe and lavishly oaked wine based on Zinfandel and Petite Sirah. From the perfumed and spicy aroma, to the luxurious texture and ripe, almost sweet plum and boysenberry flavors, it is warm, tasty and hard to resist."
US,90,45,Zinfandel,red,Zahtila 2008 Oat Hill Estate Zinfandel (Calistoga),"Very ripe and soft, this has blackberry, plum and chocolate flavors that veer toward prune and raisin territory. It's dry, spicy and a little hot, but is a great example of a warm-climate Zin at the highest level."
France,89,23,Chardonnay,white,La Chablisienne 2005 Les Vénérables  (Chablis),"From old vines, at least 50 years old, this shows good concentration, giving a dense, ripe, rounded wine full of green apple fruits, hints of vanilla and streaks of minerality."
US,89,30,Chardonnay,white,Bargetto 2015 Regan Vineyards Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Fairly sweet aromas of marzipan, honeysuckle, candied apricot and honeyed orange slices show on the nose of this bottling from a longtime winegrowing family in the Watsonville area. It's much tighter and brighter on the sip, with flavors of slightly sour green-pear skins and poached apple, and a touch of caramel on the finish."
US,88,38,Pinot Noir,red,Raptor Ridge 2010 Trig Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is quite unusual, loaded with notes of green herb, leaf, fiddlehead fern, pepper and lemon verbena. It's herbal and not at all disagreeable, though fruit-lovers may want to look elsewhere. Just 50 cases of this wine were made."
France,93,75,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Alphonse Mellot 2014 Génération Dix-Neuf  (Sancerre),"There have been 19 (dix-neuf) generations of Mellots making wine in Sancerre; at least one of them in each generation has been named Alphonse. This wine celebrates the history and the great quality of the family's wines today. It is richly endowed with both the beautifully ripe fruit and with a sophisticated acidity and texture. Drink this very fine wine now, although, like the Mellots, it will also age."
Italy,90,62,Sangiovese,red,La Magia 2011  Brunello di Montalcino,"Scorched earth, toasted nut, espresso, cured meat and baked plum aromas lead the nose on this concentrated wine along with a hint of new leather. The big, chewy palate doles out mature black cherry, pomegranate, licorice and tobacco while tightly knit, fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink 2019–2023."
US,92,100,Pinot Noir,red,Lachini 2012 Prima Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This is the winery's reserve, made just once previously, in 2010. Rich, deep and chewy, it brings black cherry fruit to the front and center, streaked with highlights of earth and iron. Big at first, the wine seems to lighten up through the finish, with lemon and orange-peel notes leading into a pleasant wash of chocolate."
US,91,55,Pinot Noir,red,Davis Family 2013 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Wild earth and forest floor surround elements of truffle, black tea and cardamom in this vineyard-designate, a savory and wholly compelling wine. Crisp orange blossom and orange peel buoy the minerality and sensation of crushed rocks and rose petals."
US,90,95,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Frisson Wines 2012 Georges III Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Big, bold and brawny, this wine from a very famous vineyard shows off its savory edge with tufts of clove, leather, gun smoke and tea, providing the requisite dustiness on the palate for which the region is known. Medium bodied and integrated well, it represents the vintage and region in all good ways."
France,84,15,Red Blend,red,Château Coutinel 2011 Red (Fronton),"This balanced, fruity wine has gentle tannins and juicy red fruit flavors. It's fresh with acidity and a floral character that makes it already drinkable."
US,89,21,Syrah,red,Owen Roe 2014 Ex Umbris Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Aromas of sweet plum and raspberry jam lead to light pure fruit flavors. It shows a pleasing sense of elegance, with fruit flavors lingering on the finish."
US,90,40,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Matanzas Creek 2013 Helena Bench Sauvignon Blanc (Knights Valley),"Knights Valley continues to be a fine spot for this variety, as evidenced by this wine, which is extremely vibrant in grassy lemon zest and melon. A pure expression of the grape, it offers enough oomph to remain consistent and textured, ending with a succulent suggestion of apricot."
France,89,29,Chardonnay,white,Rijckaert 2014 L'Epinet  (Viré-Clessé),"Aged in wood for 15 months, this wine shows ripe flavors more from fruit than toast. Apricot and Williams pear flavors are richly integrated with the light spice and the lemon crispness. The wine is ready to drink."
US,88,100,Pinot Noir,red,Hyland 2014 Founders' Selection Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"This opens with pretty cherry fruit flavors, underscored with a touch of mineral and mocha. But there it ends, feeling one dimensional and fading fast in the finish. Three bottles tasted with similar results."
US,91,55,Chardonnay,white,Migration 2015 Running Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This estate vineyard in the heart of the appellation provides this wine with a generosity of spirit and flavor, all within a light-bodied package of elegance and restraint. Pear and applesauce give it a fruity edge of ripe round flavor that's likable and nourished by touches of citrus. The finish is as crisp as a lime chaser."
US,90,38,Pinot Noir,red,Gallegos 2011 Boekenoogen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Aromas of strawberry and rhubarb pie characterize this wine, one of the more fruit-forward Pinot Noirs of the leaner, more nuanced 2011 vintage. Those flavors persist on the palate, with well-rounded red fruit making a soft entry and smooth transition through the sipping experience. It finishes more quickly than some of its cohorts."
France,90,33,Chardonnay,white,Marcel Couturier 2014 Le Bourg  (Pouilly-Loché),"Attractive spice and toast aromas add richness to this wine. They lie over the ripe white-stone-fruit flavors that are freshened by citrus. It is still too young to be fully integrated, so wait until 2017 to drink this wine."
US,86,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Schug 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Coast),"This vintage brings a wine that's off-dry, with a sugary accent to the citrus and tropical fruit flavors. It's balanced with crisp acidity, and a hint of green gooseberry tartness."
US,87,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Barons V 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is aged in 100% new American oak, putting tight berry and cassis flavors behind plenty of dried herb notes and astringent tannins. Fine for drinking with a thick steak, but not so much for sipping on its own."
US,88,20,Chardonnay,white,Bonair 2005 Chateau Puryear Vineyard Chardonnay (Rattlesnake Hills),"Fermented and aged in Burgundian oak, this is intended to evoke a traditional Meursault style. It isn't far from the mark; soft and oaky, it's a bit like biting into a ripe banana squished between two graham crackers. Other tropical fruit flavors are in evidence: mango, pineapple and papaya. It's an easy-drinking style that will have a lot of consumer appeal."
Italy,90,40,Red Blend,red,Pasqua 2012 Famiglia Pasqua  (Amarone della Valpolicella),"This opens with aromas of mature black currant and dark baking spice. The full-bodied palate offers mature black cherry, ripe blackberry, licorice and pipe tobacco alongside a backbone of firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017 through 2022."
US,88,32,Chardonnay,white,Michel-Schlumberger 2012 La Brume Chardonnay (Dry Creek Valley),"Flowery and balanced in crisp, dry flavors of lemon and pear, this wine takes its designation from the French word for fog, a nod to its cool-climate environs. Supple tannins and refined acidity round out the deal."
US,90,48,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Calcareous 2012 Tres Violet Red (Paso Robles),"Heavy and concentrated vanilla-cherry cola and gingerbread spice notes power the dense nose on this blend of 45% Mourvèdre, 37% Grenache and 18% Syrah. The dried cherries and vanilla bean character extends to the palate, where it also shows Vietnamese coffee flavors mixed with creamy mocha."
US,91,21,Pinot Gris,white,Owen Roe 2014 Crawford-Beck Vineyard Pinot Gris (Eola-Amity Hills),"This wine shows finesse, driven by its seamless mix of citrus, melon, peach and pear fruits. Immediately delicious, it actually improves by the second day, showing its perfect acid-to-fruit balance. Give it a light chill—not too much—and it's a perfect autumnal sipper."
US,91,35,Zinfandel,red,Robert Biale 2012 Founding Farmers Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Made from a mix of vineyards across the Napa Valley, this pays tribute to the early days of grape growing in the region and is a wine equally worthy of recognition. Exhibiting dark cherry stone and wild strawberry aromas, the palate is complex, tannic and round, a subtle suggestion of smoke on the finish balanced by bright acidity."
US,83,25,Pinot Noir,red,Educated Guess 2012 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This is a rustic Pinot Noir, soft and candied. It has raspberry, red plum and oak flavors. Finishes with a bit of heat from alcohol."
US,94,66,Pinot Noir,red,Shea 2014 Block 23 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"One of several limited-block selections, this particular cuvée is 100% Pommard clone. The lush fruit core contains a generous mix of flavors—candied orange peel, candied ginger and chocolate cherries. The tannins have a breakfast tea character, and everything is smoothly melded and ready for immediate enjoyment."
US,87,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Francis Ford Coppola 2006 Francis Coppola Diamond Collection Black Label Claret Red (California),"Claret is the old British term for the wines of Bordeaux. This wine, the first such from Francis Ford Coppola's Sonoma County winery, is a good buy. It's a bit rustic, but offers smooth flavors of blackberries, currants and chocolate."
US,86,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Wattle Creek 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Yorkville Highlands),"With layers of nutty, toasty oak flavors lingering in the background, this is a Sauvignon Blanc with lushness to its core of melon, guava and grass notes."
France,85,49,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Château de Tigné 2011 L'Isensé Cabernet Sauvignon (Anjou),There is considerable power in this rich wine. With its dark plum and chocolate flavors it is dense and extracted. The alcohol shows in the pepper edge. It is probably too ripe and bitter for its own good.
Italy,85,17,Red Blend,red,Salcheto 2014  Rosso di Montepulciano,"Made with from organically grown grapes, this blend of 85% Sangiovese, 8% Canaiolo and 7% Merlot has aromas of pressed flower and sour berry. The fresh, simple palate offers sour cherry and raspberry alongside vibrant acidity. Drink soon."
France,87,20,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Roc Meynard 2016  Bordeaux Blanc,"Crisp and with a strongly mineral character, this is a young, textured wine. As it softens and gets the ripeness of the vintage, it will become smooth and rich. Drink from late 2017."
US,89,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Market Vineyards 2010 Derivative Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Slightly high-toned and sharp, this Bordeaux-style blend of 40% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc was aged in a mix of French and American oak. Cherry cola flavors, with a dash of sassafras, are highlighted with hints of toasted walnuts. It's a good value, a bit tannic, but drinking nicely right now."
US,88,30,Merlot,red,Bell 2006 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This is a nice, easy-drinking Merlot, but it also has enough complexity to pair with a good cut of meat. It's dry and shows stylishly fine tannins that frame rich flavors of blackberries, cherries, licorice and cola."
US,87,16,Pinot Noir,red,Layer Cake 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"There's something delicious about this wine, but it's not very Pinot Noir-like. Aromas of barbecue, bacon fat, smoked meats and strawberry carry through to the flavor profile, making it a perfect pairing for grilled ribs."
US,89,40,Pinot Noir,red,Walnut City WineWorks 2012 La Cantera Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"One-third of the wine went through whole-cluster fermentation, giving an edge to a fresh herb and moist earth component. A streak of iron and a touch of licorice surrounds firm cherry fruit. It's a solid effort that fades a bit quickly."
France,90,21,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Magneau 2007 Cuvée Julien  (Graves),"A subtly wood aged wine, the white fruit flavor giving an extra dimension with a touch of honey. It has all the direct, delicious fruit of 2007, the wine then rounded out with nutmeg and soft acidity."
US,91,25,Pinot Noir,red,Laetitia 1999 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Quite ripe and juicy, serving up a rich blend of black-cherry, plum and herb flavors. It fans out on the palate to reveal hints of licorice, smoke and even chocolate. More muscular than your average Pinot, it's plush and smooth on the finish."
US,89,18,Riesling,white,Bloomer Creek 2011 Tanzen Dame Auten Vineyard 1st Harvest Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Layers of spice, lanolin and orange rind stand out curiously on this intriguing Riesling fermented spontaneously with indigenous yeast, and subject to 5 months on its lees. It's strikingly brisk with tart, lemony acidity, but rich with a rustic, savory apple flavor. It's a funky, thoroughly unique wine, but also a remarkably complex wine to savor through the course of a long evening."
US,89,45,Syrah,red,Dunham 2006 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Very pretty and soft upon entry, with tangy boysenberry fruit, this young Syrah is sharply defined and buoyed by sharp acids. Lightly floral and still a bit yeasty, it offers scents of brioche, orange blossom and sweet grape candy. An elegant, feminine Syrah."
France,89,17,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Louis Bernard 2015 Domaine le Garrigon Cuvée des Vieux Truffiers Red (Côtes du Rhône),"Plush and velvety in texture, this is a reasonably mouthcoating and rich wine made from organic grapes. Blackberries, plums and dark chocolate mingle easily on the palate, lingering on the finish. Drink now–2020."
US,93,48,Pinot Noir,red,Suacci Carciere Wines 2006 Suacci Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a new brand and a very good introductory Pinot Noir. In its light, silky mouthfeel and deep, complex flavors, it showcases its Russian River origins in a classic way. Offers up brilliantly ripe flavors of red currants, licorice, cola, gingerbread, mocha and spices, wrapped into a dry, balanced structure. Best now for its youthful charm."
US,88,30,Riesling,white,Hyatt 2008 Winter Harvest Riesling (Rattlesnake Hills),"Succulent, dense and syrupy, this dessert Riesling brings a lush midpalate of honey, blossom, tea, candied citrus, butterscotch and more. It's loaded with flavor, just a little high-toned, and falls on the soft side for Washington dessert wines. But delicious? You bet!"
US,93,108,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Alpha Omega 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"With an underlying current of power and tension, this wine offers a wealth of chocolate, dust and tobacco leaf flavors, its texture softly layered with integrated tannin and oak. Complex and long on the finish, it continues to unravel in the glass."
US,82,15,White Blend,white,Jamesport NV Cinq White (North Fork of Long Island),"This unusual blend of white grape varieties (everything from Sauvignon Blanc to Gewürztraminer) is a bit savory on the nose and palate with flavors of pressed apple and caramel. It's bold in alcohol, but a bit demure in flavor concentration and finishes with a hint of green, reedy notes."
Italy,87,22,Red Blend,red,Castello di Meleto 2012 Meleto  (Chianti Classico),"Dried cherry, dark berry, tobacco and grilled herb sensations all come together in this fresh, straightforward red. Smooth but rather fleeting tannins support the bright, juicy flavors. Drink through 2016."
France,92,40,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine Gérard Fiou 2014 Le Grand Roc  (Sancerre),"Produced from 60-year-old vines, with some new wood aging, this complex, ripe wine has an intense structure, with layers of vanilla and spice. The crisp nature of Sauvignon Blanc adds brightness to the ripe roundness. Drink now."
US,87,35,Chardonnay,white,Dois Irmãos 2015 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Owing perhaps to its youth,this remains an uneasy mix of acid, oak, apple and citrus. It has strong components that are not entirely integrated. Another year or two in bottle would be a good idea."
France,86,30,Chardonnay,white,Tramier et Fils 2014  Saint-Véran,"Still young, this crisp wine is at the beginning of its development. Time will bring out the ripe apple fruit and the touches of spice that are just hints now. Drink from 2017."
US,88,50,Pinot Noir,red,Landmark 2012 Rodgers Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"There's a fresh, juicy sense of dark cherry and cranberry in this medium-bodied wine. A lurking forested, mushroomy earthiness hovers around it as well, the finish awash in rich, dark toasty oak accented by notes of chocolate."
US,93,55,Pinot Noir,red,Aubichon Cellars 2012 Vista Hills Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Good grip and detail highlight this vineyard designate. Smoke, pipe tobacco, a whiff of cigar and a spicy edge bringing in cinnamon and clove are all well-matched to the ripe, plush fruit. Length and complexity make this a standout."
Italy,87,16,Pinot Grigio,white,Peter Zemmer 2014 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),"Aromas of wisteria and green apple lead the way on this straightforward white. The tangy palate tastes of juicy pear, citrus and a hint of white almond while zesty acidity and a mineral note give the finish a slight lift."
Italy,89,30,Red Blend,red,Mangiacane 2011 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"A blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and 5% Colorino, this offers delicate ripe black-skinned fruit and cooking spice aromas. On the palate, ripe black cherry, espresso and clove flavors are framed by firm tannins. Drink through 2019."
US,89,42,Chardonnay,white,Stephen Ross 2015 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Extremely light and delicate aromas of lemon, Gala apple and pear flesh show on the cleanly delivered nose of this bottling by Steve Dooley. There is also a lot of restraint on the palate, perhaps even a tad too much, with fluttering hints of chalk, sour limes and riper pear. The texture is compelling."
US,92,42,Pinot Noir,red,Lombardi 2014 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This small producer continues to impress with this floral, impressively made effort, sourced from several vineyards, including Terra de Promissio. Sly layers of raspberry define juicy acidity and sizable tannin and oak that support but don't intrude. The finish continues the theme of vibrancy, lingering in cherry and dried cranberry."
US,90,25,Syrah,red,Kendall-Jackson 2007 Grand Reserve Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Here's a good buy in a big, rich, decadently delicious Syrah. Soft and dry, with refined tannins, it offers flavors of currants, blackberries, cherries, chocolate, licorice, Dr. Pepper cola, black pepper and spices. Easy to like, yet complex."
US,90,38,Syrah,red,Dante Robere 2014 Estate Syrah (Livermore Valley),"Concentrated, jammy fruit flavors meet full body and sturdy tannins in this well-made wine. It has a large presence due to alcoholic strength and the ripe spectrum of its fruit flavors, which includes raisin, black cherry and dried fig. Yet, tannins and acidity provide a firm texture that keeps it feeling balanced."
US,84,30,Merlot,red,Merriam 2003 Windacre Merlot (Russian River Valley),"This bottling from Merriam has been all over the board over the years. It seems to do better in a warmer vintage. The 2003 vintage was not a great one in the North Coast, and this wine, while showing some polished flavors, is a bit lean. The cherry and currant flavors have been enriched by 50% new oak. Drink now."
US,87,34,Zinfandel,red,Mazzocco 2014 Beasley Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Ripe and plummy in explosive fruit and heat, this wine shows cherry-berry jamminess wrapped in a leathery, meaty package dusted in cinnamon and brown sugar."
US,94,32,Chardonnay,white,Donkey & Goat 2016 Linda Vista Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"This vineyard is in the West Oak Knoll area of the valley. The wine was left unfined and unfiltered by the winemakers, who employ native yeast for fermentation. Juicy stone fruit and zippy acidity strike a chord of balance and complexity that's low in oak and deliciously crisp in peach."
US,86,24,Chardonnay,white,Jigar 2010 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"After a poor showing in 2009, Jigar has redeemed itself. Their 2010 Chardonnay is rich and smooth in tropical fruits, cream, buttered toast and cinnamon spices. It's starting to show its age, so drink up."
France,85,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine de l'Herré 2015 La Galope Sauvignon Blanc (Côtes de Gascogne),"This is a soft wine whose herbal character is held in check by a smooth texture. It is bright and crisp, with plenty of citrus and gooseberry flavors as well as intense acidity. The wine is ready to drink."
Italy,91,72,Red Blend,red,Tenuta di Biserno 2012 Il Pino Red (Toscana),"You'll find aromas of mature dark-skinned fruit, cooking spice, tobacco, licorice and a whiff of mocha on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. The delineated palate offers ripe and dried black currants, ground pepper and dark chocolate alongside silky tannins that give it a polished texture. Drink through 2018."
US,88,28,Pinot Noir,red,Longboard 2006 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"One-third new French oak adds a roasted, smoky vanilla overlay to the rich fruit. The underlying wine brims with ornate flavors of cherries, raspberries and blackberries that have been baked into a pie. A sleek finish of anise and cola adds interest. Drink now through 2009."
US,87,56,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Thomas Fogarty 2005 Gist Ranch Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Tannins mark this tough, still young wine from beginning to end. The astringency envelops the fruit, giving the mouthfeel a hard, dry astringency. Even though there are some well-developed blackberry and currant flavors, the wine is unrelieved in harshness. Try cellaring until at least 2013, but it's risky."
US,83,24,Sangiovese,red,Morovino 2005 Sangiovese (Santa Barbara County),"The fruit is fading on this pale, silky wine, and the alcohol is showing through, giving heat to the red cherry, orange and cola flavors. Not going anywhere, so drink up."
US,92,55,Syrah,red,Betz Family 2012 La Côte Rousse Syrah (Red Mountain),"This aromatically appealing wine brings aromas of blue fruit, barbecue briquettes, herbs, mineral and assorted spices. The fruit flavors are lithe yet intense, with a squeeze of tannins that lead to a supremely long finish."
US,90,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Steven Kent 2008 Ghielmetti Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"This lovingly made wine is packed with boysenberry, black cherry and swirls of vanilla cream around its soft, round texture and structure. Its long finish is laced with plum, whispers of smoke, licorice and a touch of cedar. Another 3–5 years in bottle will tame its tannins further and enhance every last nuance."
US,86,15,Zinfandel,red,Ryzin 2014 Zinfandel (Central Coast),"Rich red cherry, anise and a bit of smoke show on the nose of this affordably priced bottling from Kevin Riley. The palate is quite grippy, with flavors of dried blueberry, dark chocolate and black coffee."
France,98,138,Pinot Noir,red,Louis Jadot 2005  Clos de la Roche,"This is a powerhouse of a wine. It is driven forward by immense tannins as well as by superrich fruit that still keeps itself in check by a velvet texture. There is spice, acidity, some toast and vanilla, and finally a sunburst of warmth."
US,89,36,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Stottle 2013 Big Eddie Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This combines 60% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Malbec. Its baking spice, black fruit and herb aromas are followed by silky-smooth dark fruit flavors that linger on the finish."
Italy,86,45,White Blend,white,Diadema 2012 D'Amare White (Toscana),"Made from Chardonnay and Viognier, this wine opens with peach and apricot aromas that carry over to the palate alongside notes of lemon peel and honey. While it opens strong, it finishes abruptly."
US,92,125,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Kadiem 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is an awesome Cabernet. It's 100% varietal, with lots of French oak. It shows blackberry jam, black currant, chocolate and sweet oak flavors that are absolutely delicious. The wine is said to come from the esteemed Morisoli Vineyard, in Rutherford."
US,87,72,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Duckhorn 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Made in large quantities from estate vineyards as well as one sourced site in Rutherford, this wine shows a richness of red fruit and a kick of heat around prominent notes of oak."
US,87,42,Syrah,red,Walter Dacon 2008 C'est Syrah Magnifique Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Finished in French oak, the Magnifique bottling from Walter Dacon seems a bit plain, almost generic in this vintage. Red fruit, noticeably high alcohol (14.8%) that you can taste, and tongue-scraping astringency suggest that this may need significantly more bottle age to pull itself together."
US,94,60,Chardonnay,white,Talbott 2004 Cuvée Carlotta Chardonnay (Monterey County),"This is a barrel selection from the winery's Sleepy Hollow Vineyard and is one of the most concentrated Chardonnays in California. Has the honeyed richness of a botrytized wine, but is absolutely dry. Tastes like an apricot and pineapple tart, with seasonings of nutmeg, cinnamon, and the smoky, nutty pie crust. Very few California Chardonnays need time, but this one does. Stash until late 2008, but this powerhouse should gradually peak over a decade."
France,88,15,Merlot,red,Groupe Clinet 2015 Ronan by Clinet 100%  (Bordeaux),"The wine is ripe, rounded and with fine rich fruit. Its structure is balanced with the blackberry fruits, giving density as well as fine acidity. Drink this well-made wine from 2018."
US,92,32,Pinot Noir,red,Elizabeth Chambers 2011 Winemaker's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"An elegant debut for this new Oregon winery, the Winemaker's Cuvée opens with lovely floral and herbal scents, moving into a detailed, precise and well-configured palate, with pretty raspberry and cherry candy fruit. It's set in a sturdy frame of acid and tannin, and seems to gain concentration through the long finish."
US,91,20,Chardonnay,white,Bogle 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Clarksburg),"This is a full-bodied and extroverted wine. It smells like melted butter and baking spices and tastes like nougat and caramel with just a touch of sweetness. Oaky in a moderate way, it offers great citrus and pineapple on the midpalate and a lingering finish."
US,88,27,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Telaya 2013 Sruth Boushey Vineyard Red (Yakima Valley),"Merlot and Cabernet Franc make up the majority of this blend. The aromas of dried herbs, pencil lead, cherry and spice are subdued while the palate brings a somewhat elegant style, with the tannins seeming a bit bunched up."
US,88,25,Pinot Noir,red,Amity 2015 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The ripe black-cherry fruit brings immediate appeal, in an unapologetically fruity, forward style. The acids are in perfect harmony, and the overall balance is just right, with a juicy, tangy snap to the finish."
US,87,24,Merlot,red,Waterbrook 2012 Reserve Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"There's much to enjoy with this wine's aromas of vanilla, coffee, baking spices, raspberry and green wood. The sweet flavors show cranberry-like tartness and grainy tannins."
Italy,91,60,Sangiovese,red,Carpineto 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,"Fruity plum aromas mingle with dark spice, chopped herb and violet notes on the nose of this full-bodied red. On the palate, fleshy black cherry, clove and anise flavors are set against chewy tannins and fresh acidity. It's already approachable but will also offer years of enjoyment. Drink 2018–2023."
US,85,14,Pinot Noir,red,Cambridge & Sunset 2014 California Series Pinot Noir (California),"This good, sturdy wine has ripe, broad fruit flavors, medium to full body, and a relaxed mouthfeel."
US,92,50,Chardonnay,white,Walt 2012 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This is an elegant, heady Chardonnay beaming in floral jasmine aromas, honey and oak. Bright on the palate, it offers lively acidity and an abundance of pineapple and mango, tropical in all the right ways."
US,90,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Decoy 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Made for broad release, this wine impresses for its rounded, approachable layers of dried herb and anise, the tannin and oak lightly applied. Blended with 10% Merlot, it finds a jolt of richness on the finish, a showcase for notions of chocolate, cherry and blackberry."
US,88,85,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards 2013 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"Woody tannins support this full-bodied reserve wine's dark, brooding black fruit. Grippy on the palate, it combines forceful mocha, leather and cedar flavors with touches of sage and graphite."
Italy,88,20,Pinot Grigio,white,Colutta 2013 Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"Delicate fragrances recall white wild flowers and white tree fruit. The bright, medium-bodied palate delivers tart green apple, mature pear and a hint of lemon zest alongside crisp acidity."
US,85,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Alma Sol 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),"This unoaked Sauvignon Blanc showcases pure flavors of lemon, lime and green melon. The acidity is brisk, providing brightness. A touch of sugary sweetness on the finish should make it pair nicely with Asian fare."
France,88,28,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine Tinel-Blondelet 2015 Domaine de la Croix Canat Les Blancs Gâteaux  (Sancerre),"This is a lively tangy wine that is made to drink young. With its crisp texture, hint of minerality and lively acidity, it is a refreshing wine that could serve both as an apéritif and as an accompaniment to seafood."
US,87,39,Zinfandel,red,Mauritson 2008 Cemetery Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile),"Very high in alcohol, to the tune of nearly 16%, making this Zin hot and also rather sweet, an impression that may be reinforced with residual sugar. It's made in that big, Porty style, with dried fruit and chocolate flavors."
US,83,14,Chardonnay,white,Vinum Cellars 2011 Chardonnay (North Coast),"A tropical Chardonnay with a full-bodied personality and aromas of vanilla and caramel. Priced fairly, it'll please California Chardonnay fans who like a bigger style."
US,89,35,Syrah,red,Scarborough 2010 The Immortal Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Brambly berries and blue plums anchor the flavors of this lovely Syrah, sourced from the Lewis Vineyard. The balance of natural acids and lightly astringent tannins keeps the fruit razor sharp, and the highlights of red licorice add dimension. Drink now or over the next five years."
US,88,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Rock Wall 2014 Rigg Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (San Francisco Bay),"From Shauna Rosenblum, the daughter of Rosenblum Winery's founder, comes this pyrazine-forward bottling, which may wow sommeliers but could confuse the public. The nose is both grape-y and peppery with garden herbs, and then the palate is tart and tangy, which is odd for a Cab. Yet the high-acid approach makes for a bright, stylish and savory wine, worth seeking out a sip."
US,92,65,Red Blend,red,Renwood 2013 Grandmere Red (Amador County),"Lots of richness and a multi-layered personality make this deep-colored, full-bodied wine delicious and interesting too. It's a big red, with bold berry and black cherry flavors, an especially attractive texture that's velvety and firm at the same time, and a long, lingering finish."
US,94,450,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Verité 2008 La Joie Red (Sonoma County),"Right now this is not typically soft and lush like a cult Cab, but hard in tannins, with minerality like little particles of granite. Buried deep down is a pirate's treasure of ripe, intense blackberry fruit. New oak, to the tune of 94%, doesn't cloud the wine, suggesting this blend's its intensity and concentration. The wine is comprised of all five classic Bordeaux varieties, sourced throughout Sonoma County. Clearly this is one for the cellar; drink after 2018."
US,91,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Stags' Leap Winery 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville),"Muted aromatically at first, pushing to impart rose, sage and violet, this red offers an edginess of tobacco leaf and peppery meat. Structured acidity provides appreciated support and a contrast to medium-sized tannin."
US,83,14,Pinot Gris,white,Silvan Ridge 2001 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"Fairly light and innocuous; you really have to make an effort to draw anything from the nose. The palate is sweet and sugary, especially for Pinot Gris, which should be more dry and snappy. And that sweetness carries onto the finish and all the way out the back door. Not offensive, but overly sweet and thick given the grape and origin."
France,89,68,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Heresztyn 2010  Chambolle-Musigny,"Vinified in the soft, opulent style of Chambolle, this is ripe and round. With its dry edge and rich fruit, the structure of the apparent is apparent. The acidity cuts through to give a juicy element. Already delicious to drink, but it's worth aging over 2–3 years."
US,82,17,Red Blend,red,Hess Select 2010 Treo Winemaker's Blend Red (California),"This is harsh and scoury in the mouth, with thin blackberry and caramel flavors and some vegetal notes."
US,91,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Wallis Family Estate 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"Tough and hard, this is a Cabernet that tastes old fashioned with its dry, tannic astringency. It certainly marches to a different beat, even for the Diamond Mountain District that's known for difficult tannins. Will it age? There's a solid core of black currant and green olive flavor that suggests it will. Hold until 2018, at least."
Italy,89,50,Sangiovese,red,La Colombina 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,"This opens with earthy forest floor, leather and oak-derived vanilla notes. The brawny, monolithic palate doles out ripe Morello cherry, raspberry jam and licorice flavors, with a warming layer of alcohol. Solid tannins keep it feeling firm. Drink 2019–2025."
US,91,34,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Maxville 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This is a high-toned white driven by citrus and pear flavors, with a punch of oaky power and full-bodied richness on the finish."
US,90,25,Sangiovese,red,Luna 2008 Sangiovese (Napa Valley),"Dry and tough in tannins, yet impressive for balance and integrity. Shows currant, blackberry and smoky flavors, with a firm minerality. One of the better, more elegant Sangioveses out there."
Italy,89,45,Red Blend,red,Pasqua 2012 Black Label  (Amarone della Valpolicella),"Aromas of toast, roasted coffee bean, stewed plum and a whiff of underbrush lead the nose. The solid palate offers dried black cherry, raspberry jam, nutmeg and black pepper alongside tightly woven tannins. Drink 2017–2022."
US,95,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Terra Valentine 2007 Wurtele Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"A well-made wine, showing lots of terroir in the mineral-infused blackberry, black currant, chocolate and anise flavors. The tannins are structurally superb, while the finish is dry and complex. A very fine wine that should gather momentum for at least a decade."
France,92,72,Chardonnay,white,Pierre Gimonnet et Fils 2005 Oenophile Premier Cru Blanc de Blancs Extra Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"The extra age on this bone-dry wine has paid off, as the taut character of a young wine has been tempered with toast, creating a round feeling. It is perfectly in harmony now, beautiful and crisp."
France,93,107,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Domaine Clarence Dillon 2013 La Clarté de Haut-Brion  (Pessac-Léognan),"Fresh citrus and tangy orange give this perfumed wine both fruitiness and a tight, mineral texture. It has enough structure to age; drink from 2018. This bottling is a blend of second-level white grapes from two Domaine Dillon properties: Château Haut-Brion and Château La Mission Haut-Brion, both in Pessac-Léognan."
US,84,10,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Castle Rock 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"A little green, with a minty sharpness to the modest cherry-berry flavors. But it's dry and sound, and a pretty good everyday sipper at this price."
US,89,23,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Bodkin NV Cuvée Agincourt Blanc de Blanc Brut Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),"Floral and spicy aromas like lychee and rose petal give an exotic twist to this unusual light-bodied wine made from Sauvignon Blanc. It tastes quite dry, with a fine-beaded texture as well as ample acidity to buoy the wine's fruity and floral characteristics."
US,86,23,Chardonnay,white,Dillon 2009 Stainless Steel Fermented Chardonnay (Yountville),"This brims with ripe, forward flavors of pineapples, golden mangos, honey and spicy pears, with vanilla and buttered toast notes despite being unoaked."
France,88,30,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Lamothe de Haux 2009 Château Manos Réserve du Château  (Cadillac),"Cadillac faces Barsac and Sauternes across the Garonne river and shares the same autumn conditions that give the noble rot in the sweet wines. This wine offsets sweetness with a fresh, lemon marmalade crispness to give a well-balanced, ready-to-drink wine."
US,86,40,Syrah,red,Griffin Creek 2011 Syrah (Rogue Valley),"Syrah can be expressive even when slightly green, as it is here. Strawberry and raspberry fruit flavors are set amidst sharp, slightly chalky, citrusy acids. Best to drink this with grilled meats."
US,85,33,Pinot Noir,red,Paul Dolan 2010 Filigreen Pinot Noir (Mendocino County),"This is a huge Pinot Noir—big-boned all around—tasting of warm climate fruit, with bulky tannins and a heavy oak presence. Let it open a bit to let out the dark plum and earthy spice flavors."
US,91,32,Zinfandel,red,Kokomo 2012 Pauline's Vineyard Winemaker's Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Smoky aromas give this wine allure, its layers of flavor soft and flowery, accented by red berry fruit. On the elegant spectrum of the variety, the wine is fairly subtle, with an evolving cinnamon spiciness to the finish."
US,86,12,White Blend,white,Pedroncelli 2015 Friends White (Sonoma County),"A blend of 58% Sauvignon Blanc and 42% Gewürztraminer, this wine was given no oak aging and has a slight percentage of residual sugar. Peach colored, it's also flavorful in peach and apricot, simple and easy to like, with a slight spritz to the end."
US,89,42,Syrah,red,Gainey 2005 Limited Selection Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),"A very nice, polished Syrah that shows its cool-climate origins in the brisk acidity and black pepper spiciness that make the tastebuds whistle. There's a good core of blackberry, coffee and baker's chocolate fruit, although it could be a little more concentrated for the price. Drink now through 2009."
US,92,65,Pinot Noir,red,Ken Wright 2012 Savoya Vineyard Pinot Noir,Pomegranate and raspberry fruit are highlighted with sharp scents of orange flesh and peel. The buoyant acidity and overall tightness suggest that this will continue to evolve and improve over the next several years. It's lightly spiced with a well-managed touch of new oak.
France,93,99,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Vincent Girardin 2010 Les Pucelles Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),"Wood and ripe fruit flavors drive this explosively fruity wine. Its richness is balanced by the acidity from green apple and lime fruits. Spice from the wood aging adds piquancy, leads to a final burst of textured minerality."
US,86,9,Riesling,white,Washington Hills 2013 Riesling (Washington),"An aromatic wine with gardenia, ripe nectarine and honey. It's medium-plus sweet with jasmine and stone fruit flavors with the grape's natural acidity playing along nicely."
US,87,28,Syrah,red,Chatter Creek 2006 Lonesome Spring Ranch Syrah (Yakima Valley),"True to past vintages, this is a peppery Syrah from a cooler site, putting the accent on very tart and tight fruit flavors of wild berries and aromatic herbs. It's well balanced and the tannins are reasonably ripe, with good grip."
US,85,15,Riesling,white,Treleaven 2011 Dry Riesling (Cayuga Lake),"Smoke and musk notes dissipate with aeration to reveal aromas of ripe stone fruit and floral tones. The palate is dry and intensely tart with a piercing lemon-lime acidity. It's a focused, rather linear wine with a steely, mineral finish."
Italy,92,30,Sangiovese,red,Casa al Vento 2013 Aria  (Chianti Classico),"This pure expression of Sangiovese offers classic varietal aromas of red berry, plum, violet and a whiff of dark cooking spice. The vibrant palate offers juicy black cherry, ripe raspberry, white pepper, anise and a hint of tobacco. Bright acidity and polished tannins provide the framework. Enjoy 2016–2020."
Italy,93,96,Red Blend,red,Tenuta delle Terre Nere 2006 Prephylloxera La Vigna di Don Peppino  (Etna),"Mount Etna's Don Peppino vineyard is responsible for some of the volcano's most precious and highest quality fruit. This wine opens with a light hue and delicate aromas of violets, white almonds, cranberries and fresh plums. The nose is polished and refined. It's hard to believe that sucha violent volcano can produce such a feminine wine."
US,91,39,Chardonnay,white,Viansa 2007 Cento per Cento Chardonnay (Carneros),"Very ripe and Burgundian in the wealth of flamboyant pineapples, guavas, minerals, buttered toast, crème brûlée and vanilla, wrapped into a creamy, leesy texture. A bit unfocused now, and should be best by the Fall of 2009."
Italy,87,20,Chardonnay,white,Cà del Vént NV Brut Chardonnay (Franciacorta),There's a spicy element of clove or cinnamon (25% of the wine is aged in oak) that is followed by stone fruit and bitter almond. Tonic effervescence and crisp acidity would help pair this wine with quiche.
US,91,35,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Carneros 2006 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This bottling has been getting steadily richer and better over the years and has now reached the point where it's an authentic Carneros beauty. The '06 is a Pinot Noir to drink now, to savor its rasp-berry and cherry freshness, crispness and silky texture."
US,90,50,Syrah,red,Carr 2009 Morehouse Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"This Syrah is considerably lighter in body than you'd expect for a variety that's often heavy and full bodied. It has the silkiness of a Pinot Noir, and it's dry and complex in wild berry, leather, black pepper and cedar flavors. It shows lots of elegance throughout, and could even pick up bottle notes over the next six years."
Italy,84,13,Pinot Grigio,white,La di Motte 2010 Pinot Grigio (Venezie),"There's a generous, sunny quality to this Italian Pinot Grigio that comes across with ripe aromas of apricot, melon and Golden Delicious apple. There's a fullness to the mouthfeel as well with soft, slightly sweet fruit flavors at the end."
US,91,85,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Chimney Rock 2014 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"This Cabernet Sauvignon, with 11% Merlot added, offers intense ripeness and a plush texture of soft tannins. Rich blackberry jam and chocolate flavors are layered with soy and leather notes, benefitting from integrated oak."
US,92,60,Pinot Noir,red,Wild Horse 2008 Cheval Sauvage Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Lightly silky, this has mouth-cleansing acidity and delicious red-cherry pie, spice and sandalwood flavors. It's really easy to drink now, elegant and complex. You can even give it a little chill on a hot night."
US,94,70,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Serene 2012 Evenstad Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This includes grapes from the winery's Jerusalem Hill vineyard in the Eola-Amity Hills AVA, in addition to the Dundee Hills sites, hence the more general Willamette Valley designation. It was aged in 65% new French oak for 16 months. It's open and generous, offering bright berry, cherry and red currant fruit matched to defining acids, all set in a fine-tuned frame of new oak. Re-tasted 24 hours after being opened, it remained fresh, dense and satisfying."
US,88,55,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Valley Legend 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Scads of ripe blackberry, blueberry, cherry and Cocoa Puff fruit flavors on this Cabernet, which is also rich in sweet, buttery oak. It's delicious by definition, yet the modern style could use some restraint."
US,84,33,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Grey Stack 2012 Dry Stack Vineyard Rosemary's Block Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"Nice acidity and clean varietal flavors of citrus and tropical fruit, apricot and peach mark this slightly oaky wine. There's a white sugar note throughout, however, that turns cloying after a sip or two."
US,86,32,Red Blend,red,Banknote 2009 The Vault Red (Napa Valley),"A rustic but tasty wine, this has blackberry, currant, tobacco and cedar flavors. Made from Zinfandel, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon in roughly equal proportions, it's dry, tannic and meant to be consumed now."
US,83,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Rutherford Ranch 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Sweet and simple, this features fruit-juice-like flavors of orange, pineapple and apricot. A great big burst of lemony acidity saves it."
France,89,34,Pinot Noir,red,Château Philippe-le-Hardi 2010 Les Puillets Premier Cru  (Mercurey),"This has a firm edge of tannins along with dense red fruits. It's structured and balanced, with the texture and acidity that suggest its aging potential. Give this 3–4 years."
US,90,75,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Westerly 2011 Fletcher's Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"Winemaker Adam Henkel inherited this vintage's barrels, but puts together a tasty blend, showing cracked peppercorns, obsidian-like rocks, layers of blackberry and a slight hint of green pepper. Pasilla chile opens the palate, which unfolds with boysenberry and blackberry, staying evenly balanced the entire sip."
France,90,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château de Lavagnac 2011 La Grande Dame du Château de Lavagnac  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"This is an attractive, aromatic wine, full of fruitiness and soft tannins. There is a strongly juicy element with black currant fruits adding freshness. There is a touch of spice from wood aging. Drink this enjoyable wine now."
France,93,145,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Leflaive 2009 Clavoillon Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),"A deliciously fruity wine, its bright apricot, pineapple and peach flavors open and generous. Of course, there is a more serious core of structure, lemon zest and dryness to promise aging. At the end, though, fruit and a light toastiness give immediate pleasure."
US,93,50,Chardonnay,white,De Loach 2014 Ritchie Vineyard Middle Reach Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Stony minerality surrounds sublime texture in this full-bodied, balanced expression of the appellation's Middle Reach neighborhood, an area known for producing wines of great beauty and subtle power. Apple, pear and richer characteristics of stone fruit are succulent on the palate, while a racy spiciness intrigues."
US,90,45,Chardonnay,white,Sleeping Giant 2014 Las Amigas Partners Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),"Tropical vanilla and pineapple notes provide this full-bodied wine with voluptuous fruit and texture. That ripeness finds its equilibrium on the midpalate, settling down into lemon peel and quince highlights that finish bright."
US,91,67,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Trione 2012 Block Twenty One Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"This classically styled red with 9% Merlot and 2% each of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot impresses with perfumed violet and its soft, smooth and succulent black cherry and currant flavor. Approachable and round, it has cedar and mocha undertones that make it memorable and compelling."
US,88,32,Zinfandel,red,Mazzocco 2007 West Dry Creek Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Mazzocco's Zins are dependably superripe and high in alcohol. This '07 is a big, strong wine, offering flavors of blackberry and blueberry jam, spread onto buttered white toast and sprinkled with anisette. It's delicious and heady."
France,93,53,Riesling,white,Domaine Gresser 2011 Wiebelsberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),The nose is like a veil of Golden Delicious apple scent. The palate follows with soft apple freshness that is pervaded by a deeper lemony streak. But it is apple charm that stays on the surface. There are hints of wax and stone too. The dry intense palate is concentrated and clean. Apple and lemon notes linger and leave the palate utterly clean.
France,87,12,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Eric Louis 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France),"Although the producer is based in Sancerre, this wine has an almost southern warmth to it. Its orange blossom aromas, rich tropical fruit flavors and balanced acidity make it ripe and ready to drink now."
US,91,17,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Rodney Strong 2015 Estate Vineyards Charlotte's Home Sauvignon Blanc (Northern Sonoma),"A strong whiff of oak opens this wine before blowing off to reveal complementary aromas and flavors of mango, peach and melon accented by fresh-cut grass and honeysuckle. Mostly stainless-steel fermented, with just 10% of the wine given time in barrel, it remains crisp and clean, with just the right amount of texture and body."
Italy,90,23,Sangiovese,red,Sesta di Sopra 2012  Rosso di Montalcino,"Round and smooth, this delivers sensations of strawberry, wild cherry, raspberry, pine forest, menthol and cake spices. The concentrated flavors are balanced by supple tannins and fresh acidity. Enjoy this over the next few years."
US,91,50,Pinot Noir,red,Hartford 1999 Sevens Bench Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Toastier and smokier than the other bottlings, with clove and coffee accents dressing up sturdy plum and earth flavors. Finishes long, with hints of tart plum skin and dusty tannins. Seems as if rare duck breast would be a perfect match."
US,87,60,Pinot Noir,red,Torii Mor 2011 Olson Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Among the early releases of the 2011 single-vineyard Pinots from Torii Mor, the Olson seems to be the one that had the most difficulty achieving full ripeness. Scents and flavors are focused upon green tea, peppery herbs, even a suggestion of fiddlehead ferns. The fruit reaches rhubarb-level ripeness and remains there, but the balance and structure are first-rate."
US,90,27,Chardonnay,white,William Hill Estate 2013 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Aromas of orange blossom and jasmine intoxicate on the entry of this delightful wine, which combines in complex ways to offer savory fennel with a creaminess to the texture. That complexity continues through the finish, which ends long and lean."
France,92,29,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Clos Haut-Peyraguey 2014 Symphonie  (Sauternes),"Rich and dense, this generous wine has considerable botrytis as well as perfumed apricot and bitter orange flavors. It's ripe and full of fruit and honey. Drink from 2020."
US,92,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,J. Bookwalter 2014 Protagonist Conner-Lee Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas are quite reserved, with notes of cherry, herb, smoke and graphite. The black-fruit flavors, in contrast, are rich and full, bringing a sense of hedonism. It brings plenty of appeal now but should bring even more if the aromas open up."
US,91,20,Red Blend,red,75 Wine Co. 2007 The Sum Red (Napa Valley),"Rich and dramatic, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petite Sirah offers smooth, unctuous flavors of cherries, black raspberries, chocolate and pepper. It's a seductively appealing wine, with thick, refined tannins and a dry finish. Should gain in the bottle over the next 4–6 years. Great price for the quality."
US,83,20,Red Blend,red,Harry & David 2014 Ross Lane Red (Southern Oregon),"Among the components are Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, with one-quarter of the blend listed simply as “more.” It's dark in hue and light in flavor, with thin citrus flavors dominating."
France,94,42,Riesling,white,Domaine Weinbach 2011 Cuvée Ste Catherine Riesling (Alsace),"This is a beautifully perfumed wine, that, while rich with fruit, maintains a crisp, steely and tight youthfulness. It's juicy character floods the palate. It's clearly a wine to age, so don't drink before 2016."
US,88,35,Syrah,red,Epiphany 2011 Paradise Road Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"This begins with aromas of herb-crusted, charred pork belly, graphite and shaved wood. A touch of black fruit lingers in the background of the palate, but the stars are black pepper, licorice, hard herbs, black soot, asphalt and very grippy tannins. Wait at least until 2016 for some mellowing."
US,93,95,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hartwell 1997 Sunshine Vyd Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"The word ""black"" applies to a number of things here: cherry, coffee, currant. Cola is another part of the fabulous mix. Tons of polish, and creamy and rich. A palate-pleaser supreme; there's a lot of class and breed here. Fine and fancy, with excellent weight. What more could you ask for?"
US,91,22,Pinot Noir,red,Cambiata 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Concentrated black plum and violet notes mesh with potting soil, cola and a candied black-raspberry character on the nose of this bottling. The palate combines boysenberry with woody elderberry fruit as well as a warmer red cherry and red-plum core, edged by pine needles, juniper and tart pomegranate complexity."
US,88,40,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Girard 2012 Artistry Red (Napa Valley),"Herbaceous on the entry, this Cabernet Sauvignon-majority blend has traces of each of the other red Bordeaux varieties. Blackberry and tobacco follow suit, building to a full-bodied experience of highly walled tannins that mellow to a smooth finish."
Italy,87,17,Red Blend,red,Baglio di Pianetto 2009 Shymer Red (Sicilia),"As its hybrid name suggests, Shymer is a blend of Syrah and Merlot. The wine presents a friendly bouquet accented by red cherry, white pepper and sweet cinnamon. The tannins are soft and plush."
US,88,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Raymond 2004 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Here's an intense, nervy young Cab that impresses for its powerful oak and cassis flavors. It's a little sharp now, with an acidic jamminess and tea-like tannic structure that suggests moderate aging capability. Stash it until 2008, then open for a couple of years."
US,93,50,Syrah,red,Sanguis 2011 Misfit Syrah (Central Coast),"A whirlwind of aromas—peppered black cherries, elderberry, caramel, toast, barrel smoke—rise off this appellation blend from German-born winemaker Matthias Pippig, who handcrafts small batches on Santa Barbara's Eastside. It's very soft on the palate, with medium-dark flavors of butter-crusted plum pie and an herbal note of pine pitch keeping it serious."
US,89,49,Pinot Noir,red,Winter's Hill 2015 Block 10 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Pure Pommard, this has more concentration and forward fruit than the other single-block wines in this series. A pleasing mix of strawberry, raspberry and cherry flavors, along with a dash of flat seltzer, it carries through clean and refreshing to a moderately long finish with a hint of herb."
US,88,30,Pinot Noir,red,Kenneth Volk 2011 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Starting with the strawberry syrup nose so common in Pinot Noirs from the Santa Maria Valley, this tasty, approachable wine quickly comes across as more fun than pensive, with aromas bordering on Hawaiian Punch. It's very smooth once sipped, showing a bit more raspberry than strawberry on the palate, with some yeastiness and zing as well."
US,96,52,Pinot Noir,red,Roark Wine Co. 2014 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"The fascinating nose of this wine is reason enough to seek it out—an aromatic display of underripe raspberry, tart pomegranate, fresh dill, eucalyptus and sage. Montmorency cherry notes show on the palate, along with mace, Vietnamese cinnamon and fennel. A unique, refreshing and memorable wine."
Italy,86,16,White Blend,white,Tenuta del Buonamico 2011 White (Montecarlo),"Trebbiano, Sémillon, Roussanne, Sauvignon and Pinot Bianco form this unique blend. It offers subtle tones of peach, pineapple and honeysuckle."
US,85,14,Chardonnay,white,River Road 2011 Un-Oaked Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"This unoaked effort sure tastes sweet, with flavors of sugared orange, mango and apple juice. The acidity is fine, giving balance to the sweetness."
Italy,85,55,Red Blend,red,Lunadoro 2008 Quercione Riserva  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"This opens with aromas of oak, tire rubber, fennel and underbrush. The palate is dominated by oak and oak-driven spices alongside a confectionary note and green, astringent tannins. It lacks fruit richness."
France,88,34,Riesling,white,Domaine Vincent Stoeffler 2014 Muhlforst Riesling (Alsace),"Earth and apple notes unite to make this juicy, fresh and sprightly Riesling. The style is dry, helped by a slight phenolic grip and that characteristic, lime-lemon acidity that brightens everything."
France,90,30,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Maucamps 2012  Haut-Médoc,"Maucamps is situated in Macau, just south of Margaux, giving it a stylish character. It has weight, of course, but this is given perspective by the structured black fruits and supporting tannin. A dry core will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2018."
US,89,45,Chardonnay,white,Hunnicutt 2011 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"A rich, ripe Chardonnay, made to appeal to the popular style. Shows tons of pineapple, peach, green apple, buttered toast, cream and honey flavors, balanced with crisp acidity."
France,86,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Cheval Quancard 2015 Fleur du Roc  (Saint-Émilion),"This is a structured wine, juicy with black-currant fruit and acidity. It will develop quickly, softening its tannins and filling out with ripe fruit. Drink from 2018."
US,88,15,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Ross Andrew 2012 The Huntsman Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"An appealing wine with notes of coffee, blueberry and plum, with the aromas giving a suggestion of confection. The palate doesn't hang together end to end but it still provides plenty of enjoyment."
US,92,22,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Januik 2012 Sagemoor Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This fresh, young wine, showcases a palate-thrilling mix of ripe tree fruits—sappy apples, juicy citrus—and some hints of pineapple as well. The ripeness turns the lemony fruit into limoncello, and the finish is long and wonderfully refreshing."
US,95,275,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,BOND 2005 Melbury Red (Napa Valley),"Lots of fresh herbs and spices in this beautiful red wine. Offers loads of red and black currants and chocolate, with a fine application of cedar and cigar box from oak. Very fine, enormously likeable. Drink now through 2015."
US,85,35,Zinfandel,red,Rock Wall 2009 Westphall Ridge Vineyard Rockpile Road Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"A somewhat rustic wine, edgy in tannins and not quite ripe yet jammy at the same time, with olive, herb, blackberry and oak flavors. The spices are the nicest part."
US,90,24,Red Blend,red,Owen Roe 2013 Abbot's Table Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of Zinfandel (41%), Sangiovese (34%), Lemberger (9%), Malbec (11%) and Merlot, this appealing wine suggests plum, currant and red fruit. It's supple in feel with cranberry and raspberry flavors backed by tart acidity."
US,87,100,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Kathryn Hall Vineyards 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"The winery made its bones with its fabulous Sacrashe Cabernet from Rutherford. This is their first release from Diamond Mountain, and the result is quite interesting. In fact, it's very good, but disappointing, considering the price. The wine is firm and hard in tannins, with blackberry, currant and new oak flavors, yet it's a little lacking in depth. Could be an ager, but don't bet the farm."
France,92,75,Chardonnay,white,Château de Fuissé 2014 Les Brûlés  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"While the name means “burnt,” it really refers to the southern exposure of this warm vineyard. Wood aged in new barrels, this wine has a toasty character that is well balanced by the rich fruits. Acidity and a mineral texture give this wine aging potential. Drink from 2017."
US,88,42,Red Blend,red,Phelps Creek 2007 Cuvée Alexandrine Red (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"This cuvée is the product of a collaboration between Phelps Creek owner Bob Morus and Burgundian winemaker Alexandrine Roy. She has crafted an elegant wine with unusual nuances—hints of bacon fat and butter, lightly woven into the tart, racy pomegranate and raspberry fruit. Elegant and refined, this is as Burgundian as Oregon Pinot ever gets."
Italy,92,56,Sangiovese,red,Tenuta di Argiano 1997  Brunello di Montalcino,"The large 246-acre estate is owned by Countess Noemi Cinzano, of the vermouth family. With Giacomo Tachis as consultant, the vineyard has produced a powerful, rich wine that combines dryness, bitter fruits and dark tannins with generous tarry, super-ripe fruit that promises to come through and dominate as the wine ages. Drink after 7–8 years."
US,92,22,Chardonnay,white,Amalie Robert 2013 Her Silhouette Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Here is an outstanding stainless-fermented Chardonnay, thick and fruity. It's totally loaded with ripe apple and pear-pastry goodness, and the flavors dive deep into a thoroughly delicious, textural finish."
US,92,30,Chardonnay,white,Baileyana 2006 Grand Firepeak Cuvée Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"This is Baileyana's top Chardonnay, and the '06 defines what makes Edna Valley such a special place to grow it. Acidity and ripeness are the stars, with bright, explosive flavors of pineapples, pears, Meyer lemons, limes and kiwi fruits. The smoky, spicy oak is perfectly integrated into this delightful wine."
France,91,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Hyot 2014  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"This is a ripe, fruity wine with its black-currant fruit and balanced sweet tannins. It has a fine elegant texture and juicy acidity. All these elements promise a wine that will be delicious to drink from 2019. The daughters of owners Bernadette Faure and Alain Aubert oversee vineyards, winemaking and marketing."
US,94,54,Syrah,red,Testarossa 2009 Garys' Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Testarossa is better known for Pinot Noir, but their Syrahs, and particularly those from Garys' Vineyard, are some of the best around. This 2009 is delectable now for its sheer drinkability. It's rich and luscious in blackberry, blueberry, smoked meat, pepper and earthy tobacco flavors, wrapped into smooth, complex tannins."
US,84,20,Sangiovese,red,Ingleside 2014 Rosato di Sangiovese (Virginia),Sour cherry and underripe watermelon show on the nose and palate. A 15% addition of Merlot gives a slight impression of weight to this otherwise light-bodied sipper.
US,95,45,Pinot Noir,red,Failla 2009 Keefer Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Failla has been working with the fruit from this coveted vineyard for a long time, and has figured it out better than anyone. How they take basic Russian River Valley cherry, raspberry and cola flavors and uplift the wine into the extraordinarily exotic is inexplicable. But they do. An amazingly complex, compelling young Pinot Noir. Drink now–2019, at least."
US,87,35,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Serene 1999 Cote Sud Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This seems a bit overripe in the nose; definitely an ultraripe style, with flavors of peach, apricot and mango. Real tropical, still has decent acids, but the fruit went a bit too far, and there is a definite sweetness too, along with some breakfast toast oak."
US,92,45,Red Blend,red,L'Aventure 2001 Optimus Red (Paso Robles),"From Rhône-possessed Paso Robles, an adventurous blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Petit Verdot and Zinfandel. The aroma is subdued now, closed and brooding. On the palate is an explosion of cassis, briar, chocolate and coffee. Sweet, ripe tannins make for a dusty mouthfeel. Needs a minimum of a year in the cellar."
US,86,17,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Napa Cellars 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Oaky and robust, this wine takes on a confectionery route to tropical flavor and high-octane concentration, offering a thickness of texture and body. Stainless-steel fermented, it unveils secondary flavors of lime and white peach on the finish."
France,92,145,Pinot Noir,red,Bouchard Père & Fils 2007 Aux Malconsorts Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée),"A tannins-dominated wine, firm and dry. The fruit is relatively subdued, with a juicy character of raspberries, red plum skins and crisp acidity. This is a wine that needs aging to soften those tannins: give it 4–5 years."
US,90,48,Pinot Noir,red,Hug 2007 Boulder Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"This low-production Pinot doesn't leave much to the imagination. It's all about fruit. Cherries, raspberries, currants, cola, root beer and pepper flood the mouth, housed in a crisply dry, savory mouthfeel. Could develop bottle complexities over the next six years."
US,85,21,Chardonnay,white,10 Knots 2006 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"Oaky influences give this wine a candied taste of caramel and lime pie, on top of the grapier flavors of pineapples and pears. It's solidly in the mode of what Americans want in a Chardonnay."
France,87,18,Chardonnay,white,Louis Max 2014  Mâcon-Villages,"Tight and structured, this wine has minerality as well as tangy lemon character. It has a crisp side, with citrus fruits and attractive acidity. The aftertaste is bright with freshness."
US,90,44,Chardonnay,white,Cuvaison 2014 Kite Tail Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Honeyed apple crisp and salty pretzel pave the way for a complex, compelling wine, the acidity high and the floral apple blossom and nutmeg intriguing. The middle shows a youthful tease of impermanence before finishing strong."
US,85,32,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Breaux 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Virginia),"A broad black-fruit scent defines this Cabernet Sauvignon, with muffled hints of blueberry, toast and cheese rind. The palate is marked by strapping tannins that tug on the upperlip, bearing flavors of toast and coffee bean."
US,85,29,Merlot,red,The Magpie 2009 Lot Five Merlot (Bennett Valley),"At four years of age, this Merlot is as good as it will ever be. It's rustic in texture, with some sharp edges, and ripe raspberry, cherry and cola flavors."
US,87,42,Syrah,red,La Chanterelle 2012 Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"New oak takes the lead on the nose of this wine, with notes of vanilla and toffee followed by cranberry and cherry. It's high octane, with a concentrated cherry flavor and alcoholic warmth."
US,81,13,Riesling,white,Fulkerson 2010 Reserve Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Smoke wafts amidst savory notes of apple on this dry, slightly bitter Riesling. Crisp lemony acidity lends refreshment on the palate."
US,87,16,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Hosmer 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Cayuga Lake),"Fresh apple, pear and tangerine flavors revitalize the palate in this crisp, approachable Sauvignon Blanc. It's uncomplicated yet elegant, finishing on a penetrating streak of lemon-lime acidity."
US,88,24,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Bench 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"This is a soft, well-integrated wine with a full-throttle backbone of cedar and cranberry that drinks easily and is ready for the table. Priced attractively, it offers value for the quality and broad appeal."
France,90,33,Chardonnay,white,Olivier Leflaive 2014 Oncle Vincent  (Bourgogne),"This is a beautifully aromatic wine with toast and yellow fruits mingling easily together. It is ripe while also light to taste, a crisp burst of acidity giving the wine a fine lift. Yellow fruits, citrus and toast play together in this attractive wine that is ready to drink."
Italy,87,40,Sangiovese,red,Il Poggiolo 2009 Bramante  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Opening aromas include exotic incense, oak, baking spices and baked black plum. The palate reveals restrained black cherry and espresso flavors but the fruit is already fading and can't support the bitter, drying tannins."
France,85,14,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château la Petite Roque 2011  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"An attractive, fruity wine with black-currant and red-berry juiciness followed by a lightly tannic character. It's a classic for the vintage—light and fruity."
Italy,86,10,Red Blend,red,Tenute Girolamo 2013 La Voliera Red (Salice Salentino),"Aromas of underbrush, grilled mushroom, blue flower and menthol lead the nose. The linear palate offers dried plum, mature blackberry, espresso and licorice while firm tannins provide support. It finishes on a note of graphite."
Italy,89,70,Red Blend,red,Castellare di Castellina 2009 I Sodi di San Niccolò Red (Toscana),"A blend of Sangiovese and Malvasia, this wine conveys aromas of espresso, roasted coffee bean, black fruit and mint. The palate offers oak, vanilla, toast, coffee, black cherry, black pepper and grilled balsamic herbs. It's soft and already accessible. Drink now through 2019."
US,91,60,Pinot Noir,red,Black Kite 2013 Redwood's Edge Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This wine is bold and full bodied, big enough for a grilled steak, with powerful ripe fruit flavors like black cherry and blackberry. Firm-enough tannins add grip to the texture, with slightly smoky, peppery accents on the finish."
US,92,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Vine Cliff 2001 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This complex and distinctive wine is dark and brooding, and reveals itself reluctantly through an elaborate overlay of well-toasted oak. Below all that char and vanilla is polished blackcurrant and cassis fruit. The sweet tannins and weight of the wine are pedigreed, but there's a rawness that demands cellaring. Best beyond 2008."
US,87,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Donati 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paicines),"Dry and crisp, this is elegant, with a silky mouthfeel carrying flavors of sour blackberry candy and cranberrys. It has a certain complexity that's pleasurable."
US,90,50,Syrah,red,Spring Valley Vineyard 2014 Nina Lee Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Aromas of asphalt, herb, cracked pepper and dark fruit lead to full-bodied fruit flavors. It sails on the finish."
US,87,21,Sangiovese,red,Stella Fino 2007 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This 100% Sangiovese has interesting aromatics, with a pine ester high note over the light strawberry-scented fruit. There is an earthy underpinning; overall a pleasant quaffer with a bit more heft than the winery's other reds."
US,86,26,Zinfandel,red,Wilderotter 2012 Estate Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"This medium-bodied wine is easy-going and easy to drink. It smells and tastes like raspberries and red grapes, feels soft in texture and has a mellow fruitiness."
US,90,25,Syrah,red,Firestone 2009 Syrah (Central Coast),"Distinguished in its texture, this Syrah boasts smooth, complex tannins and a bright burst of acidity, which provides the framework for rich flavors of blackberries, plums, bacon and spices. Drink soon for its youthful vigor."
US,91,29,Chardonnay,white,DanCin 2015 Capriccio Chardonnay (Southern Oregon),"This lush wine, green/gold in hue, offers mouth-coating flavors with richness and style. Apple, pear and papaya fruit holds down the center, with elements of toasted hazelnuts and butter pecan from aging in 20% new French oak. The creamy, smooth finish is delightful."
France,82,11,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Mont Tauch 2009 Le Dog de Christophe Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de Pays d'Oc),"Ripe raspberry, spicy red plum and licorice unfold on the nose, while soft flavors of cassis chime in on the palate. Light weight and watery with a short finish."
US,95,150,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Yao Ming 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This fabulous Cabernet has been blended with Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot. It's incredibly complex in both flavor and structure, offering waves of blackberries and cherries, currants, dark chocolate and toast that go on and on into a long, spicy finish. The grapes come from various sources, including St. Helena and Atlas Peak, showing winemaker Tom Hinde's mastery of the art of blending."
US,84,9,Chardonnay,white,Covey Run 2008 Quail Series Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A solid, all-purpose wine, this has some toast and vanilla components, along with straightforward fruit that hints at green apple. There's a little spice and butter in the aromas also."
US,91,25,Red Blend,red,Whitehall Lane 2012 Tre Leoni Red (Napa Valley),"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot, this is soft and sublime. The Cab and Syrah influences charge through the dense, substantial tannins and meatier notes of leather, cigar box and oak."
US,82,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Sera Fina 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Sierra Foothills),"This unoaked wine is tart and simple, with sweet and sour flavors of oranges and pineapples, like fruit juice with alcohol."
US,88,28,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Del Rio 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rogue Valley),"This unusual and quite distinctive Cabernet Sauvignon makes a strong case for the specificity of the Rogue Valley in relation to this international grape. Pungently herbal, yet neither stemmy nor vegetal, this lights up the nose with penetrating, resinous scents. In the mouth it's mostly reminiscent of high altitude Argentine wines—rock, acid, spice and red currant—a product, no doubt of the 1200 foot vineyard site, which is littered with river rock."
US,93,52,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Andrew Will 2011 Champoux Vineyard Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"The most immediately accessible of Will's three Horse Heaven Hills wines, it brings notes of scorched earth, herbs, incense, toast and abundant dark fruit. The palate is densely packed with dark fruit, tart acids and firm, tightly coiled tannins with a beautiful sense of balance. A classically styled wine that should have a healthy life in front of it."
US,86,19,Zinfandel,red,Navarro 2007 Zinfandel (Mendocino),"ots of briary, brambly wild berry and cherry fruit in this robust Zin. Also lots of mouthwatering spices. It's basically dry, but jammy sweet also, suggesting pairing with barbecue sauces made with sugar."
US,88,26,Pinot Noir,red,Proulx 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"Cherry-raspberry notes show on the nose of this appellation blend from a Paso producer, along with eucalyptus and cedar. The palate is straightforward, with cranberry, raspberry, pencil lead and a bit of tar."
France,96,115,Pinot Noir,red,Bouchard Père & Fils 2011 Le Corton  (Corton),"This is powerful and rich, allowing just a note of freshness to creep into the firm structure. Dark tannins, black fruits and smoky wood flavors combine harmoniously, lending a sense of great power and long-term aging potential. Drink from 2019."
US,86,32,Pinot Noir,red,Rusack 2001 Reserve Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Marginally riper and plusher than Rusack's other two Pinots, but not by a lot. This is still a lean, earthy wine, short on flavor and long on acidity and tannins. Sift through the herbal, bay leaf and sage tastes and you'll find a note of cherry. Aging may help."
France,93,110,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Vieux Château Mazerat 2008  Saint-Émilion,"Very intense wine, packed with dark tannins, solid and powerful. It is leavened with great perfumes, while the overall effect is dark, brooding and concentrated."
US,88,40,Pinot Noir,red,Lucia 2011 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is a darkly colored, rich wine that's uniquely savory. It floods the mouth with raspberry and cherry jam, mocha and sweet oak flavors. Best for drinking soon."
US,85,9,Merlot,red,Happy Camper 2010 Merlot (California),"Although it's a little slender and simple, it's good for the price and offers pleasant cherry and spice flavors that finish dry."
US,88,48,Pinot Noir,red,Le Cadeau 2011 Rocheux Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This comes from estate-grown fruit in the Chehalem Mountains AVA. Spicy and sharp-toned, it brings tart acidity and highlights of orange peel to flavors of wild mountain berries. The tannins are still a bit rough, but should smooth out with more bottle age."
US,94,60,Pinot Noir,red,Merry Edwards 2013 Meredith Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"From the producer's Sebastopol Hills hillside vineyard, this is a perfumy, elegant wine, a combination of lavender and roses with sizable tannins and a backbone of acidity. Dark black fruit and game swirl together with a complex addition of dried herb and violet. This is a lovely wine now, but will benefit from further cellaring through 2023."
US,92,38,Pinot Noir,red,Saracina 2012 Klindt Vineyards Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This is smooth and harmonious from the dark color, to the baritone aromas of black cherry and cassis, to the rather full body, rich texture and firm tannins. Not too big and not too oaky, but well balanced for its impressive breadth of flavor."
US,96,60,Pinot Noir,red,Patricia Green Cellars 2015 Estate Vineyard Etzel Block Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"Named after neighboring winery owner Mike Etzel (Beaux Frères), this exceptional wine is brilliantly focused and rippling with muscular depth. The palate is etched with blackberry and black cherry fruit, immersed in lush vanilla, coffee and caramel tones. It's instantly gratifying, impossibly seductive and exceptional in every way."
US,91,28,Zinfandel,red,Ridge 2010 Ponzo Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),This will divide the Zinfandel community. Some will find its earthiness and herbaceousness an attractive complication to the briary berry and spice notes. Others will think it's not quite ripe enough and lacking richness. The score reflects the wine's complexity and adaptability to a wide range of foods.
US,83,16,Chardonnay,white,Ca' Momi 2010 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Too oaky, with dominating tastes of buttered toast that swamp the pineapple and orange fruit. The oak follows through in a sweet, caramelized finish."
US,88,32,Pinot Noir,red,Seagrape 2010 Jump Up Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"With juicy acidity and tart flavors of cranberries and sour-cherry candy, this is a Pinot Noir to drink now. It's dry and a little austere, but rich beef and lamb dishes will coax out the fruit."
Italy,92,500,Red Blend,red,Gaja 2011 Sorì Tildin Red (Langhe),"Aromas of crushed plum, asphalt, oak, toast, exotic spice and forest floor lead the nose. The palate delivers black cherry, mocha, licorice and mineral alongside bracing, tightly woven tannins that need time to unwind. Drink 2017–2031."
US,86,25,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Coyote Canyon 2012 Tres Cruces Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"This wine's barrel spice, barnyard, coffee and vanilla aromas lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors tinged with a strong, distracting gamy note."
France,89,18,Pinot Gris,white,Domaine Rieflé-Landmann 2014 Bonheur Convivial Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Creamy, ripe pear fruit signals a pliable, rich wine. There is some palpable warmth amid the generous pear notes that are held in check by fresh, zesty acidity. The body does not come across as heavy but as a lovely interplay of ripe pear and zesty citrus."
US,87,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Heritance 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Kiwi, peach and pineapple mark this blend of 93% Sauvignon Blanc and 7% Sémillon, providing a tropical character and personality. Medium in body and weight, it finishes moderately influenced by oak and a touch of vanilla cream."
US,83,14,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Pavillion Crossing 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"This might be an example of a wine that's too low in alcohol (13.1%). Two bottles were tasted and both came off as very soft and a tad bland, even waxy."
US,91,42,Syrah,red,Trust 2013 Single Vineyard Series Lewis Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Pungent aromas of herbs, cherry cola, orange peel and dark fruit lead to well-balanced blue-fruit flavors. It shows a lot of purity and appeal as well as good length."
France,87,17,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Lagarosse 2006  Premieres Côtes de Bordeaux,"Under the ownership of American Stephen Adams, this estate is showing promise. The wine is finely structured, a smoky bacon element mingling well with fresh red plum and firm tannins. The core is dry, solid, showing wood, finishing with vivid minerality and acidity."
US,85,16,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Beringer 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Tangy acidity is the star here. It gives structure and backbone to the lemon, lime, pineapple and fig flavors, and makes the wine a great cocktail sipper."
France,93,94,Pinot Noir,red,Meurgey-Croses 2015 Domaine Clos de la Chapelle Les Chanlins-Bas Premier Cru  (Pommard),"This is a ripe rounded wine, backed by the firm tannins that mark Pommard. It is bold, ripe with plenty of concentrated red fruits and finishing acidity. The wine has a crisp edge that lifts the tannins. Drink from 2023."
US,88,25,Chardonnay,white,Buehler 2013 Chardonnay (Carneros),"Pineapple and peach rise to the fore in this wine, a suggestion of waxy caramel apple lurking. High-toned acidity keeps it structured and clean on the palate, a zesty mix of orange and lemon weaving throughout the soft layers. A richer bite of graham cracker finishes things off."
US,88,50,Red Blend,red,Margerum NV Amaro Red (Santa Barbara County),"Enormously sweet and soft, with glycerine, brown sugar, black cherry, white chocolate, vanilla bean and white pepper flavors, this is one of the more eccentric, heady dessert wines out there. The alcohol is ridiculously high, yet the Madeira-like sweetness balances it."
France,92,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Durfort-Vivens 2013  Margaux,"Made in a firm, solid style, this wine shows considerable potential. Pure berry flavors are prominent along with the dense tannins. It is a good wine for the difficult vintage and will be ready to drink from 2020. The estate is in the process of converting to biodynamic methods."
US,93,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Whitehall Lane 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Aloof now, this Cab holds you at a distance with its provocative tannins. But it's a very fine wine that shows real Napa pedigree. Balanced and harmonious, it features complex flavors of blackberries, cassis and cedar wood that turn sweet on the finish. Should be at its best between 2010 and 2013 and then slowly fade away."
US,92,30,Pinot Noir,red,Scott Family 2015 Dijon Clone Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco),"At first, this is plump on the nose, with cherries and warm star anise. Aromas of dried plum skins, orange rind and bitter black tea then reveal layers of complexity. Light in body and energetic on the palate, it shows strong peppery spice against the tart red fruit, making for a very lively experience."
France,90,21,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château les Tours des Verdots 2006 Red (Côtes de Bergerac),"Dominated by Merlot, but with sizable chunks of other Bordeaux grapes, this is finely polished, wood-aged wine. It has perfumed spice and dry tannins from the wood. The fruit balances well, showing wild blackberry and licorice. Age for 2–3 years."
US,90,46,Pinot Noir,red,Scar of the Sea 2012 Seven Leagues Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Deep red rose and violet florals meld with cooked meats and ripe raspberry on the nose. It's a bit dainty on the palate but full of texture, with lingering vanilla elements, some light mocha and impressive tannic grip for a 2012."
France,91,60,Pinot Noir,red,Albert Morot 2014 Bataillière Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),"This wine is big and ripe with layers of tannins and attractive fruitiness. Bright acidity comes from the strawberry and red-cherry fruit. The drier structure is integrating well, with plenty of richness behind. The wine will develop well; drink from 2019."
US,89,15,Pinot Gris,white,Willow Crest 2016 Pinot Gris (Yakima Valley),"This wine's apple, melon and pear aromas are bright and appealing. The flavors are taught and focused, with a light creaminess and lemony acidity. It's interesting overall, providing both quality and value."
US,85,18,Red Blend,red,Michael David 2009 Petite Petit Red (Lodi),"Almost black in color, this is a blend of 85% Petite Sirah, 15% Petit Verdot with a pronounced smell and taste of smoked bacon, even smoked gouda, a huge-in-the-mouth wine that's got nothing petite (or petit) about it. Its lingering tannic smokiness begs for barbecue, smoked trout or such. The label is awesome."
France,89,37,Chardonnay,white,Domaines Devillard 2015 Domaine de la Garenne  (Pouilly-Fuissé),Citrus aromas reveal this wine's essentially crisp character. Plenty of acidity balances the rich white fruits while the mineral texture adds bite to this well-made wine. It will be ready to drink from 2019.
US,92,48,Pinot Noir,red,Nagy 2010 Garey Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"On the palate, this wine is rich and complex, with flavors of dried cherry, cola, licorice, red currant and sandalwood that finish bone dry. It has lots of acidity and some sandpaper-like tannins. This should begin to develop bottle-age notes after 2016."
US,92,50,Zinfandel,red,Dutton-Goldfield 2013 Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"This is such a refreshing take on the variety, still robust and rich in body, yet possessed of firm acidity and a crispness of cherry kirsch and pomegranate. It practically shouts violets and roses on the nose, following through on the palate with a delicacy of power that's entirely surprising. The finish is a mix of allspice and white pepper."
US,88,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Laird 2013 Big Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"With apricot, orange, peach, lemon and lime flavors, this is one of the richer Sauvignon Blancs out there. But it's totally dry, with brisk acidity and a clean, elegant finish."
US,85,25,Zinfandel,red,"Bella Piazza 2009 Sleeper Vineyard, Old Vine Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA))","This thick, dusty and leathery Foothills Zinfandel is ready to drink now with bold, meaty foods."
US,88,55,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2011 Artemis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A majority Cabernet Sauvignon with 14% Merlot blended in, Artemis is aromatically inviting in dark plum, currant and a streak of herb. Light, lean and well-balanced, the wine features soft, barely perceptible tannins. Tri-tip is a wise pairing suggestion."
US,88,32,Pinot Noir,red,Portalupi 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Cherry liqueur akin to kirsch rises aromatically, along with a lavender perfume. Light and high-strung, this is a tightly wound wine, punched in acidity and savory tea. The finish displays bold swathes of oak."
France,91,82,Chardonnay,white,Louis Jadot 2013  Puligny-Montrachet,"With spice and wood right up front, this wine is toasty and rich. It has a creamy texture along with bright acidity and a generous body. The wine, with its smooth, ripe aftertaste, is of course young. Drink from 2017."
US,87,36,Syrah,red,Wapato Point Cellars 2008 Cougar Ridge Reserve Syrah (Lake Chelan),"This is a strong wine, dark and oaky, with rich flavors of licorice, toffee and espresso. The fruit is washed in Bourbon barrel flavor. It's impressively rich, but a bit overpowering."
US,88,30,Chardonnay,white,Januik 2015 Cold Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine offers light pear, citrus, cream and lees aromas. The palate is broad and lightly creamy in feel, lacking only a bit of concentration."
US,88,12,Syrah,red,Columbia Crest 2012 Grand Estates Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromatically pleasing, this suggests fresh blueberry pie, with a whiff of smoked meat. It's straightforward with huckleberry and mocha flavors, trailing slightly toward the finish."
US,87,48,Merlot,red,Bedell 2005 Reserve Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"Bedell continues to raise the bar for Long Island Merlot with this offering. A rich, savory nose of meat, leather spice and dark berry leads into a poised balance of savory spice, rich fruit, acids and tannins. The wine has a friendly brightness about it but overall, is restrained and integrated."
US,97,140,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Continuum 2007 Red (Napa Valley),"Feels fancy and important in the mouth, with pure, refined tannins housing ripe, complex flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherries, chocolate, exotic spices and sweet, smoky oak. The finish is dry but with a tinge of sweetness, like an infused blackberry liqueur, which probably is the result of high (15.3%) alcohol. Very rich and layered, and a great addition to the Napa cult pantheon. Cabernet, with Cab Franc and Petit Verdot."
US,91,60,Pinot Noir,red,Signorello 2012 Nobles Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Hugely brawny in dark blackberry, plum and cinnamon, this wine packs a punch despite its coastal influence. Black pepper and smoke provide the savory aspect, while cranberry and strawberry the softer, prettier side of the story. Drink now through 2020."
US,91,25,Pinot Noir,red,Lange 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is an outstanding value, offering rich and complex varietal character. Raspberry and cherry fruit comes with a vein of licorice, and the texture and depth emulate Willamette Valley Pinots selling for twice the cost."
France,87,23,Chardonnay,white,Château de Lavernette 2015 Les Vignes de la Roche  (Beaujolais Blanc),"Beaujolais Blanc is effectively Burgundy-type Chardonnay but from the southern neighbor Beaujolais region. This wine, with its ripe and creamy texture, has the same rich character as a Mâcon wine. It is smooth and soft from a warm vintage for white wines. Drink this wine now."
US,87,18,Red Blend,red,Amador Cellars 2009 Bunkhouse Red (Amador County),"They grow powerful grapes in parts of Amador County and this one stands out for its elevated alcohol. The mix of 70% Zinfandel and smaller helpings of Mourvèdre, Barbera, Syrah and Touriga combine for a spicy cola taste. Leathery notes and big tannins linger long on the finish."
Italy,90,17,White Blend,white,Balestri Valda 2014 Vigneto Sengialta  (Soave Classico),"Aromas of pressed honeysuckle and orchard fruit lead the nose while the vibrant savory palate doles out ripe peach, yellow apple and a hint of lemon zest. An almond note lends a pleasantly bitter finish."
France,90,28,Chardonnay,white,Evening Land 2011  Pouilly-Fuissé,"A rich, ripe wine, striated with yellow fruits, acidity and spice from wood. It is warm and generous, while not losing sight of its origins in the streak of minerality. A fine, attractive wine that could do with another year's aging."
US,87,10,Red Blend,red,Merritt NV Bella Rosa Red (New York),"Concord grapes are unmistakable for their sweet, high-toned Welch's grape jelly aromas and flavors. The Bella Rosa stays true to this bright, juicy, easy-drinking style. It's not a complex wine but delightfully quaffable."
US,89,21,Zinfandel,red,Balletto 2008 Estate Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"This wine is filled with robust Zinny flavors, ranging from wild raspberries and red currants to tobacco, mocha and crushed black pepper. It's just beginning to pick up aged notes, making it sweeter and more mellow than it would have been two or three years ago. Kudos to Balletto for holding it back before  release. Drink now–2016."
US,95,125,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Flora Springs 2010 Rennie Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"This is a tremendous wine that's packed with flavor and dramatically structured. It's made in the modern cult style of exceptionally rich and ripe with sweet, toasty oak, and delicious blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and anise. The tannins are strong, but refined. Begin popping the cork in eight years, and this beauty could still be going strong in 2028, maybe beyond."
US,82,20,Chardonnay,white,F.J. Serra 2011 Chardonnay (California),"This tastes seemingly sweet, like a candy bar of honey, orange extract, vanilla and roasted almonds."
US,84,25,Chardonnay,white,Baiting Hollow Farm Vineyard 2010 Horse Rescue Angel Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),"The palate is subdued with modest apple and lemon notes, but brisk lemon-lime acidity and a hint of white florals adds some complexity. Dry and full bodied on the palate, it's an easy white to accompany everyday dinners of fish or chicken."
US,89,28,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Foxen 2014 7200 Vogelzang VIneyard Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"Very approachable and easygoing aromatics invite the nose with salted lime, yellow apples and buttery strudel scents. The palate is equally smooth and tasty, with warm apple and lemon-brioche flavors and a creamy mouthfeel. This is a full-body take on the grape rather than lean and grassy."
US,92,34,Pinot Noir,red,Williams Selyem 2008 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"Although this is the least costly of the winery's Pinots, it's a lovely wine. Blending from a vast source of vineyards has given winemaker Cabral the ability to fill in divots of every kind. Gentle and dry, this rich, complex Pinot Noir has the elegance and style you expect from Williams Selyem."
France,85,15,Riesling,white,Dopff & Irion 2007 Riesling (Alsace),"This wine makes you work harder than many of its neighbors to find the flavor but it's worth the effort when you uncover an intriguing mélange of hay, apricot and early summer fruits. The crisp, minerally finish puts one in mind of a platter of choucroute garnie. Drink now to 2013."
US,85,59,Zinfandel,red,Michael David 2009 Gluttony Old Vine Zinfandel Zinfandel (Amador County),"This Amador Zin has Lodi producer Michael David's signature bacon and oak, its 17 months in American oak having no place to hide. The wine's blackberry fruit tastes full, its tannins chewy. High-alcohol California mountain Zin at its most intense concentration."
US,88,19,Merlot,red,San Juan Vineyards 2011 Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills),"All of the fruit for this wine hails from Destiny Ridge Vineyard. Though it saw no new oak, the barrel aromas of vanilla and woodspice seem to jut out. The cranberry and raspberry flavors bring appeal however backed by grainy tannins."
US,88,40,Syrah,red,TruthTeller 2014 The Cynic Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is equal parts Dineen (Yakima) and Patina (Walla Walla) vineyard fruit. Aromas of blue plum, savory herb and peppery spices lead to light elegant flavors that provide enjoyment."
US,91,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Januik 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"This Red Mountain cuvée falls nicely between the winery's Columbia Valley and single-vineyard offerings. Raspberry and cassis fruit, young and compact, is underscored with chalky minerality and suggestions of dried herbs. The tannins are ripe and astringent. This is a spot-on steak wine."
France,89,31,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Vincent Girardin 2011 Les Vieilles Vignes  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"This is a ripe wine, full of apple and apricot fruit with a strong citrus line. A touch of minerality adds tangy texture and gives this rich wine plenty of life and freshness. Drink from 2015."
Italy,86,14,Sangiovese,red,Tenuta Vitalonga 2009 Sangio'vese Sangiovese (Umbria),"This easy expression of Sangiovese offers an unusual set of aromas that spans from sweet Christmas spice to blue flower to green herb. A touch of cola or eucalyptus gives the wine a bright, vertical lift."
France,90,58,Pinot Noir,red,Roche de Bellene 2010 Vieilles Vignes  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),"Savigny-lès-Beaune often shows the softer side of Pinot Noir. This wine has juicy red-cherry and raspberry flavors that balance the gentle, dry tannins. The low-yielding old vines from which the fruit was sourced give this selection extra concentration. This will benefit from medium-term aging."
US,87,35,Red Blend,red,Borra NV Lot 09 47.5 Degree Limited Release Red (Lodi),"Borra is going old-school here, making the wine nonvintage and putting 10% each of Syrah and Mourvedre into Petite Sirah. Smelling of freshly baked bread, the wine is full of structured red fruit, while its tannins are soft and finish is easygoing. A fine bottle for rustic fare."
France,88,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Maison Bouey 2015 Bordeaux By Boyd-Cantenac  (Bordeaux),"A solid wine with firm tannins, this has structure as well as black-currant acidity. It still has a dry core although this will certainly soften over the next few months. It has the potential to be a ripe fruity wine from early 2018."
US,90,66,Chardonnay,white,HdV 2011 Hyde Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),"The mighty partnership between the Hyde and de Villaine families shows maturity in this vineyard-designated wine, from the Hyde's well-respected site. Ripe golden pear delivers a richness to the palate that is offset by floral minerality and a pleasant texture of citrus and spice."
US,89,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Cadence 2010 Coda Red (Red Mountain),"This Coda displays fresh and bright raspberry fruit. The acids come with a crisp snap, and there's an overall juiciness that makes it especially quaffable."
US,94,32,Riesling,white,Trisaetum 2016 Wichmann Dundee Estate Riesling (Dundee Hills),"More tart than sweet, this delicious wine is packed with lemon drop, candied pineapple and tangerine fruit. The acidity is in perfect proportion with the slightly sweet palate, giving it a vivid mouthfeel that extends into the finish and offers versatility for food pairing."
US,92,50,Chardonnay,white,Longoria 2014 Fe Ciega Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"From Rick Longoria's own vineyard comes this high-toned, focused bottling showing Asian pear juice, hot toast and apple blossom on the stonefruit-driven nose. There is steel structure on the sip, which fresh with more fruity pear elements, but also bound to a chipped-slate minerality."
US,88,18,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Zaca Mesa 2006 Z Cuvée Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"A Châteauneuf-style blend, based on Grenache, that's clean, fresh and savory. It shows cherry, currant, anise and herb flavors that are wrapped into a soft texture. Oak adds a pleasant, subtle note of smoke."
US,84,14,Chardonnay,white,Pedroncelli 2012 Signature Selection Chardonnay (Dry Creek Valley),"This is a lush, rich Chardonnay with especially ripe pineapple, peach and lime flavors, as well as a coating of oaky, buttered toast."
France,94,60,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Henri Bourgeois 2014 Jadis  (Sancerre),"This wine is made from parcels on steep slopes and produced as the family's flagship wine. At nearly three years old, it has already mellowed into a richly endowed wine, ripe with green fruits, spice and concentrated acidity. There is so much complexity to this finely structured wine that will allow it to age further. Drink from 2019."
US,93,30,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Merry Edwards 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"The Russian River Valley makes some of the state's greatest Sauvignon Blancs, in the right hands, and when those hands are Merry Edwards', you can be sure of what you're getting. The wine is dry and crisp in mouthwatering acidity, with citrus and lemongrass flavors that have richer tones of tropical fruits. It feels vibrant, elegant and complex in the mouth, a wine to savor over multiple glasses."
France,89,50,Chardonnay,white,Château de Santenay 2013 Clos de la Chaise Dieu  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Beaune),"This is a soft, ripe wine, with juicy acidity to keep it fresh. Flavors of lemon, tangy spice and baked apples are balanced by the taut texture of this still-young wine. Drink from 2017."
France,86,35,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Moillard 2009  Côte de Nuits-Villages,"A fresh wine with red cherry fruits giving a bright character, the tannins soft and with attractive acidity. It is lightly textured and should be ready to drink in 1–2 years."
Italy,94,66,Red Blend,red,Zenato 2011  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"Opening with aromas of crushed violet, ripe plum and black pepper, this is one Amarone that seamlessly combines a hefty structure with finesse. The ripe, savory palate doles out juicy black cherry, blackberry jam, licorice, cake spice and tobacco alongside firm, velvety tannins that lend it a polished texture. Drink 2017–2026."
France,90,45,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Jessiaume 2015 La Comme Premier Cru  (Santenay),"The Domaine, which is based in Santenay, has produced a wine that has structure as well as ripe fruits. The combination promises good aging with the red-plum fruits likely to mellow into a rich concentrated wine. It is a wine to keep and age, and not drink before 2021."
US,87,19,Merlot,red,Dry Creek Vineyard 2006 Merlot (Dry Creek Valley),"Dry and a little bitter in tannins, with flavors of cherries, cranberries and herbs. It's elegantly constructed and feels silky and balanced in the mouth. A very nice and versatile food wine that will take a few years of cellaring."
US,88,29,Pinot Noir,red,Oak Summit 2005 Pinot Noir (Hudson River Region),"Sprays of rose petals and violets mingle decadently with notes of brandy-soaked cherries on this deliciously juicy Pinot Noir. Dry, yet densely concentrated in fruit, its bright acidity carries towards a soft, candy-coated cherry finish."
US,94,49,Pinot Noir,red,Wrath 2011 Boekenoogen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"There's something magical in the dirt of this vineyard, and it shines extra bright in this bottling. The nose combines cranberry and light pomegranate with a fennel funk. Next, the palate starts with a zing of acidity followed by layers of flavor. Red currant and raspberry morph to cola, mocha and dried lavender, then finish on tart cranberry."
US,88,75,Syrah,red,VGS 2012 Syrah (Mount Veeder),"Softly floral and sculpted in red berry and leather, this extracted and somewhat reduced wine may need time in the glass, if not the bottle, to open. The brawnier tendencies reign in full dominance and weight."
Italy,90,55,Red Blend,red,I Balzini 2004 Black Label Red (Colli della Toscana Centrale),"This  blend of Cab, Sangiovese and Merlot has a fruity, almost sweet nose that recalls almond paste or Amaretto, with tones of blueberry and raspberry in the background. It's a fruitier, more immediate wine with pretty renderings of oak and toasted nut in the background. It's also clean and elegant with good staying power."
Italy,86,37,Sangiovese,red,Basile 2011 Ad Agio Riserva  (Montecucco),"Made with 100% Sangiovese, this offers aromas of dark-skinned berry, exotic spice and French oak. The firm palate displays dried red cherry, tobacco and toasted oak but it doesn't have quite enough fruit richness to balance the evident wood sensations."
US,87,85,Pinot Noir,red,Challen 2012 Jasper Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Moderately hollow on the nose, this shows wet slate and damp clay aromas, a bit of a miss for a winery whose recent vintages have been extremely impressive. Pomegranate and raspberry fruit mark the palate, underscored by wet clay earthiness and tangy acidity."
US,91,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Steven Kent 2007 Smith Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"This is a lovely wine to drink now. It's so dry and elegantly constructed, with wonderfully ripe tannins and great integration of oak with the fruit. There's a nice balance of acidity to balance the blackberry, cherry and cola flavors. Drink now, with a brief decant."
US,87,32,Pinot Noir,red,Opolo 2000 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"From a vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands, a young, jammy wine bursting with candied flavors of raspberries and cherries. It drinks very concentrated and intense. There's a caramelly note that may come from well-charred barrels in this dry, full-bodied wine."
US,93,100,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Bacio Divino 2014 Red (Napa Valley),"A Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend from heritage vineyards farmed by Andy Beckstoffer, this wine tastes of chocolate-covered clove, sage and a waft of eucalyptus, thick in concentration and firm, integrated tannin. While it presents itself as a big, bold wine, it retains balance and grace in the glass."
US,92,52,Pinot Noir,red,J. Christopher 2011 Bella Vida Vineyard Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Bella Vida replaces the Abbey Ridge bottling and does so with pizzazz. The best of the 2011 releases, this is a beautiful expression of grapes grown on red clay soils, with refined, deeply penetrating flavors of ripe raspberries. Smooth, supple and long, with uncommon purity, it finishes with a kiss of chocolate from 18 months in one-quarter new oak barrels."
France,86,19,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Pascal Jolivet 2000  Sancerre,"Pungent aromas of field greens and citrus lead into a palate defined by racy lime, grapefruit and passion fruit. The finish is a bit watery, which is a disappointing drop off from the solid citrus flavors present on the front palate. Overall it's a nice wine, nothing more, nothing less."
US,87,22,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Edge 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast),"Made from a blend of 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot and 11% Syrah this herbal Cab divulges peppercorn on the nose as well as cola, leather and cedar. With structured tannins that don't get in the way, it's food-friendly and yet hearty, well-priced for the quality, with a finish of ripe blueberry and raspberry."
US,91,42,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Fallon Place 2014 Nacimento Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Tart and tangy in flavor and soft in texture, this is from a vineyard site high up in the Mayacamas Mountains. Aged in both neutral and new oak, it offers good grip on the palate and nuanced dried-cherry and -cranberry flavors."
Italy,87,18,Red Blend,red,Poggio al Tufo 2015 Rompicollo Red (Toscana),"A blend of 60% Sangiovese and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has aromas of sunbaked earth, dried herb, dark berry and a whiff of underbrush. The soft straightforward palate offers juicy black cherry and a hint of spice framed in easygoing tannins. Drink soon."
US,83,10,Syrah,red,Stonehedge 2000 Syrah (California),"Earthy, herbal aromas veer into cardboard, and a distinct waft of raw green peppercorn. The grapes didn't fully ripen. But the wine is dry, tart and clean and there's a certain food friendliness. Try it with stews or barbecue and you might discover hidden charms. —S.H."
US,89,32,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Silver Mountain 2010 Alloy Red (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Savory pepper, tangy blueberry, black raspberry and pencil-shaving notes show on the nose of this blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Cabernet Franc, 6% Petit Verdot and 4% Merlot. The cedar and graphite element carry to the palate, where tobacco, grapy fruits and dill make for an intriguing sip."
France,87,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Ramafort 2008  Médoc,"At first taste, the tannins dominate. Then fresher fruit shows through. The wine is firmly dry, the texture linear, the fruit showing some black currant character."
US,81,45,Red Blend,red,Sunfire 2003 I Red (Amador County),"Rough and harsh in texture, this is a rustic, tannic blend of Tempranillo and Grenache that has overripe, burnt raisin flavors."
France,90,40,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Château d'Or et de Gueules 2012 Qu'es aQuo Red (Costières de Nîmes),"Something different, the fruit for this wine comes off 80-year-old Carignan vines. The result is an intensely concentrated wine that mixes raspberry and blueberry fruit with delicate herbal shadings. It's full-bodied, but supple and easy to drink, ending on a note of dark chocolate. Drink now–2018."
US,85,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Twisted Cedar 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Lodi),"Aromas like smoke and lemon zest, and sharp citrus flavors make this wine very assertive. It should make a good pairing with fresh-shucked oysters or grilled shrimp."
US,89,18,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Concannon 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Enticing aromas of blackberry, coffee and roasted fennel in a pork au jus mark the nose. The palate shows dark purple fruits, chai spice and cinnamon latte foam."
France,88,75,Chardonnay,white,Joseph Faiveley 2010  Puligny-Montrachet,"This Chardonnay's acidity and minerally structure are finely balanced, and its palate already shows richness. Full, fruity and textured, the wine's touch of toast creeps into notice. This is worth aging for 2–3 years."
US,86,11,Chardonnay,white,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2014 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Pear, butter and spice aromas lead to tingly, broad-feeling flavors that are straight down the fairway."

US,86,18,Red Blend,red,Helwig 2012 Round Up Red Red (California),"Bold, concentrated and spiced with some new oak aromas, this shows opulent fruit flavors. It looks dark, smells ripe, and feels broad textured and full bodied. It is generously proportioned and easy to drink."
US,94,45,Chardonnay,white,Bien Nacido 2014 Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Winemaker Trey Fletcher is creating texturally tantalizing wines that are exciting to sip now but built to last for years in the cellar. This shows lemon blossom, lemon skin, almond and macadamia scents, with a chalky minerality that's evident even on the nose. Racy, laser-focused acidity frames the palate, where lime, grapefruit and apple flavors unfold. Drink now through 2024."
US,85,32,Syrah,red,David Girard 2007 Syrah (El Dorado),"Overtly sweet in cola, chocolate, black cherry purée, glycerine and sandalwood flavors. The sweetness could also be from high alcohol, as the mouthfeel is hot. Drink now."
US,88,22,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Ousterhout 2013 Redwood Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley),"Bristling in acidity and steely in wet stone, this SB is crisp and layered in lemon, with more lemon on the finish. It yearns for shellfish."
US,88,58,Pinot Noir,red,Fess Parker 2006 Clone 115 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"From the former Ashley's Vineyard, which the Parker family sold a few years ago, comes this tough, acidic young wine. It shows a maritime influence in the dry tartness and bitter cherryskin flavors. Could be a sleeper."
US,85,13,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,FlyWine 2013 The Closer Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville),"Innocuous red fruit and a density of baked plum provide a fruity plushness in this travel-size wine, 100% varietal with ample tannin."
US,91,64,Chardonnay,white,Ram's Gate 2012 Ulises Valdez Diablo Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Searingly crisp and yet generous and intense, this Chardonnay from one of grower Ulises Valdez's prime properties is muscular and expansive, rich in apple and honey and a seasoning of mouth-tingling spice. It exemplifies California exuberance. Let it breathe for a while, or age 2020–2025."
US,90,48,Pinot Noir,red,Big Table Farm 2015 Pelos Sandberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Crisply fruity, this shows some carbonic brightness, pushing cranberry and raspberry fruit ahead of lighter flavors of cherry Popsicle. It's a lightweight, yet delightful, summertime red."
France,86,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château le Raz 2002  Montravel,"Generally regarded as one of the lighter vintages of the 21st century, the wine still has charm and attractive mature flavors like mushroom, as well as a leathery texture. The end still hints at freshness and attractive fruit."
Italy,90,60,Sangiovese,red,Avignonesi 2011 Grandi Annate  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"Forest floor, ripe berry and cake spice aromas emerge in the glass. The structured palate doles out dried black cherry, blackberry, licorice, ground pepper and tobacco alongside assertive tannins that need time to unwind. Drink 2017–2021."
US,85,50,Pinot Noir,red,Loring Wine Company 2006 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is the first wine made from Oregon grapes by this southern California winery. But one can't help but wonder if shipping fruit all the way down the coast might bang it up a bit. For whatever reason, this wine tastes fractured, metallic and chalky. There is a core of black cherry, but it seems surrounded by gun-metal flavors, which stick to the palate and abruptly shut down the finish."
France,91,60,Chardonnay,white,Alex Gambal 2013  Meursault,"The mineral texture that marks out a fine Meursault is very present here. Yellow fruits balance with this perfumed and intense wine. Still young and crisp, the acidity gives a tight, nervy edge. The wine obviously needs to age, so drink from 2017."
US,88,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Maddalena 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"A year older than the Riboli family's higher-end San Simeon brand, this bargain bottling is a steal for the oft-ridiculed vintage. Dense elderberry fruit, smoked cedar and dried oregano show on the nose, while the palate is complex and herbacesously Bordelaise in style, with oregano, thyme and dill giving nuance to tart blueberries and black plum fruit."
Italy,87,18,Sangiovese,red,Tenuta di Sesta 2014  Rosso di Montalcino,"Aromas of dried tobacco leaf, toast, oak and underbrush lead the nose. The bright, approachable palate offers black cherry, espresso and star anise alongside fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity."
US,84,11,Red Blend,red,Stephen Vincent 2005 Crimson Red (California),"Rich in cherry, blackberry, raspberry and herb flavors, this Rhône blend has sweet-and-sour berry-cherry flavors. It's rich in dry, furry tannins. Needs something big and meaty to soften it, like beef stew."
France,88,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Leboscq 2014  Médoc,"A ripe, soft and rich wine that will be ready to drink soon. It has black plum and berry fruits, ripe soft tannins and light acidity. The wine has a crisper cooler aftertaste. Drink from 2019."
Italy,93,20,Red Blend,red,Milziade Antano 2012  Montefalco Rosso,"A blend of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino and 15% Merlot, this bold wine conveys earthy aromas of blackberry, leather, tilled soil and a balsamic note. The ripe, creamy palate delivers juicy black plum, cassis, savory herb and baking spice balanced by smooth, velvety tannins. The lingering finish closes on a note of ground black pepper."
US,86,11,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Original House Wine 2014 Steak House Cabernet Sauvignon (America),"This wine is composed of near equal parts Idaho, Washington and California fruit. It starts out a touch reduced, with black currant and sugared-plum aromas. It drinks a hair off dry, which offsets a dry lick of tannins. It's eponymous pairing should work perfectly."
US,93,85,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Pine Ridge 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"So ripe and beautiful in fruit and oak, so balanced in tannins and acids, that it's hard to know whether to enjoy this Cab now or age it. Right now, it's elaborate in blackberry, cherry, currant and new oak flavors, wrapped into insanely fine tannins. But it's also balanced enough to develop bottle complexity over the next 10 years."
US,90,65,Pinot Noir,red,Testarossa 2015 La Rinconada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Buttery vanilla and baked cherry aromas make for a pretty and plump entry to this bottling from a vineyard in the heart of the appellation. Approachable plum and cherry flavors meet baking spice on the palate, the texture soft and acidity ample."
France,89,62,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine A. Machard de Gramont 2011 Clos Blanc Premier Cru  (Pommard),"A structured wine, it has the weight and the firm tannins to give it aging potential. Black cherries, dark fruits and juicy acidity are paired with the drier tannic structure, amking for a smooth and rich wine. Drink from 2016."
France,94,50,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Bouscaut 2014  Pessac-Léognan,"Intense citrus is overlaid by the ripe pineapple and tropical fruit. This delicious complex wine, with its tangy acidity, tightly coiled texture and touches of wood aging, is packed with great fruit. Drink from 2021."
Italy,90,151,Red Blend,red,Le Salette 2010 Pergole Vece Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"Black plum, blue flower, oak, espresso and chocolate aromas waft from the glass of this densely structured wine. The palate delivers blueberry extract, roasted coffee bean, vanilla and spice alonside tightly packed wood tannins that generate an astringent, mouth-drying finish. Give it time to unwind. Drink 2018–2030."
US,90,13,Riesling,white,Red Newt Cellars 2013 Circle Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Lithe and dancing in texture, yet robustly concentrated with yellow peach and cherry flavors, Red Newt's Circle delivers great quality for a gentle price, vintage after vintage. Off dry in style, it's zesty and bright, finishing long with a fresh herbal edge."
US,87,28,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Upland Estates 2009 Julian Red (Snipes Mountain),"This Rhône-style blend of 60% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 20% Mourvèdre is soft and smooth. The fruity, forward palate shows little influence for having aged for 21 months in barrel, and so the flavors tend to be simple. Notes of red berries, red licorice and a dash of cayenne are all found."
US,90,25,Zinfandel,red,Brutocao 2012 Bliss Vineyard Estate Bottled Zinfandel (Mendocino),"A classic Zinfandel with its unmistakable spice aroma and wild berry flavor, this is dry and tannic enough to provide balance. Medium bodied, it packs plenty of flavor and an appetizing mouthfeel."
US,87,25,Red Blend,red,Shed Horn Cellars 2010 Non Typical Red (Lake County),"A robust blend of 38% Zinfandel, 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Petite Sirah, 11% Barbera and 11% Syrah, all grown in Lake County, this rightly named Non Typical red is rich in strawberry and raspberry flavors with dusty overtones. Structured, but soft in the mouth, with a caramel finish."
US,90,38,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Écluse 2014 Rendition Red (Paso Robles),"Damp chaparral, dried blueberry, beef and pencil lead scents show on the nose of this blend of 54% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 11% Mourvèdre. Rounded blueberry and black plum flavors meet loamy soil, anise, thyme and marjoram spice, with a savory touch of smoke."
US,86,25,Chardonnay,white,Hosmer 2010 Limited Release Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Savory apple and spice notes mark this bright wine. Brisk lemon acidity cuts through the full-bodied palate, giving it a refreshing, balanced mouthfeel."
US,88,18,Chardonnay,white,Babcock 1999 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"This is the workhorse release from an always dependable producer, and it's excellent. Not enormously complex or layered, but very ripe; it offers up-front peach flavors veering into tropical fruit, with a solid dose of smoky oak that adds nuance. Vibrant and alive, with high acidity that endows it with marvelous structure."
US,86,12,Merlot,red,Ironstone 2015 Merlot (Lodi),"This wine shows a ton of oak influence, from the smoky charred aromas to the sweet-seeming maple syrup flavors to the velvety clinging texture. It is medium bodied, lush in mouthfeel and high in spice content that dominates the fruit flavors underneath."
US,90,80,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Y Rousseau 2012 Le Roi Soleil Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"Syrupy thick at first, decadent enough for a king, this rich red is defined by vanilla French toast and blackberry jam aromas and flavors. It finds balance midway through on the palate, veering into crisper red tones of cranberry and rhubarb. Time will help mellow things out. Cellar through 2020."
US,90,29,Syrah,red,Coastview 2007 North Block Syrah (Monterey County),"A rich, full-bodied and dry Syrah that shows fine terroir. It comes from an area, in the Gabilan Mountains of Monterey, that does not yet have a sub-appellation, but should. The wine is effusive in blackberries, black currants, mocha, pepper and cedar, with a sweetly exotic note of foie gras. Now–2012."
US,88,30,Chardonnay,white,Januik 2012 Cold Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Offering pleasant, approachable flavors of apple and Asian pear, along with streaks of vanilla and butterscotch, this wine is drinking well and may best be enjoyed while it's fresh and young."
US,93,45,Syrah,red,K Vintners 2009 Cougar Hills Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Broad and earthy, with a dash of funk and a peppery lift, this grips the tongue with authority and power. It's poised and tense, as if balanced on the edge of a precipice, with the fruit, herb, roasted earth and coffee notes all tumbling around in glorious profusion."
US,90,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Jones of Washington 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This well-made, pure Sauvignon Blanc seems to have a noticeable amount of residual sugar—not surprising in a high acid vintage such as 2011. Zesty, lightly grassy, spicy and stylish, it's fresh and rich on the palate, with a finishing streak of minerality."
US,86,18,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Harmony Cellars 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Tastes briary and brambly and peppery, almost like a Zinfandel, with flavors of black currants and cola and a hint of oak. This dry, well-structured and rustic wine will pair well with smoky tri-tip."
US,92,55,Pinot Noir,red,Davies 2012 Spring Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Feral and wild, Spring Hill Vineyard lies in the Petaluma Gap where it is regularly enveloped in fog and cooling coastal winds. The result here is a soft, slightly stemmy, earthy wine with balanced layers of cherry, raspberry and vanilla."
US,87,29,Pinot Noir,red,Raylee 2014 Finnegan Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Forward and bright, with spicy berry fruit, this carries plenty of citrus and a hint of pepper as well. It's done in an easy-going, quaffable style. Give it a slight chill to compensate for the somewhat dull earthy finish."
US,84,25,Pinot Noir,red,Villa Mt. Eden 2005 Bien Nacido Vineyard Grand Reserve Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Other than a sugary sweetness, this wine shows all the hallmarks of a very nice Pinot Noir from this famed vineyard. The raspberry, cherry and vanilla flavors are accented by dusty spices, and the texture is silky. But the wine just doesn't taste dry."
US,89,13,Chardonnay,white,Manifesto! 2013 Chardonnay (North Coast),"The honey and orange aromas, rich texture, full body and late-harvest flavors add up to a bold and fruity wine. With each sip, more complexity and depth comes out, making a lasting impression."
US,93,45,Chardonnay,white,Migration 2010 Split Rail Vineyard Chardonnay (Anderson Valley),"With rich, honeyed flavors of apricots and oranges, this flashy, dramatic Chardonnay seemingly tastes as sweet as a pastry, but the amazing thing is that it's actually dry. It's brisk in coastal acidity, with complex nuances of toasty oak and a creamy mouthfeel. For drinking now."
US,86,66,Pinot Noir,red,Maggy Hawk 2009 Jolie Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This is a good Pinot Noir, although it's a bit off here and there. Dry, crisp and silky, it offers pleasant cherry and cola flavors. But there's just a touch of unripeness that compromises it."
US,86,28,Zinfandel,red,Wilson 2011 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Dark in color, this soft, leathery Zin offers tangents of blackberry, chocolate and espresso within a heavy-handed package of serious fruit and weight."
US,85,38,Chardonnay,white,One Woman 2010 Estate Reserve Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),"Crème caramel and spice aromas are exotically appealing on this bright, full-bodied Chardonnay. Dry in style with zesty acidity and fresh apple flavor, the palate is a bit more subtle than the nose, but makes this a straightforward drinker."
France,84,10,Chardonnay,white,Phantom Bay 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Vin de France),"Oaky notes of buttered toast, dried apple slices and baked peach are upfront in the bouquet of this wine. The palate is similarly rich and round, but with ample acidity to keep it from falling completely flat. Flavors of orange creamsicle and spiced apple linger on the close."
US,87,39,Chardonnay,white,Venge 2009 Maldonado Vineyard Dijon Clones Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Loads of pineapple jam and roasted peach flavors in this rich, oaky Chardonnay. Nothing shy about its fruity power, with rich vanilla and caramel oak barrel influences. Could use greater complexity and nuance."
France,89,37,Chardonnay,white,Collovray et Terrier 2008 Domaine des Deux Roches Les Cras  (Saint-Véran),"Soft in character and rounded, this is a full-bodied wine, feeling fat and gently textured. The yellow fruits are sweet, ripe, buoyed by wood and finishing with attractive acidity."
US,84,14,Riesling,white,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2008 Dry Riesling (Willamette Valley),"Dry indeed; this is so dry as to be outright sour. It's an acid-lover's dream wine; but be prepared to pucker up. It's a mouthful of lemon juice, some cardboardy phenolics, and very tart green apples."
US,94,60,Pinot Noir,red,MacPhail 2007 Ferrington Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"MacPhail continues its string of super 2007 vineyard-designated Pinots with this compact, fine young release. It's a bit tight now in acids and tannins, but shows a warm, sweet heart of cherries, raspberries and cola that should emerge with a few years in the cellar. Just beautiful."
US,92,55,Pinot Noir,red,Antonio Patric 2009 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This has brisk acidity, finely ground tannins and an intense minerality that gives it a nervy core. The palate is light and silky, yet it has intensely concentrated flavors of sour cherry candy, raspberry jam and sandalwood. It's a fine wine to drink now, and it should develop in the bottle over the next 5–6 years."
Italy,85,18,Sangiovese,red,La Colombina 2014  Rosso di Montalcino,"This has a nose of mint, blue flower and berry while the simple diluted palate offers hints of fresh strawberry and white pepper. It's easy drinking, with bright acidity and frail tannins."
France,91,14,White Blend,white,Domaine Bott-Geyl 2014 Métiss White (Alsace),"A gently floral nose gives rise to a charming and soft palate. Fresh pear buried in mounds of white petals on the nose leads to a distinct, ultraclean and dry palate. Despite its alluring, aromatic softness it has complete focus. The finish offers pure lemon."
US,85,19,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),"With layers of coffee, spice and cedar enveloping scents of ripe black fruit and bramble, Hazlitt's Cab is beautifully composed on the nose. It's lean in style and body, however, with a black plum palate marked by whiffs of sweet tomato and green leaves on the finish."
US,88,20,Zinfandel,red,Kenwood 2005 Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Higher in alcohol than Kenwood's regular '05 Sonoma Zin, this one's hotter and more full-bodied. It's got a density that can stand a little bottle age. Give it two or three years to soften, and let the blackberry, cherry and coffee fruit emerge from the tannins."
US,87,46,Syrah,red,Sonkin Cellars 2012 Unmasked Syrah (Yorkville Highlands),"Bold tannins and firm acidity make this wine a bit stiff to enjoy now, but it should benefit from aging through 2020. Aromas are lightly earthy, while flavors reflect cranberry and tart cherry. The texture carries a tooth-coating layer of tannins."
France,94,193,Chardonnay,white,Olivier Leflaive 2014 Les Pucelles Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),"Situated next door to the Grand Cru vineyards, this vineyard produces some grand wines. This wine comes from the Olivier Leflaive domaine. It has richness and concentration with beautifully dense yellow fruits that are cut with inspiring acidity. The texture shows minerality and a taut and nervy character that will allow this fine wine to age very well. Drink from 2020."
France,91,55,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Laroque 2005  Saint-Émilion,"Now developing into an impressive, maturing wine, this is rich and complex. It has well integrated tannins that bring out sweet acidity, spice and finely lightly roasted coffee. Ready to drink, it should certainly keep for at least six years and probably more."
US,92,55,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Tudal 2008 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A distinguished Cabernet whose superb tannins, which are firm and ripe and refined, testify to its Napa origins. So does the blackberry and currant fruit, which finishes in a swirl of sweet, smoky cedar wood. Good as it is, it's way too young. Should be best around 2015 and afterward."
US,86,29,Chardonnay,white,Frostwatch 2005 Chardonnay (Bennett Valley),"Lots to like in this dry, fruity Chardonnay. It has flavors of tropical fruits, buttered toast and caramel, wrapped into a rich, creamy mouthfeel. But it's pretty acidic, if you're sensitive to prickliness in your wines."
US,81,24,Red Blend,red,Minassian-Young 2009 Junipero Red (Paso Robles),"Marred by a vegetal taste, this has hot, thin cherry and oak flavors. The blend is Mourvèdre, Zinfandel and Grenache."
Italy,87,16,Sangiovese,red,Tamburini 2008 Il Massiccio Sangiovese (Toscana),"Il Massiccio is 85% Sangiovese with Merlot and Alicante, opening with bright cherry and raspberry aromas, with sour acidity and a touch of almond. Pair it with pepperoni or sausage pizza."
Italy,90,60,Sangiovese,red,La Fiorita 2011  Brunello di Montalcino,"Tilled earth, ripe dark-skinned berry, leather and menthol aromas show this wine's Sangiovese pedigree. The robust, concentrated palate doles out crushed black cherry, raspberry jam, cinnamon, licorice and the warmth of evident alcohol—the latter a common characteristic of this hot vintage. Firm, ripe tannins provide the framework. Drink 2017–2021."
France,96,400,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Trotanoy 2009  Pomerol,"Beneath the surface tannins is great Merlot fruit, very ripe and full-bodied, a powerhouse of flavors. The depth and complexity of the wine is all there, along with a dark core of dryness. A wine for long-term aging."
US,94,175,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Janzen 2010 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Enormously rich and complex, with blackberry and currant flavors accompanied by notes of green olives and new oak. The tannins are thick, but ripe. Way too young to drink now due to the closed-down astringency, the wine practically begs to be cellared. Give it 6–10 years."
Italy,87,22,Sangiovese,red,Piccini 2005 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"This Riserva is measured in terms of its aromatic intensity and although it does deliver cherry, spice and warm notes of leather and almond, it does so in a very understated manner. The more you get to know it in the glass, the more you can identify delicate floral and ethereal aromas that point to a traditional Chianti Classico style. Sharp acidity and bright fruit flavors tell the same story in the mouth."
France,93,45,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Prieuré St. Jean de Bébian 2008 Red (Coteaux du Languedoc),"Open and primal on nose, this has notes of game, roasted meat, lead pencil, green bell pepper and blackberry. It offers succulent fruit on the midpalate, accompanied by generous viscosity and oak. The wine sits broadly across the palate with significant heft, chewy tannins and moderate acidity. The harmony of flavors and structure lingers onto the lengthy finish."
US,90,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Windsor Oaks 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Chalk Hill),"No need to cellar this Cab. It's so rich and ripe, it's easy to drink now despite some firm tannins. Showy and flashy, it has raspberry, cherry and blueberry flavors, with a jacket of smoky oak. Nevertheless, it will take 5–6 years of aging."
US,92,28,Riesling,white,Trisaetum 2015 Wichmann Dundee Riesling (Dundee Hills),"Among the four Rieslings designated as off dry, this shows the most sweetness on the palate, with a slightly granular mouthfeel, like crystallized cane sugar. It accents the round fruit flavors of Meyer lemon and satsuma orange, which overflow the midpalate and run into a lingering finish with a touch of orange pekoe tea."
US,86,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Lyeth 2011 Chronology Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Dried cherry and cranberry combine on the palate around a trunk of smoky oak, offering a dry, black-peppery sensation. With 13% Malbec, it has a suggestion of blueberry going on as well, before a mid-length finish."
US,85,19,Riesling,white,Barnstormer 2014 Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake),"Lean and sheen, this light-footed dry Riesling is a showcase of minerality over fruit. It's demure in concentration but refreshing, finishing brisk and clean."
US,86,12,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Original House Wine 2016 Fish House Sauvignon Blanc (America),"The aromas are quite light, with notes of tropical fruit, white grapefruit and sweet herb. The flavors are similarly light and sleek, offering a nip of acid on the finish."
US,91,76,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Garavin 2012 Linked Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Knights Valley),"Rich aromas of meaty charcuterie provide a compelling reason to investigate this wine further, a largely varietal undertaking with 5% Merlot, aged two years in 80% new French oak. Chalky, dusty tannins add a smokiness and medium weight, before finishing with a touch of dried herb."
US,90,19,Zinfandel,red,Sausal 2009 Family Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"It's classic Alexander Valley, soft, rich and thick in melted tannins, and elaborate in tiers of briary wild berries, milk chocolate, black pepper and sweet charred oak. Easy to drink with everything from burgers and steaks to tacos and teriaki beef."
France,86,10,White Blend,white,Domaine de Ménard 2015 White (Côtes de Gascogne),"Attractively aromatic, this is a crisp blend of Colombard and Sauvignon Blanc from the same area as many of the Armagnac vineyards. It is fruity with a zesty lemon texture and so light and perfumed. It is ready to drink now."
US,88,40,Pinot Noir,red,Moshin 2012 Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"High in perceptible acidity, this wine leans savory in rhubarb, cranberry and a twist of sour cherry, adding in clove and black pepper behind the scenes. Light-bodied, it's soft and table-ready."
US,91,60,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Cadence 2012 Camerata Cara Mia Vineyard Red (Red Mountain),"At a full 91% of the blend, this could be labeled as Cabernet Sauvignon, with Cabernet Franc rounding it out. It's shut down aromatically at present with assorted dried herbs poking through. The palate brings highly structured fruit flavors, with vibrant acidity tying it all together. Decant for a day if drinking in the near term; it will be best after 2022."
US,90,19,Zinfandel,red,Klinker Brick 2014 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"This wine is rich, ripe, concentrated and almost sweet. It's wonderful to smell the raspberry syrup aromas, taste the blueberry and blackberry flavors and feel the creaminess of the texture coating the palate. Low in tannins but high in viscosity, it's a pleasure to sip."
US,89,25,Red Blend,red,Atrea 2012 Old Soul Red (Mendocino County),"This dry wine tastes ripe and jammy but not plodding, full of blackberry and boysenberry flavors. It feels smooth but not soft, having enough tannins to support the richness. Dark chocolate flavors develop on the second and third sips and the texture turns even more soothing. It's made with Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Malbec and Syrah."
US,88,28,Chardonnay,white,Rutherford Hill 2013 Limited Release Chardonnay (Carneros-Napa Valley),Sour apple and fennel characterize this wine upon entry. These follow through on the nose and palate around a concentrated core of golden honey and lemony acidity.
US,93,20,Chardonnay,white,Mount Eden Vineyards 2012 Wolff Vineyard Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"Buttered toast, oaky smoke and a slight mango tropicality converge for an epic nose on this Chardonnay from a vineyard that was planted in 1976. There are layers of flavor too, lime citrus at first evolving toward brioche with a butterscotch finish, and some salt and cracked pepper throughout."
France,89,35,Pinot Noir,red,Maison Stéphane Brocard 2014 Closerie des Alisiers Vieilles Vignes  (Marsannay),"Stéphane Brocard is based in Marsannay the northernmost vineyard in Burgundy's Côte d'Or. This wine comes from two small parcels with 35-year-old vines. It is already fruity and attractive, although the tannins do promise aging. Crisp with the pure acidity of the vintage, it will develop well and should be drunk from late 2017."
US,81,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Martin Ranch 2008 J.D. Hurley Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This tastes like Port, with raisin, prune and chocolate flavors. Drink up."
US,86,55,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Lorenzi Estate 2012 Brutus Red (Temecula Valley),"A tarry, asphalt character shows on this bottling of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, as well as oregano and dark but slightly sour berries. The palate offers charred cherries and charcoal notes, yet the mouthfeel and structure are relatively light."
US,82,11,Chardonnay,white,Nickname 2011 Chardonnay (California),"Pretty standard Chardonnay. Shows the wine's cream, buttered toast and fruit flavors, but in a thin, simple way."
US,89,135,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Janzen 2006 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Very dense, very rich, and really too thick in primary fruit flavors to enjoy now. Almost like a blackberry, cassis and chocolate-filled pastry, with the oaky overlay playing the role of sweet, smoky crust, and the alcohol providing heat. Soft, too. Not particularly elegant now, but might age, if you want to roll the dice on this pricey 100% Cab."
Italy,84,10,Pinot Grigio,white,My Moon 2011 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie),Here's a steady value wine from Northern Italy that shows easy aromas of citrus and melon backed by fresh acidity and a lively mouthfeel. Pair this wine with raw mozzarella drizzled with olive oil.
US,88,92,Chardonnay,white,Alpha Omega 2010 Reserve Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"New oak takes center stage in this Chardonnay with buttered toast aromas and intense caramel and butterscotch flavors that dominate the underlying orange and mango. It's a soft, creamy wine, that's rich and exotic. Drink now."
Italy,89,30,Red Blend,red,Pratesi 2013 Il Circo Rosso Riserva  (Carmignano),"Made of 70% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot, this offers black currant and vanilla aromas. The dense, approachable palate delivers ripe black plum and toasty tobacco flavors, pulled taut by firm tannins. Drink through 2019."
France,92,32,Chardonnay,white,Jean-Marc Brocard 2015 Vau de Vey Premier Cru  (Chablis),"This premier cru is on the cooler left bank of the Serein river, making this vintage a crisply mineral wine that's tight with zesty lemon and fine crisp acidity. The hints of yellow fruits are still to develop. The wine is structured and needs to age, so drink from 2018."
US,86,16,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Trump 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Monticello),"This bottling resembles the New Zealand paradigm of Sauvignon Blanc, bearing aromas of grapefruit, passion fruit and kiwi; a sprinkling of graham cracker adds interest. The wine hits the palate like a fleshy fist, with an intense, grassy gooseberry flavor that provides plenty of punch. Pair with apricot-glazed roasted chicken."
France,88,21,Chardonnay,white,Joseph Drouhin 2014  Saint-Véran,This unoaked wine made from low-yield vines has great minerality and a tight texture. It is packed with acidity as well as citrus fruits. The mineral edge gives the wine tightness and also brings out apples and tangy acidity. Drink from 2017.
US,91,29,Zinfandel,red,Two Vintners 2012 StoneTree Vineyard Zinfandel (Wahluke Slope),"It's hard to ignore the high alcohol listing, but the wine is so well balanced and cohesive that few would even notice. It's aromatic with notes of dried and fresh cranberries and raspberries. The palate is full bodied and rich with concentrated, pure fruit flavors."
US,91,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Occasio 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"This wine is agile and elegant, very firm in texture without being too full-bodied. It smells lightly smoky, slightly herbal and tastes moderately rich as subtle plum and pomegranate flavors transition to richer berry and cocoa notes on the finish. It needs time to show more complexity, so drink after 2020."
France,90,28,Chardonnay,white,Jean Manciat 2008 Vieilles Vignes  (Mâcon-Charnay),"Well-balanced wine, ripe fruit, touches of wood, light spice, ginger and sweet apples. Structured, held well together by wood."
US,93,65,Pinot Noir,red,Three Sticks 2011 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Round and rich, this wine takes on renewed complexity in the glass. Seductive in earthy red and black berry fruit and exotic spice, it offers naturally realized structure in a stylized package that should remain interesting for years."
US,86,14,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Murphy-Goode 2014 The Fumé Sauvignon Blanc (North Coast),"This clean and relatively crisp wine has mild fruit-salad flavors and lively acidity. It's medium-bodied, not too assertive and should please a crowd."
France,89,18,Chardonnay,white,Jean-Marc Brocard 2010 Kimmeridgien  (Bourgogne),"Just an edge of butter gives this wine roundness and extra richness. Along with this character comes ripe peach fruit, lifted with acidity. Ready to drink. Screwcap."
US,90,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Vellum 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Lots of characteristic Cabernet flavor in this wine. Blackberrry jam and cassis liqueur flavors flood the mouth, heady and flashy and long in the finish. The tannins are thick, yet so soft, you can enjoy this wine now, although it will develop over the next ten years."
US,87,27,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Duckhorn 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Soft and delicious, if a little one-dimensional. No denying the lushness of the pineapple, orange and golden apricot fruit flavors, or the pretty spices. Sémillon adds a cashew nut oiliness. Could use greater dryness and acidity."
US,92,25,Merlot,red,San Simeon 2011 Estate Reserve Merlot (Paso Robles),"Dense and luxurious aromas of oak-laden red currants, blueberry, peppercorns and melted dark chocolate greet the nose on this hearty bottling. The flavors are lighter than the nose suggests, yet the silky texture evolves quickly to deliver plenty of espresso bean, vanilla, blueberry and blackberry elements, all clinging to a strong tannic structure."
US,82,16,Sangiovese,red,Mount Baker Vineyards 2006 Barrel Select Sangiovese (Yakima Valley),"Very light, could almost be a rosé."
US,92,39,Chardonnay,white,Dolin 2013 Estate Chardonnay (Malibu Coast),"Now officially labeled from the newly named Malibu Coast appellation, this bottling shows lots of potential for the region. Aromas of lush lemonade, crushed vanilla, browned butter, honeysuckle and honey lead into a soft and lush palate that's buttery but high-toned. Flavors of toasted bread with orange marmalade prove warm but tartly dynamic."
US,92,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Robert Mondavi 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"A big, dense, brooding wine, concentrated and powerful in blackberries, cherries and cassis. The tannins are sandpapery, giving the mouth a scoury feeling added to by the acids. An interesting, complex young wine that's well made and needs time to come around. Drink it over the next 6–8 years."
US,88,15,Riesling,white,Chateau Lafayette Reneau 2013 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"A veritable harvest of sun-kissed peaches and melons, this is an unabashedly forward, fruity dry-style Riesling. Juicy and ripe with soft streaks of acidity, it should be enjoyed now for it's youthful glory."
US,85,24,Red Blend,red,Pietra Santa 2011 Sassolino Red (Cienega Valley),"This Super Tuscan-like blend of 81% Sangiovese and 19% Cabernet Sauvignon, whose name refers to the little stones on the estate, shows reductive aromas of black olive, rubber and dried pressed purple flowers. Flavors range from mushroom to slate, but the tannins need mellowing and it could use a little more air altogether."
France,85,21,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Fleur la Forge 2012 Réserve  (Bordeaux),"Firm and structured, this wine has strong wood-aging spice and ripe tannins. The fruit is suppressed by the toasty wood flavors, but it holds hints of black currant fruitiness for the future. Drink from 2015."
US,86,16,Chardonnay,white,Silver Thread 2012 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"A wisp of smoke lends nuance to aromas of apple and white peach on this dry, refreshingly citric Chardonnay. The palate builds in bulk and body with concentrated flavors of savory apples layered in smoke and earth. Drink now."
US,87,20,Syrah,red,Domaine Berrien 2010 Syrah (Lake Michigan Shore),"Dark, compelling notes of espresso bean and incense, charred herb and bread hit the nose first. The palate feels full and round, and it possesses stimulating acids that give lift."
US,94,95,Pinot Noir,red,Hanzell 2008 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Valley),"With Pinot Noir, the magic trick is to have it taste sweet and ripe, and yet to finish bone dry. Few wineries in California accomplish this as regularly as Hanzell, and here they come again, with this wonderful 2008. It's entirely consistent with their past history, being dry, a little tannic and tantalizingly rich in cherry, raspberry and cola fruit. Enjoyable now, with decanting, and should develop in the cellar over the next dozen years if not longer, based on the winery's track record."
US,84,40,Merlot,red,Bargetto 2006 Reserve Merlot (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Tastes a bit sweet and jammy in sour cherry candy flavors, with high acidity giving it some sting. Doesn't seem likely to improve, so drink now."
France,88,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Mission Saint Vincent 2014  Bordeaux,"The wine has fine potential. While the wood flavors are dominant, as it develops the ripe red-berry flavors that are there will fill out and bring their fruity acidity along. It is going to be ready to drink from 2017."
US,90,35,Pinot Noir,red,Lucas & Lewellen 2015 Estate Vineyards Goodchild High 9 Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Bright red-fruit tones of hibiscus and pomegranate meet with dried fennel on the complex nose of this bottling from the winery owned by pioneering vintner Louis Lucas and his friend, Judge Royce Lewellen. It's light bodied, but with a grippy texture, showing candied rose petal, thyme and roasted red-fruit flavors."
US,84,12,Merlot,red,Wild Meadows 2012 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"An enjoyable easy drinker with notes of bell pepper and sugared plum. It's broad in feel, lightly sweet with abundant plum flavors."
US,90,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Novelty Hill 2015 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This leads with vibrant and fresh aromas, recalling cut grass, herbs, lime zest and citrus, with whiffs of tropical fruit. The palate brings tart, zingy, mouthwatering citrus flavors, with a lightly creamy feel on the finish."
Italy,91,70,Sangiovese,red,Uccelliera 2010  Brunello di Montalcino,"Hearty and soulful, this offers aromas of tilled soil, leather, game and woodland berry. The meaty palate is still very tightly wound, delivering black cherry, plum, grilled sage, licorice and tobacco alongside bold tannins. Hold until 2018 then enjoy."
US,94,33,Syrah,red,Novy 2006 Rosella's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This dramatic and stunningly rich Syrah shows depth, power and ripely smooth, finely ground tannins that make it drinkable now. Black currants, licorice, mocha, violets, mushu plum sauce, black pepper and Provençal herbs fascinate as the wine changes in the glass. Drink now through 2010."
Italy,87,15,White Blend,white,Blason 2006 Venc White (Friuli Isonzo),"This blend of Friulano and Pinot Bianco from Friuli in northeastern Italy offers a nice balance of elements. The wine is fragrant and floral with jasmine, honey and almond yet the texture is creamy and thick. You get both power and elegance here."
US,94,50,Pinot Noir,red,Boekenoogen 2011 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Blending distinction with sheer pleasure, the bouquet opens with scents of green, black, and Kalamata olives, sage, forest floor and slate. Those aromas translate remarkably to the palate, which is a potpourri of dried herbs and wet earth. There are barely any overt fruit characteristics, and the savory, sophisticated result is simply delicious."
US,87,20,Merlot,red,Rancho Sisquoc 2009 Flood Family Vineyards Merlot (Santa Barbara County),"This is arguably the winery's best Merlot ever. While it is not an ager, it is a lovely food wine that's dry, with crisp acidity. It expresses subtle flavors of cherry, red currant, tobacco and sandalwood flavors."
US,93,50,Chardonnay,white,Lutum 2015 Gap's Crown Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"A shy, floral nose subtly emanates from the glass in this lightly built, elegant expression from the spectacular vineyard in the Petaluma Gap. Anise, sea salt and preserved lemon flavors form its foundation; subtle oak and tense acidity provide support."
US,91,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Diamond Terrace 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"This young, brash Cabernet is filled with adolescent power and angst. It's all sinew and potency now, in the grip of strong, masculine tannins that overshadow the blackberry fruit. It's clearly a cellar candidate, and should emerge, in eight years or so, with authority."
US,91,60,Pinot Noir,red,Elk Cove 2015 Mount Richmond Pinot Noir,"This wine's cranberry, raspberry and cherry flavors are spicy and tart, carrying a suggestion of hard candy. It's consistent throught its tart finish and promises much development ahead. Drink now through the late 2020s."
US,88,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Martin Ray 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This manages to combine instant drinkability with Napa complexity, resulting in a really nice wine. Although it's not an ager, it rises to the occasion with sweetly ripe raspberries, cherries and blackberries, plush, polished tannins and a lovely coating of smoky oak."
US,95,105,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Mirror 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"This is a gentle giant of a wine, so packed with flavor and drenched with ripe tannins that it literally coats the palate. Clove, cedar and blackberry fill the aroma, while dark chocolate, spiced cherries and blackberries flood the flavors. While full bodied and richly tannic, it maintains fabulous balance, and is destined for a long life in the cellar. Best from 2024–2035."
US,93,125,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Janzen 2014 Beckstoffer Missouri Hopper Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Soft supple tannins open a gateway of big bold respectable power and flavor in this vineyard designate from the famous Napa Valley grower. Black pepper, mountain-like sage, milk chocolate, cedar and pencil shavings all rise to the fore of this impressive, complex, interwoven wine that should do well in the cellar and be enjoyable now."
US,95,325,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hall 2012 Rainin Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"This is a sultry, sexy wine—elegant in red fruit and black licorice, with a restrained approach to both tannin and oak. From a mountain vineyard, this has a complex mix of aromas, from pine and forest floor to brambly wild berry. Full bodied and voluptuous on the palate, it remains balanced and pretty. It's a wine that can be enjoyed now, but will age well through 2022."
US,86,14,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Boeger 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (El Dorado),"This is a rich, full-bodied wine in a generally light and crisp field. It has the heft and texture of more substantial varietals—and indeed has Sémillon, Flora and Chardonnay blended in. It also offers a touch of sweetness and straightforward apple and Anjou pear flavors."
France,87,22,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Barton & Guestier 2013 Passeport  (Sancerre),"This is full, ripe and strongly mineral. Its young apricot and citrus fruits are very fresh, bright and have a sense of structure with minerality and zesty, tangy lemon peel. With its good depth of flavor, it is ready to drink."
US,91,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Kendall-Jackson 2006 Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"The vintage was a good one for all K-J's Cabernets, and this Grand Reserve offers lots of bang for your buck. It's full-bodied and dry, with rich blackberry jam, red currant, licorice and cedar flavors that finish long and spicy."
Italy,87,15,Pinot Grigio,white,Pighin 2011 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Grave),"Great for easy seafood or pasta dishes, this is fresh, with crisp acidity backed by notes of stone fruit, melon and yellow rose."
US,89,59,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Kasuari 2010 Parady Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A big Cabernet, showing the dramatic mouthfeel that well-made Napa Cabernet always has. It's full bodied, dry and softly tannic, with classic blackberry and currant flavors. Should hold in the bottle for about six years."
Italy,90,31,Pinot Grigio,white,Tramin 2010 Unterebner Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),"Pinot Grigio Unterebner offers a beautiful contrast between cool-climate aromas of white flower and passion fruit and spicy, oak-driven aromas of vanilla and cinnamon bun. Pair this wine with a savory appetizer strudel filled with spinach, cheese and pine nuts."
Italy,93,90,Red Blend,red,Giovanni Chiappini 2010 Guado de' Gemoli  (Bolgheri Superiore),"plush wine, it's made from 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Merlot. It starts off with aromas of black berries, plum and stewed prunes along with a whiff of cedar. The warm, low-acid palate delivers mature black cherry, black currants, tobacco and black pepper alongside big, ripe tannins and the warmth of the noticeable alcohol. Drink through 2020. Lyra Wine, The Shepherd Company."
US,88,36,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Love That Red 2014 Daily Double Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Cabernet Franc makes up half this wine, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon (33%) and Merlot. Plum, blueberry, blackberry and baking-spice aromas lead to a fruit-filled palate with light barrel accents throughout."
US,91,55,Pinot Noir,red,Small Vines 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Feral and smoky, this light-bodied, light-colored estate-farmed wine gives way to dark cherry, white pepper and pronounced floral elements of rose and violet. Given time in 35% new French oak, it's structured and intriguing, with a tannic punch on the finish."
US,93,95,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Sojourn 2009 Vineyard Georges III Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"This will impress red wine lovers with its sheer deliciousness. It offers waves of blackberry and blueberry jam, dark chocolate, anise and cedar wood flavors, leading to a long, spicy finish. It's a bit soft, which might limit ageability, but it is a lovely wine to drink over the next few years."
US,91,55,Pinot Noir,red,Aiken 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),"Waxy cherry and pomegranate invite the senses before a taste of dried cranberry wafts in, layering itself on top of velvety, silky tannins. Juicy and well-composed, it hails from an appellation not known for the variety. In the hands of this producer, also a fine craftsman of Cabernet, this wine simply sings."
US,87,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Medlock Ames 2013 Bell Mountain Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Wild aromas of sage, thyme and cedar play out on the aromatic entry of this softly layered wine. Integrated oak wraps around a density of chocolate and herb, before the full-bodied finish mellows out."
France,91,14,Red Blend,red,Domaine des Terrisses 2012 Grande Tradition Red (Gaillac),"This is a broad, rich blend of Duras and Braucol with a little Syrah thrown in. It is ripe, with black fruits and balanced tannins that give structure but do not dominate. A smoky character from wood aging rounds it out. Drink from 2016."
US,88,34,Pinot Noir,red,Boedecker Cellars 2008 Stewart Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Pretty scents show pure varietal character, with the accent on fresh berries and sweet herb. Flavors follow suit, with well-managed, ripe and smooth tannins. A medium-bodied wine drinking well right now."
US,88,42,Zinfandel,red,Vermeil 2010 Luvisi Vineyard Zinfandel (Calistoga),"Gigantic, huge, enormously extracted Zinfandel. So strong, it's practically a food group. Offers tiers of raspberries, cherries, blackberries, black currants, raisins, dark chocolate and spices. The alcohol level is very high, giving it a hot finish. It's a classic example of this old vine, superripe style."
Italy,87,14,Red Blend,red,Godiolo 2006 Riserva  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"Aromas of spiced plum, coffee, leather and underbrush come together in the glass. The mature palate offers dried black cherry, tar, graphite, smoke and tobacco alongside dry tannins that leave an astringent finish."
US,90,80,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Lobo 2013 Wulff Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),"Blended with smaller amounts of Merlot and Petit Verdot, this mighty wine offers a depth and concentration of berry pie, chocolate and vanilla within a moderately structured amount of acidity.

US,88,60,Zinfandel,red,Beekeeper Cellars 2015 Monticello Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Smoky char, dried herb, cedar and cherry with plum adorn this full-figured concentrated wine, which shows a touch of heat on the palate. From a site at 1,500-feet in elevation, and blended with 5% Petite Sirah, it mellows well in the glass."
US,87,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Lake Sonoma 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Lots of smooth tannins and succulent raspberry, cherry, cocoa and cedar flavors in this dry Cabernet. It's a bit sharp, but will pair nicely with steaks and chops, and the price isn't bad."
US,93,40,Pinot Noir,red,Comartin 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"There's lovely vibrancy to the nose of this bottling, with tangy cranberry, hibiscus and strawberry aromas, yet those are deftly cut by peppercorns, brown spice and turned earth. The mouthfeel is engagingly peppery, with spicy bay leaf and thyme herbs, a touch of cured Kalamata olives and an underlying, underripe raspberry and cranberry fruit base."

France,88,40,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Huguenot 2014 La Créole  (Côte de Nuits-Villages),"There is an attractive, smoky touch of wood in this perfumed wine.

US,90,35,Pinot Noir,red,Landmark 2014 Grand Detour Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Shy and reserved on the nose, this wine is invitingly smooth and velvety in texture, with an intensity at its core.

US,86,39,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Prime 2005 District 4 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This inaugural release is pretty good, made in the international or cult style of softness, extreme ripeness and early palate appeal. It's forward in jammy cherry, black currant and plum flavors."
US,88,14,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Firestone 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"Touches of tangerine decorate a brisk nose that's also redolent with mineral elements of chalk and wet river stone.

Complex and elegant, especially in its floral perfume, it drinks voluptuously, full of come-hither ripeness."
US,94,56,Chardonnay,white,Bethel Heights 2015 Justice Vineyard Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills),"Almost decadently rich, this seduces with aromas of toasted hazelnuts, buttery stone fruits and sweet sliced pineapple. In perfect balance and drinking beautifully, it should remain at its peak through the mid-2020s."
US,87,15,Chardonnay,white,Husch 2006 Chardonnay (Mendocino),"It's all about acidity and long hangtime with this Chard. The acids come from chilly, foggy nights, the ripeness from long, warm, sunny days. What you get is oodles of bright, pure pineapple, Granny Smith apple, Meyer lemon and spicy clove flavor, with a touch of caramelized oak for richness."
US,91,45,Pinot Noir,red,Carlton Hill 2010 Pinot Noir,"Spicy, with a hint of mint, this deftly integrated, late-release wine brings rhubarb and raspberry fruit into place.

US,90,48,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Venteux 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"This Cab is soft and lush with cherry, red currant and anise flavors that linger long into a spicy finish. It gains extra points for the tannin-acid structure, which is so easy to like."

US,89,30,Pinot Noir,red,Millbrook 2010 Proprietor's Special Reserve Pinot Noir (New York),"While sultry and rich with ripe black-fruit flavors, this concentrated Pinot Noir is surprisingly multidimensional on the nose and palate.

US,92,38,Merlot,red,Reininger 2008 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Although this is currently aggressively oaky, this full, fleshy Merlot is on the path to excellence. Bright berry and plum flavors are kissed with notes of vanilla, cinnamon and toast, plus a hint of herb."
US,90,28,Merlot,red,Whitehall Lane 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Pretty nice Merlot, soft and sensual, like Merlot is supposed to be, and wonderfully ripe in blackberry, cherry, blueberry, plum, chocolate, cedar, vanilla and spice flavors. A pretty complex wine that finishes long and smooth. Drink now."
US,87,58,Pinot Noir,red,Frank Family 2011 Lewis Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This ripe Pinot is as sweetly sappy as raspberry syrup. The oak brings additional sweetness, this time of caramel and buttered toast. A little clumsy now, but might gain traction in the cellar."

France,88,40,Pinot Noir,red,Domaines Devillard 2011 Domaine de la Ferté Premier Cru Servoisine  (Givry),"Very dark, structured wine, with coffee as well as fruit flavors.

US,85,13,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Lone Birch 2013 Red (Yakima Valley),"This blend holds Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Aromas of fresh herbs, jalapeño peppers and cherries lead to medium-bodied cherry and raspberry flavors backed by soft tannins."
Italy,91,17,White Blend,white,Pieropan 2013  Soave Classico,"Fragrances recall honeysuckle, jasmine and citrus zest. The juicy palate offers creamy green apple, Bartlett pear and nectarine alongside zesty acidity. A note of white almond signals the close."
US,85,15,Chardonnay,white,North by Northwest 2015 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Subdued aromas of melon and apple lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors. It comes off as a bit generic, with the variety seeming to get lost."
France,88,17,White Blend,white,L'Enclos des Braves 2016 Les Gourmands Blanc White (Gaillac),"Blending Loin de l'Oeil and Sauvignon Blanc, this perfumed, smooth and spicy wine is immediately arresting.

US,87,18,Riesling,white,Silver Thread 2012 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"The faintest waft of marshmallow lends a pleasantly confectionery note to stone-fruit and blossom aromas on this dry, medium-bodied Riesling. The palate is elegant with brisk herbal tones and zesty lime acidity."
US,94,65,Chardonnay,white,Walt 2014 Bob's Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Bob's is the producer's estate vineyard, acquired in 2014, a foggy site near the Petaluma Gap. Here, it allows for fleshy flavors of pear, brioche and honey, offering ripeness within a classic structure of minerality. Intense in tension and body, it has a dark color and a lingering tease of honeycomb."
US,87,55,Sangiovese,red,Tre Nova 2010 Bonatello Riserva Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This single-vineyard Sangiovese is aged 30 months in neutral oak. Sweet tomato and wild strawberry fruit carries notes of ground oregano. Despite the high alcohol, it doesn't finish with any heat, just a hint of dark chocolate."
US,89,24,Merlot,red,Phantom Rivers 2010 Still Waters Vineyard Merlot (Paso Robles),"Prune, stewed plum and warm cranberry sauce blend with anise and brown spice on the nose of this wine from Paso Robles' Eastside. The flavors, framed by good acid and tannins, are evenly presented red fruits, with a distinct strawberry finish."
US,87,30,Pinot Noir,red,Clos du Val 2006 Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"You'll find this Pinot Noir drier, earthier, tarter and even more tannic than most coastal bottlings. It has flavors of cherry skins, black raspberries, cola, peppery spices and herbs. Drink now–2010."
France,92,67,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château le Prieuré 2012  Saint-Émilion,"A ripe bold wine with generous black fruits, it is a blend of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc. Dark and concentrated, it brings together rich fruitiness and firm tannins that will allow it to age. Drink from 2018. The wine comes from a vineyard that is currently in biodynamic conversion."

US,92,100,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Etude 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"This is a very nice Cabernet that feels rich in the mouth, a wine that will have everybody remarking on its smooth, velvety texture. Taste-wise, it shows an olive tinge to the red and black cherry fruit, with a beautiful overlay of smoky oak. You can drink it now, with a good decant, and it should develop in the bottle over the next 6–9 years, if not longer."
US,88,15,Pinot Gris,white,Eola Hills 2015 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"Here is a good all-purpose and widely available Oregon Pinot Gris. It's got classic pear and apple fruit flavors, well balanced against tangy acidity. There's no oak here, but the whole cluster press brings some spicy phenolics."
US,93,48,Chardonnay,white,Mount Eden Vineyards 2004 Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Mount Eden's estate Chardonnay typically starts out life as a tight, nervous wine. It's marked by acidity and minerals, and you don't want to drink it too cold. The '04 is a lovely young wine, rich and dramatically complex, with layers of pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes, wet stone, creamy yeast and smoky oak, like an important Chablis. Brilliant now, it should develop additional bottle nuances over the next six years."
Italy,93,85,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Castello dei Rampolla 2006 Sammarco Cabernet Sauvignon (Toscana),"Here's a beautiful Tuscan expression of Cabernet Sauvignon (with tiny percentages of Sangiovese and Merlot) that rolls smoothly over the palate thanks to the wine's natural richness, purity and overall intensity. Aromas include ripe berry, blue flower and exotic spice, but the wine is especially successful in the mouth thanks to the fullness of its texture."
US,89,15,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Wellington 1994 Mohrhardt Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"The grapes used to make this wine were sourced from the Fort Ross area of the far Sonoma Coast. The wine has thick, supple tannins and fine acidity. It shows earthy flavors of black currant, charred meat and cedar. Give it some airing, and drink it with steaks and chops."
US,92,44,Pinot Noir,red,Dragonette 2012 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"There is a deeply sanguine sense to the nose of this appellation blend by the Buellton-based winery, with bloody meats and graphite giving way to ripe raspberry fruit, brown spices and chopped herbs. It's very spicy once sipped, with black pepper, mocha and red fruits upholding more iron and pencil-shaving flavors on the palate."
US,87,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hall 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Defines a ripe, slightly alcoholic style of Napa Cab for drinking over the next few years. It's dry and stylishly smooth in tannins, with a nice array of blackberries, currants, cola and sweet cedar wood."
US,91,38,Pinot Noir,red,Balletto 2011 Winery Block Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"With moderate alcohol, this Pinot is silky and delicate in the mouth, with excellent acidity. Yet it's intense in sunshiney-ripe raspberries and cherries, as well as a hint of mushrooms that will become more pronounced with age. Defines the lighter style of California Pinot, in a gracious, elegant style."
Italy,86,30,White Blend,white,Antonio Caggiano 2007 FiaGre White (Campania),"This distinctive wine boasts aromas of pine resin and maple syrup that add spicy accents to this otherwise fruit-driven white wine from Campania. You can feel the southern sunshine in the mouth thanks to the wine's slightly sweet nature and powerful finish. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers."
US,84,12,Pinot Noir,red,Carmenet 2011 Pinot Noir (California),"This is a sound Pinot Noir that's common but varietally correct. Silky in texture, it's dry and crisp with acidity, accented with pink bubblegum, raspberry-pie filling and spice flavors."
US,90,69,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,DeLille 2013 Four Flags Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"A blend of Cabernet from Grand Ciel (31%), Ciel du Cheval (30%), Upchurch (28%) and Klipsun (11%) vineyards, wood spice aromas start out up front. The cherry flavors are light and elegant, with the tannins bringing some grip."
Italy,88,35,Sangiovese,red,Baccinetti 2009 Saporaia  (Brunello di Montalcino),"This wine, which has a surprisingly evolved light garnet color with some brick on the edges, opens with a delicate floral perfume of violet, red berry and cinnamon. The spicy palate offers red cherry, white pepper, clove and cinnamon alongside fleeting tannins and a note of warm alcohol. Not much weight or complexity and extremely approachable for such a young Brunello."
US,90,25,Syrah,red,Andrew Murray 1999 Les Coteaux Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"From hillside vineyards, here's a concentrated, intense wine with some tongue-sticking tannins. Blackberry, espresso and white-pepper aromas lead to a round, full-bodied and very dry wine that will benefit from a year or so of cellaring."
US,90,29,Red Blend,red,Mosquito Fleet 2011 Sophia Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is an unusual blend of 72% Syrah with the rest equal parts Mourvèdre and Cabernet Sauvignon. It largely works, with aromas of black pepper, cocoa, coffee, herbs and brown spices. The cranberry and meat flavors offer a sense of balance and restraint along with a pleasing mouthfeel and flavors that linger."
France,85,30,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château les Bertrands 2014 Nectar des Bertrands  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),This Dubois family wine is soft and fruity with attractive blackberry fruits and light tannins. Drink this generous wine from 2018.
France,88,17,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Haut Mouleyre 2016  Bordeaux Blanc,"This delicious wine from old Sémillon vines offers a hint of nuts and spice as well as crisp, clean fruit. It is lively with acidity as well as having a richer side. The wine will be just right from the end of 2017."
US,91,35,Red Blend,red,Gård 2013 Vaucluse Lawrence Vineyards Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is a blend of Syrah (76%), Grenache (21%) and Viognier (3%). Perfumed aromas of orange peel, flowers, spice and dark fruit lead to plump raspberry and smoked meat flavors. It needs time to unwind."
US,94,60,Chardonnay,white,Gary Farrell 2014 Durell Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"From the rocky, volcanic soils of Durell, this white is exuberant in salty rock and sea spray, showing plenty of influence from the Pacific Ocean to its west. Sturdy in structure and length, the fruit is twisted in pink grapefruit and crisp apple, its underbelly a richer, warmer expression of toffee and caramel."
France,94,75,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château la Fleur-Pétrus 2000  Pomerol,"This is a wonderful, dense wine, very concentrated, very intensely flavored. At this stage of its development, it is the opulence which is most evident, but there are already hints that it will show pure fruit alongside sweet tannins, and will develop complexity."
Italy,86,20,Red Blend,red,Astorre Noti 2011  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,"Aromas of charred earth, overripe plum, game and a confectionary note lead the nose of this blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo-Mammolo. The simple, rather rustic palate offers dried black cherry, leather and a hint of clove alongside dusty tannins."
US,86,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Hanna 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Stainless steel-fermented and aged, this cloudy white offers a spritzy acidity and steely texture. Fig, flint, grass and lemon flavors highlight its light-bodied imprint."
US,87,50,Pinot Noir,red,Soléna 2012 Domaine Danielle Laurent Pinot Noir,"This offers light, brambly strawberry and cherry fruit, along with hints of fresh herb, Dr Pepper and licorice. It's pleasant but somewhat insubstantial."
US,85,17,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Jekel 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Arroyo Seco),"Nearly opaque in color, the wine offers slight blackberry on the nose with a touch of pie crust. Despite some berry persistence, the flavors lean toward the savory side of Cab, with violet, tobacco and wild game."
Italy,87,29,Sangiovese,red,Ormanni 2011 Borro del Diavolo Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Aromas of oak, coconut, vanilla, espresso and charred earth come together on this structured wine. The aromas carry over to the full-bodied palate along with prune, raisin and a confectionary note. Bracing tannins clench the finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unfurl then drink to catch what remains of the fruit."
US,92,22,Zinfandel,red,Three 2013 Old Vines Zinfandel (Contra Costa County),"It's amazing how this super-concentrated wine smells like chocolate cherries and tastes almost like blackberry syrup, yet it's nice and dry in style. A firm coating of fine tannins gives grip on the tongue and seems to extend the juicy fruit and dark chocolate notes on the finish."
US,87,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Darms Lane 2010 Bon Passe Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"While this is a good, sound Cabernet, it is not the winery's finest effort. Dry in style with black currant flavors that are austere, the wine is more notable for its tannins and acidity. Drink up."
US,89,42,Pinot Noir,red,Witching Stick 2012 Dowser's Cuvee Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Nicely balanced and smooth, this starts with red cherry and raspberry aromas with hints of spice. It continues to fresh, tangy fruit flavors with a lively, bright texture. A nice touch of tannin firms up the finish."
Italy,92,65,Red Blend,red,Caiarossa 2010 Red (Toscana),"A blend of seven grapes (Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Sangiovese, Petit Verdot and Alicante), this elegantly structured wine opens with aromas of toast, coffee, black pepper and dark-skinned fruit. The polished palate offers black cherries, espresso, mocha and oak-driven spice alongside firm but refined tannins."
US,85,42,Pinot Noir,red,Olson Ogden 2006 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A little ungainly at first blush, with tannicly sharp elbows and some green, minty flavors. But it shows some pretty cherries and spices, and is dry and silky."
US,88,20,Chardonnay,white,Concannon 2007 Reserve Chardonnay (Livermore Valley),"Oak and lees give rich, yeasty, butterscotchy complexities, and a creamy texture, to this fine young Chardonnay. Fortunately, the underlying varietal flavors are strong in pineapple, apple, honeydew and papaya. Only 500 cases were produced."
France,88,21,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Château La Dournie 2012 Etienne Red (Saint-Chinian),"A blend of 60% Syrah, 25% Grenache and 15% Carignan, meaty aromas are center-stage in the bouquet, with supporting tones of black currant and licorice. It's dense and dark on the palate, with plush flavors of cherry and Bakers chocolate that carry through to the medium-weight close."
US,82,10,White Blend,white,Cottonwood Creek 2010 White (California),"For 10 bucks you get a decent, 10 buck wine. Nothing fancy, just fruity, off-dry and crisply drinkable."
France,93,94,Chardonnay,white,Chartron et Trébuchet 2013 Les Embazées Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),"This offers a tight texture, toast and spice flavors, and intense juicy acidity. With a firm structure and concentration, it has potential for long-term aging. The yellow fruits are beginning to open up while the more citric character is already giving the wine great freshness. Drink from 2018."
US,88,84,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Chateau Margene 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Enormously fruity and ripe, this Cab explodes with blackberry, blueberry, currant, and chocolate flavors that can only develop in a warm region. Yet there's enough of an acid-tannin structure to give it balance. Try pairing with steak with a gorgonzola cream sauce."
US,92,65,Pinot Noir,red,Torii Mor 2006 Olson Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"The flavors are sappy and spicy and full, and the wine has a pleasing depth and richness. The fruits run through red and purple berries and lead into hints of chocolate and leaf. The winemaking is polished and confident, and yet Jacques Tardy has left just enough roughness in the flavors to give the wine personality and character. May be cellared for up to a decade."
US,87,26,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Stinson 2011 Meritage Red (Virginia),"A butterscotch note hits the nose first, before fading to reveal scents of tea, leather and cedary spices. Medium to full-bodied, the succulent palate bears a supple core with a mineral edge. A flavor of dried strawberry marks the tangy finish. This is a blend of 35% Merlot, 25% Petit Verdot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc."
US,88,20,Red Blend,red,Zerba Cellars 2007 Wild Z Red (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"Zerba's crowd-pleasing Wild Z blends Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah about equally, with a splash of Cabernet Franc to finish it off. It's a ripe, full, forward, chocolaty mouthful. It keeps the red fruit tart and tantalizing, while loading in the barrel flavors (French and American) to round off the finish. A fine follow-up to the excellent 2006."
Italy,86,11,Syrah,red,Tasca d'Almerita 2009 Sallier de la Tour Syrah (Sicilia),"A great value wine, this fruity Syrah opens with bright blueberry, cherry and plum woven between subtle nuances of leather, spice and smoked bacon."
US,85,13,Chardonnay,white,Noble Vines 2011 446 Chardonnay (Monterey),"This hits it right in the sweet spot for Chardonnay-loving consumers, with buttered toast, honey and grilled pineapple flavors. It's part of Delicato Family Vineyards' Noble Vines series."
Italy,88,15,Red Blend,red,Torrevento 2012 Faneros Red (Salice Salentino),"A blend of Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera, this savory wine offers aromas of blue flower, spiced plum, nutmeg and a whiff of game. The fresh, easy palate delivers juicy blackberry, crushed raspberry and cranberry alongside ground pepper and a licorice note. Velvety tannins give it a smooth texture."
US,87,49,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Ahnfeldt 2005 Quid Pro Quo Red (Napa Valley),"Very ripe in the modern style, with masses of jammy blackberries, black currants and black cherries and uplifted, smoky notes of oak. The tannins are thick and astringent. One defect is a certain sharpness that lasts through the finish and makes the mouthfeel tart."
US,90,18,Pinot Noir,red,Vinum Ferus 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Quite tart, in a bracing, food friendly way, this foot-stomped rosé brings pretty notes of crushed roses and sweet cherries to the fore. There's impressive body and length, with a lick of citrus extending the finish."
US,89,22,Pinot Noir,red,Melrose 2015 Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"Round and fruity, this differs from Willamette Valley Pinots, in that it's broad, fruit-driven, perhaps less complex but readily accessible and quite delicious immediately. Cherry lollipop, oranges and light tropical-fruit flavors abound. Drink while it's young and fresh—slightly chilled if you wish."
France,84,45,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Jayer-Gilles 2007  Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Beaune,"Pleasant, soft wine, easy to drink, its fruits round and somewhat dilute. It doesn't resonate, but is certainly fresh and crisp."
France,90,75,Pinot Noir,red,Louis Latour 2015 Domaine Latour  (Aloxe-Corton),The wine has a good structure with sophisticated tannins and perfumed acidity. Black cherry and spice from the wood are balanced by the freshness of the acidity and the rounded aftertaste. Drink from 2019.
US,88,24,Pinot Noir,red,Spangler 2006 Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"This is Oregon Pinot from the Columbia Gorge AVA. This new region is still defining itself, but on first blush it's warmer, with more ripe, sweet strawberry fruit and very little of the herbal, resiny, tomato leaf character of most Oregon Pinots in this price range. This is sweet, jammy, spicy and thick, with fruit compote flavors dominating."
US,86,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hearst Ranch 2010 Bunkhouse Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Here's a good, easy drinking Cabernet for drinking now with Cab-friendly fare, like a barbecued flank steak. It's dry and full-bodied, with ripe blackberry, currant and spice flavors."
US,84,14,Merlot,red,Gen5 2010 Merlot (Clarksburg),"This is a slightly syrupy Merlot that has flavors of overripe plum, black pepper and vanilla, especially on the finish. The blend is mostly Merlot with small amounts of Petite Sirah, Malbec, Cabernet and Zinfandel, all from Clarksburg, a cool subregion near Lodi."
US,88,26,Merlot,red,Thomas O'Neil Cellars 2009 Fahrenheit 100 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This pure Merlot has the grip and muscle often found in Washington fruit; in fact, it's a bit tight at first. Notes of red plum, strawberry and stiff tannins carry the medium finish, with a nice hint of dried herb."
US,88,34,Pinot Noir,red,Jasper Sisco 2014 Zenith Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This Pinot is lightly peppery with fruit flavors of watermelon and strawberry. They're expanded with generous skin phenolic flavors from 50% whole cluster fermentation, then softened with aging in neutral oak. Though a light wine overall, it's complex and holds your attention."
US,82,8,Pinot Noir,red,Smoking Loon 2008 Pinot Noir (California),"Pretty harsh and unrewarding, even for this price. It's soft and simple, with Lifesaver raspberry flavors."
US,88,20,Red Blend,red,Sketchbook 2012 The Artist Red (Mendocino),"This nicely balanced, medium-bodied wine has fresh, bright flavors, a firm mouthfeel and enough complexity to demand attention. Unlike so many heavy, slightly sweet red blends this one is moderate and appetizingly dry."
US,93,48,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Shafer 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Continues the Shafer tradition of richly fruity Cabs, with near-perfect tannins and just-right oak, and an elegant suppleness that's delicious and distinctive in youth, but ageworthy. The fine vintage has made the wine extra-complex and balanced. Over the years, many wineries have arisen, but few have a better track record than Shafer."
France,91,114,Pinot Noir,red,Bouchard Père & Fils 2007 Les Cailles Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),"An already complete wine, the tannins well integrated into the firm black fruits and acidity. It is foursquare but also has a richness that comes from wood as well as lively final freshness."
Italy,91,90,Red Blend,red,Orma 2013 Red (Toscana),"A blend of 50% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Cabernet Franc, this offers aromas of ripe black currant, tilled earth and tobacco. The full-bodied palate doles out black cherry, cedar and mocha alongside ample velvety tannins. Drink 2017–2023."
US,89,35,Pinot Noir,red,David Hill 2012 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Bright fruit flavors of mountain berries are bolstered with steely acidity. This firm, lightly herbal wine sneaks in a hint of clover as well. It may improve with another couple of years of bottle age."
US,84,20,Zinfandel,red,Grands Amis Winery 2008 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),A sweet Lodi Zin with much chocolate and mint from beginning to end.
Italy,88,34,Sangiovese,red,Querciavalle 2006 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Here's a classic and fresh interpretation of Chianti Classico that is light and crisp without being too thin or sharp. In fact, ripe fruit tones of blueberry and cassis do a nice job of smoothing out the overall effect."
US,92,56,Pinot Noir,red,Foxen 2009 Bien Nacido Vineyard Block 8 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Exceptionally rich, a Pinot Noir that tastes dramatic from the get go. It's full-bodied, dry and velvety, with complex flavors of berries, pomegranates, cherries, cola, currants, mushrooms and spices. The firm tannins and crisp acids suggest ageability over the next six years."
US,86,28,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Brander 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"Lean and tough, but not without a certain charm, this Cab's blackberry and currant flavors are wrapped in hard, edgy tannins. The sweet core of fruit will wake up when paired with rich beef dishes."
Italy,87,80,Red Blend,red,Domìni Veneti 2008 Villa  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"Dense and extracted, this opens with aromas of cherry marinated in spirits, prune, ground black pepper and leather. The syrupy palate offers blackberry extract, licorice, espresso and toasted oak alongside teeth-coating tannins and almost searing alcohol."
France,89,17,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Puyanché 2016  Francs Côtes de Bordeaux,"Apricot and ripe yellow and white stone fruit flavors mark this wine as warm and soft, with a generous texture. It's rounded and finishes with almond and spice notes. Drink now."
US,88,25,Pinot Noir,red,Estancia 2005 Stonewall Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is a very good Pinot Noir that shows how well the appellation can balance the variety. It has lush cherry, blackberry, tea, cola and cocoa flavors, and a rich, silky texture. Could develop bottle complexity over the next six years."
US,86,27,Chardonnay,white,Barrel Oak 2008 Reserve Chardonnay (Virginia),"Fresh, appley and floral with a touch of tangy yogurt cream, this is an approachable yet elegant Virginia pick. Delicate apple and pear flavors shine through on this full-bodied wine with fresh acidity, supple texture and balanced alcohol."
US,91,29,Chardonnay,white,Kessler-Haak 2015 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"This Chardonnay from Dan Kessler and Ellen Haak-Kessler is a blend of of clones 95 and 76, featuring tangerine, pear, and chamomile on the nose. The palate is framed by tension and bright acidity, opening up to riper flavors of peach and melon, with a hint of sea salt."
US,94,50,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Gramercy 2011 The Third Man Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Grenache and Syrah are the mainstays here, with a splash of Mourvèdre completing the Third Man blend. For the first time, Uplands contributes some of the fruit. It's immensely fragrant, fruity, peppery and rich with flavors of strawberry, raspberry, cherry and plum. There is nothing simple here; scents and flavors compound and linger, and the more you look, the more you find."
US,89,16,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Morgan 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey),"This is a real New Zealand-style Sauvignon Blanc. It's dry and tart, with rich gooseberry, lime, green apple, Asian pear, vanilla and white pepper flavors. A touch of oak brings a pleasant, buttery toastiness. The grapes come from the cool Arroyo Seco AVA and the warm San Lucas AVA, a brilliant blending decision that makes this wine especially balanced."
US,88,100,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,B.R. Cohn 1997 Olive Hill Estate Vyds Special Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Crisp in the nose, with nuances of graham cracker, menthol, mushroom and herbs. Those herbal notes carry into the flavor profile and mix with plum and oak. It opens up a little and becomes fairly friendly on the finish, where the tannins are medium."
US,86,24,Pinot Noir,red,McFadden 2012 Estate Grown Organically Grown Grapes Pinot Noir (Potter Valley),"Tasty and no-nonsense, this shows cherry and blackberry flavors along with leafy aromas. It is juicy, fresh, moderately tannic, firm-textured, appetizing and well made."
US,88,20,Chardonnay,white,Shale Canyon 2010 Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),"Brisk acidity and a steely, minerally dryness make this Chardonnay particularly savory. The citrus flavors suggest limes and Meyer lemons, with suggestions of toast and vanilla. It's an elegant wine and easily worth the price."
US,86,16,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Simi 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"Grass and apricot scents define the nose of this lively, refreshing wine—a simple study in vanilla and ripely sweetened peach that was fermented entirely in stainless steel tanks."
US,87,16,Zinfandel,red,Hullabaloo 2012 Old Vines Zinfandel (Lodi),"This wine plays tricks on the palate, tasting much lighter in body than its alcohol suggests. Layered with red fruit along with a lift of herb, it is structured and composed, with a long, lingering finish. This is a good one to stock up on if you love big Zin with a smaller footprint."
US,95,78,Chardonnay,white,Hanzell 2012 Ramos Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"This marks the debut of the Ramos Vineyard Chardonnay, inspired by a high-elevation site planted in 2001 by the late Bob Sessions and Jose Ramos, now director of vineyard operations. The wine paints a portrait of high-toned, elegant minerality accented by peach and lithe lemon. Capable of aging, it dances in acidity, with just a hint of caramel-vanilla on the finish. Made in tiny quantities, it's worth desperately seeking out."
US,90,35,Red Blend,red,Kuleto Estate 2013 Frog Prince Red (Napa County),"This is a well-made blend of 53% Merlot, 24% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc, 6% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot. It is among the producer's “curious blends,” created from estate properties in different styles. Here, firm, structured and present tannins dominate an otherwise concentrated and spicy mix of black licorice, clove and tobacco."
US,87,58,Syrah,red,Bergevin Lane 2008 Barrel Select Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The Barrel Select is given 26 months in 100% new oak, and it shows in both the nose and the mouth. Smoke and char are not accents here; they are the main event. The fruit flavors are simple cherry/berry, and thin out rather quickly in the finish."
US,89,52,Pinot Noir,red,Love & Squalor 2014 Sunny Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Small production (one barrel!) single-vineyard Pinots are challenging, as there is no wiggle room via blending. This comes out crisp and focused, with light cherry fruit and ample flavors of tea, herb and leaf."
US,94,75,Pinot Noir,red,Wedell Cellars 2012 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"English breakfast tea, light plum, dark strawberry, rhubarb, thyme and lavender swirl in the heady nose of this bottling. It's elegant and floral on the palate, with more lavender and lots of bergamot and Earl Grey flavors that linger long through the finish."
US,94,85,Pinot Noir,red,Iron Horse 2013 Deer Gate Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"A warmth of baking spices like cardamom and nutmeg charge an otherwise earthy, herbal wine. It's light bodied yet complex, crisp in strawberry and black cherry flavors. Only the third vintage produced from this particular site, it's subtly ripe and lengthy in texture."
France,92,60,White Blend,white,Gérard Bertrand 2011 Cigalus White (Aude Hauterive),"This blend of 71% Chardonnay, 23% Viognier and 6% Sauvignon Blanc offers good concentration and ample richness, with pure yet powerful aromas and flavors of wood-grilled apple, peach pit, beeswax and yellow melon rind. Accents of toasted challah and pressed yellow flowers add depth to the bouquet, while finishing touches of orange oil and sweet spice unfold on the round, lush finish. Drink now–2018."
France,87,23,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Dominique Gruhier 2011 Côte de Grisey  (Bourgogne Epineuil),"Epineuil is a region between Burgundy and Chablis, producing light, fruity Pinot Noir. This perfumed and dusty wine does show some firm tannins. It is bright with red currant and raspberry fruits, with a fresh aftertaste."
US,92,45,Pinot Noir,red,August West 2011 Graham Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A gorgeous wine that shows delicate silkiness and complexity, with a light, airy mouthfeel. Yet it's enormously rich and concentrated in raspberries and cherries. Crisp acidity makes for a clean finish, making this Pinot worth repeated sipping."
US,87,42,Merlot,red,Grgich Hills 2010 Estate Grown Merlot (Napa Valley),"From the southern end of the Napa Valley, where temperatures tend to be cool, this wine is surprisingly intense in tannin and a deep taste of coffee, rounded out by spicy red plum and strawberry. The acidity holds tight through the finish, making this a friendly food wine."
US,86,20,Red Blend,red,Cougar Crest 2012 Dedication Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Coming in at a strikingly low alcohol for the vintage, the fruit in this blend doesn't seem to have fully ripened, with strong aromas of freshly sliced jalapeño along with leafy herbs. The flavors are tart and elegant, broadening on the finish."
US,91,58,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Mark Ryan 2014 Dead Horse Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"Ciel du Cheval, Klipsun, Obelisco and Quintessence make up this wine. The aromas of smoke, dark plum, cocoa, herb and spice lead to black-fruit flavors that show a sense of sophistication. There's no question it comes from a warm vintage and region but it shows a judicious touch."
US,88,36,Syrah,red,Moxy 2013 Basket Pressed Syrah (Paso Robles),"This wine shows somewhat generic black and purple-fruit aromas, with a hint of purple flowers as well. The palate picks up the pace with brown sugar, pork fat, juicy boysenberry fruit and touches of white pepper, violet and fennel."
US,86,22,Chardonnay,white,V. Sattui 2008 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Simple in buttered popcorn and toast flavors, this Chard has underlying flavors of pineapples. It's a dry wine, crisp in acidity. Made in the popular style for drinking now."
US,89,10,White Blend,white,Big House 2007 White White (California),"The Muscat Canelli in the blend really stands out, offering tangerine aromas and flavors. But additional fruit and spice complexities are offered by Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier, among other varieties. Crisply acidic and dry, this is an outstanding white wine, and a versatile one at the table. Sommeliers, buy this by the case."
US,91,26,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Chandon 2010 Chardonnay (Carneros),"A very particular Chardonnay that shows the dual properties of ripe, delicious fruit and acidic, minerally earthiness. Flavors veer toward citrus and tropical fruits, while oak brings lovely notes of vanilla and buttered toast. Great price for a Chard of this distinction and class."
US,94,155,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Signorello 2010 Padrone Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, grown in the winery's estate vineyard, on the east side of Napa Valley. It's awesomely rich and ripe, delivering heady blackberry, blueberry, cassis liqueur, cola and new oak flavors that are as long in the finish as they are deep. With thick tannins, it's clearly a wine you need to cellar. Drink 2016–2020 and beyond."
US,81,10,Merlot,red,Shiloh Road 2007 Merlot (North Coast),"Drinkable, but just barely, even at this everyday price. It's soft and cloyingly sweet, with raspberry and cocoa flavors."
Italy,87,33,Sangiovese,red,Villa Calcinaia 2005 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"A sweet, almond- and vanilla-driven nose marks this pretty bottling. The oak element is evident, especially in the mouth, where the wine shows some bitterness in terms of its tannins."
France,94,95,Chardonnay,white,Bouchard Père & Fils 2011 Perrières Premier Cru  (Meursault),"At this stage, this wine is closed, tight and mineral in character. As befits a great Perrières, it will be a serious, structured wine, textured and full of nervy, steely feeling, softening later into mature spice and toast. Drink from 2016."
Italy,87,10,Pinot Grigio,white,Mezzacorona 2015 Pinot Grigio (Trentino),"Heady aromas of yellow stone fruit, grapefruit and a touch of light baking spice lead the way. The full-bodied palate shows apricot, yellow peach, mineral and a hint of nutmeg alongside lively acidity that leaves a tangy finish."
US,90,20,Zinfandel,red,Maddalena 2014 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Stewed strawberries, blackberry jam, maple, brown sugar, black pepper, teriyaki and pork fat show on the lush nose of this bargain bottling. It's soft on the palate, with fruity strawberry and ripe plum flavors, as well as some more serious beef char elements. It's fun, easy and delicious."
US,91,56,Pinot Noir,red,Pali 2011 Windsor Oaks Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a big, ripe, oaky Pinot Noir. Considering how cold the vintage was, it was quite an achievement to produce such powerful raspberry, cherry and plum fruit flavors. The wine is dry, elegantly tailored and vibrant in acidity, and should peak by 2017."
US,88,18,Riesling,white,Ancestry 2012 Reminiscence Riesling (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"Hailing from Underwood Mountain, this is cool climate Riesling made in a warm vintage with notes of lime, guava and mineral. It has a healthy amount of residual sugar (37 g/L) but the acid (8.4g/L) creates a pleasing sense of tension and makes it seemingly drier."
France,84,12,Pinot Noir,red,L. Tramier & Fils 2010 Bourricot Pinot Noir (Vin de France),"This is a soft, gentle Pinot with a plum jelly flavor derived from a touch of sweetness in its fruit. Drink now."
US,91,48,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Divio 2012 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Light raspberry fruit carries a suggestion of clean earth and dried herb. The tannins show some substantial grip. The overall balance is fine, though the wine drinks younger than most 2012s. Best after 2020."
US,92,60,Pinot Noir,red,Lucie 2010 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Lots of ripe, cheerful flavors of raspberry and cherry jam and cola are found in this vibrant wine. It shows oak, too, in the form of sweet buttered cinnamon toast. The mouthfeel is pure Pinot: silky, velvety and delicate. Delicious for drinking now with everything from grilled steak to ahi tuna."
Italy,86,15,Red Blend,red,Fattoria Fibbiano 2011 Le Pianette Red (Toscana),"Simple, clean and bright, Le Pianette is all about fresh fruit. The blend is 70-30 Sangiovese and Colorino, and it offers lively cherry and blueberry notes."
US,86,14,Riesling,white,Montezuma 2010 Riesling (Finger Lakes),"This off-dry Riesling has exuberant aromas of orange blossoms and ripe red berries. It balances concentrated apple and honey flavors with flashes of green herbs and brisk, lime-tinged acidity. So light and dainty, it's easy to drink."
US,91,24,Riesling,white,Penner-Ash 2015 Riesling (Willamette Valley),"Dry and sappy, this potent effort is heavily influenced by botanical flavors, to the point of being almost grassy. Dry extract and lemon/lime acidity keep the riper fruit flavors in check, but with ample breathing time the wine fills in with highlights of fresh peaches."
France,89,40,Pinot Noir,red,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2011  Volnay,"The wine has weight, and dense tannins at this stage. What does give it a hint of Volnay's generosity is the warm, full fruit that is behind the structure. It's obviously going to need at least three years to soften out into a more rounded wine."
US,87,34,Red Blend,red,JR Wine 2009 The Devious Woman Red (Napa Valley),"Well-made and creatively blended from Zinfandel, Syrah and Petite Sirah, this is a big, tannic wine, formidable in sweet blackberry, cherry, licorice and spice flavors. It's not subtle, but it is authentic. Drink now."
US,93,125,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Blackbird Vineyards 2012 Illustration Red (Napa Valley),"This blend combines 64% Merlot with 34% Cabernet Franc and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon to nice effect, offering cranberry and red, juicy plum around softly cradled tannins and well-resolved oak. Juicy, structured and fully balanced, the finish sparks elements of leather with tobacco."
France,85,27,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Jeanguillon 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur,"The wine is packed with fruit (including red berries) and attractive acidity. It has tannins that are still very present, although they are now supporting the bright fruitiness of the wine. It's almost ready to drink; just wait until 2018."
Italy,88,38,Sangiovese,red,Drei Donà 2013 Pruno Riserva Sangiovese (Romagna),"This deeply colored wine opens with aromas of black-skinned berry, cedar and vanilla. On the dense palate, notes of toast and tobacco underscore mature black plum. Assertive tannins leave a mouthcoating finish. Drink through 2020."
US,87,25,Chardonnay,white,Orfila 2011 Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Rich in oak barrel and caramel vanilla, this presents plenty of pear and lemon, even lemon meringue flavors. Ample acidity adds brightness, making this a good match for mussels or roast chicken."
US,88,50,Pinot Noir,red,Chehalem 2011 Stoller Vineyards Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"The Stoller-sourced Pinot is forward and ripe, with pretty fruit flavors in a compact, light vintage. Cola, peach, black cherry and milk chocolate components swirl together, fading gently into a light finish. Drink over the next 2–3 years."
US,86,25,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Freemark Abbey 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Part stainless-steel fermented and part barrel-fermented, this wine showcases a happy medium between crispness and body. It has a slight metallic edge, with integrated layers of Meyer lemon, melon and kiwi."
US,82,27,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Chateau St. Croix 2003 Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (America),"On the first sniff, the nose says Port, with caramelized, baked cherry aromas. The wine tastes dry and sharp and watery, with only a hint of Cabernet character."
US,90,25,Riesling,white,Trefethen 2015 Dry Riesling (Oak Knoll District),"From 100% estate-grown grapes, and possessing 6.8 g/L of residual sugar, this wine is lovely in peach, pear and lemon, and quite voluptuous in texture, with a hint of spice. Pretty floral aromas of jasmine provide additional flourish and invitation, with the finish dry."
Italy,87,10,Red Blend,red,Leone de Castris 2005 Maiana Rosso Red (Salice Salentino),"Here's an easy-going Salice Salentino (90% Negroamaro and 10% Malvasia Nera) with spice, cherry and cola notes that are weaved nicely together. There's harmony and elegance here and the wine leaves a spicy imprint on the close."
France,87,14,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Roc Meynard 2008  Bordeaux Supérieur,"The dry tannins are firmly in charge in this young wine, its fruit fresh rather than rich. The flavors are red plum juice, acidity and a dry core that needs another year to soften."
US,89,14,Riesling,white,Frost Bitten 2015 Riesling (Yakima Valley),"The aromas leap out of the glass, with notes of potpourri, dried orange peel and honey. It drinks sweet, with viscous-feeling flower and marmalade flavors, with white flowers lingering on the finish."
Italy,83,12,Sangiovese,red,Poggio alle Sughere 2008 Sangiovese (Toscana),"This informal Sangiovese-based red wine (in a screwcap bottle) shows bright berry nuances of cassis, cranberry and forest fruit. The wine finishes in an easy-drinking but crisp style."
US,90,32,Syrah,red,Dunites 2015 Spanish Springs Vineyard Syrah (San Luis Obispo County),"An exciting new project named after the cult that once lived in the Guadalupe dunes at the end of the Santa Maria River, this cool-climate Syrah from a vineyard just behind Pismo Beach shows rosemary, fennel frond, white pepper, tar and soy on the nose. The sip starts with a flash of blackberry syrup before the savory hints of charred beef and peppercorns arise. Still a young wine, this will improve with time."
France,96,80,Pinot Gris,white,Domaine Schoffit 2007 Clos Saint-Théobald Grand Cru Rangen Sélection de Grains Nobles Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Barley sugar, butterscotch, demerara sugar and the faintest hint of maple syrup suggest the richness of this SGN right away. The concentrated sweetness is countered with illuminating freshness and holds tons of tangy spice. Wow. This is incredibly concentrated and has an elixir-like bundled energy that seems to be alive. The effect is both mesmerizing and invigorating."
US,90,28,Chardonnay,white,J Vineyards & Winery 2014 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This is a creamy, thick and food friendly white with highlights of honey and green apple and a lingering decadence of ginger, just hinting at anise. Medium-bodied, it represents the vintage and the appellation well, at a price that's nice."
US,90,32,Chardonnay,white,Lea 2015 Mormann Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"From a newer vineyard located up Gypsy Canyon off of Highway 246, this wine shows light apple aromas along with lemon blossoms. Ripe yellow pears and apples show through a stony tightness that frames the midpalate, offering a Key-lime pith element and good saline quality."
France,96,64,Riesling,white,Domaine Weinbach 2015 Clos des Capucins Cuvée Ste Catherine Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"A fragrant and pure nose of slightly floral tangerine peel opens this wine. It offers a ripe fruit-driven dance of aromas and freshness—think tangerine, ripe lemon, crisp apple and a beguiling floral dimension. Lovely now in its primary-flavored youth, it's certain to become even more disarming in the future. Drink 2020–2035 or later if you like it really mature."
US,92,24,Riesling,white,Brooks 2015 Orchard Fold Vineyard Riesling (Eola-Amity Hills),"Lovely aromatics conjure up rose petals, a dash of body powder and ripe citrus. The fruit is very ripe, with almost a candy character, and there's a sensation of powdered sugar. But despite the almost 14g/L residual sugar, it's more sweet/tart than syrupy, keeping it sappy and refreshing."
US,84,65,Merlot,red,The Williamsburg Winery 2006 Adagio Merlot (Virginia),"A beautiful dark plum color and elegant aromas of cherry, allspice and pepper lead this Virginia Merlot. Rich and savory notes and a bright fruit character are appealing but need time to age and integrate. Overall, a solid red for the cellar."
US,84,20,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Terre Rouge 1997 Red (Sierra Foothills),"A bit rough and sharp, with earthy-jammy flavors and a peppery finish. It's a lightly structured wine with thin flavors and a bite of acidity, and dry. Calls for simple foods, the heartier the better. A Rhône blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah."
US,86,12,White Blend,white,Waterbrook 2016 Mélange Founder's White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Riesling and Gewürztraminer make up over half of this wine, giving it an aromatic punch. Vibrant ripe peach, flower and pear scents lead to an off-dry palate with fleshy fruit flavors. It provides easy-drinking appeal, though the concentration, especially through the midpalate, seems light."
Italy,96,169,Merlot,red,Castello di Ama 2006 L'Apparita Merlot (Toscana),"L'Apparita is a divine and delicate expression of Merlot with rich layers of black cherry, blackberry, spice, mocha, cedar, exotic spice and polished stone that are seamlessly woven together. The wine hits the palate with the softness and richness of the world's best Merlots and leaves a fading impression of fruit and spice that can be counted in many long, delicious minutes. Hold until 2018."
US,93,75,Pinot Noir,red,Adelsheim 2013 Ribbon Springs Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"Among the impressive single-vineyard Adelsheim Pinots, this is the only one from this tiny AVA. It's loaded with bright, sparky cranberry and raspberry fruit, whose juicy flavors hit the palate's bullseye. The penetrating power is underscored with minerally acidity. Drink now through 2030."
US,93,40,Pinot Noir,red,Long Meadow Ranch 2015 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This new wine from an estate vineyard is the strong, quiet type that's not effusively fruity but instead emphasizes mineral elements and great structure. An attractive chalky, spicy aroma leads to beautifully restrained red cherry and pomegranate flavors that seem to grow and expand with each sip. The texture is firmly tannic but also polished, supported by perfect acidity that keeps everything sharp and focused."
US,92,60,Pinot Noir,red,Bergström 2010 Temperance Hill Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"The pretty fragrance comes with cotton candy highlights, along with a note of tangy red fruit. It's concentrated and deep, with appealing purity of flavor and the structure to age for over a decade."
US,94,64,Pinot Noir,red,Arista 2013 Longbow Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Longbow is a blend of several vineyard sites otherwise vineyard-designated by the producer, a chance to showcase winemaker Matt Courtney's way with fruit. In his first vintage at Arista, he excels in crafting a wine exuberant in high-toned black cherry and structured, silky tannin, lengthy and fresh in aromas of rose petal and cinnamon."
US,88,14,Red Blend,red,Clif Family 2010 The Climber Red (California),"Made from Zinfandel, Cabernet Franc and a few other varieties, this is a terrific wine for your house red. It's dry and lusty, with berry, spice and tobacco flavors that have a touch of raisining. Production was 6,300 cases."
Italy,86,13,White Blend,white,Principe di Corleone 2015 Pollara White (Terre Siciliane),"A 50-50 blend of Catarratto and Chardonnay, this opens with aromas that recall Spanish broom and ripe orchard fruit. The bright, simple palate offers yellow apple and citrus alongside fresh acidity."
US,92,42,Zinfandel,red,Quivira 2015 Anderson Ranch Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Robustly concentrated, this is a rich rewarding wine exuberantly layered in black raspberry and blackberry flavor. Boldly structured, with depth and length for days, it hits the palate with pleasing jolts of cinnamon, clove and black licorice."
France,84,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Domaine de l'Aurage 2015  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"This wine is marked by dry tannins and is smoky and toasty, with little sign of fruit. While it will soften, it will stay somewhat tough."
US,82,8,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Watery blackberry, mint and oak flavors mark this simple wine. It's soft and ripe on the finish."
US,87,13,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Francis Berwyn 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Here's a good, gutsy Cab that won't push Napa out of the spotlight, but offers sound drinking at a fair price. Dry and ready to drink now, it has the classic varietal flavors of black currants, black cherries and cedar."
US,85,55,Pinot Noir,red,Presqu'ile 2009 Presqu'ile Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Simple, soft and fruity-sweet in cherries and raspberries, like the spicy filling in a pie. A direct wine to drink now."
France,94,50,Riesling,white,René Muré 2012 Clos Saint Landelin Vorbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Still young and chock full of acidity, it has considerable potential. It's a tight, bright wine, the lemon zest acidity still dominant. It's going to be a major wine as it ages, keeping bone dry while developing its aromatic, beautifully fragrant side. Drink from 2019."
US,85,10,Merlot,red,Lost Angel 2009 Merlot (California),"Get a case of this and make it your house wine for easy drinking. It's dry and spicy, and has enough cherry, berry and cola flavors to satisfy your tastebuds."
US,84,18,Chardonnay,white,Geode 2006 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"Straightforward, this Chard shows well-ripened flavors of pineapple jam, nectarines, peaches and vanilla. It finishes with caramelized, butterscotchy sweetness."
US,92,54,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,AronHill NV Berrichon Red (Paso Robles),"From a vineyard and winery founded in 1996 by Judy Aron (one of the first women vintners in the region), this blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 20% Malbec and 10% Petit Verdot shows fresh aromas of black plum, blueberry, violet, lava rocks and wet cement. The tannins are polished and soft, but provide a stiff-enough backbone to hold up black-currrant flavors that are enhanced with flashes of caramel."
US,88,42,Zinfandel,red,Wilson 2014 Sawyer Estate Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"High-toned acidity complements the generous, brambly black fruit and brown sugar notes in this wine, its savory undertone recalling leather and coffee."
US,86,15,Chardonnay,white,Lovingston 2010 Wahoo White Chardonnay (Monticello),"Scents of fresh lemons, herbs and white flowers grace this delicately structured, unoaked Chardonnay. Brisk and tonic on the palate, it's a breezy white that's perfect for summer sipping."
US,93,95,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Justin 2010 Focus Red (Paso Robles),"This is a new bottling from Justin, and it's one of its best wines in years. Blended mostly from Syrah, with a splash of Mourvèdre and Grenache, it's rich, ripe and velvety smooth. The wine shows a warm-climate touch of overripeness in the chocolate-covered raisin flavor, which gives it a Port-like warmth. Otherwise, the flavors veer toward blackberry and cassis liqueur."
US,85,22,Chardonnay,white,Custard 2013 Comfort Wine Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"Fuzzy stone fruit from apricot to peach dominate on the nose and palate in this straightforward, creamy and richer-styled wine. Batches of apple and lemon give it a crisp edge toward the middle before denser crème brûlée and vanilla take over on the finish."
US,94,85,Syrah,red,Rasa 2008 Principia Reserve Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"100% varietal, this is a strict barrel selection from key vineyards – Les Collines, Seven Hills, Lewis and Portteus. It is tight, dense, deeply detailed, and built for long term aging. Right now it's showing a fair amount of herb and forest floor, but the structure is so perfect that it doesn't matter."
France,94,60,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Giscours 2008  Margaux,"A dense wine, powerful while also elegant. It shows all the best character of a grand Margaux, with fine tannins as well as dense structure. It will age well."
US,89,32,Syrah,red,Spindrift Cellars 2006 Seven Hills Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"This tight, rather austere Syrah shows cool- climate flavors; it's hard and herbal, earthy and tannic, but there is a lot going on. It's not a fruit-driven wine, rather it has the earthy, composty complexity of a Cayuse Syrah, though less concentrated. Definitely a wine worth chasing."
France,92,53,Chardonnay,white,Alex Gambal 2014 Les Murgers des Dents de Chien Premier Cru  (Saint-Aubin),"This fine, ageworthy wine is rounded, smooth and full of ripe yellow fruit. There is a zesty tang on the back palate that will allow it to mature, its richness shining through a frame of crisp texture. Drink from 2020."
France,90,35,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Florian Roblin 2015 Coulée des Moulins Sauvignon Blanc (Coteaux du Giennois),"This producer's style is for rich wines and this is no exception. With its depth of fruit and ripe apples and lemon, it is both crisp and full. The wine has some wood aging not for the flavor, more for the open effect. Drink the wine now."
US,91,53,Chardonnay,white,Rochioli 2010 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A textbook example in how to make a Chardonnay that's ripely fruity and oaky, yet maintains impeccable balance. The orange, apricot, green apple and lime flavors hit the jackpot, while brisk acidity and minerality provide equilibrium. Possesses that rare quality of elegance."
US,86,24,Red Blend,red,Chacewater 2013 Highlander Red (Sierra Foothills),"Lots of ripe berry and pomegranate notes give a fruity profile to this dry, medium-bodied, fresh and lightly tannic wine. It will be a good quaffing wine for lunch or dinner with mushroom pizza or grilled chicken."
US,93,28,Syrah,red,Sinor-LaVallee 2014 Syrah (San Luis Obispo),"This feral and gamy wine shows roast lamb, rosemary, dried fennel, rose petal and forest floor aromas on its dynamic nose. The palate leads with explosive acidity, before waves of Concord grape and blackberry flavor take hold. It's light on its feet but has some textural firmness, finishing on rosemary, lavender and game notes."
US,86,14,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Courtney Benham 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Courtney Benham, a brand from Martin Ray, does a good, consistent job with their Sauvignon Blanc, at a fair price. The '06, like its predecessors, is dry and crisp, with succulent flavors of limes, pineapples, sweet green peas, figs and spicy vanilla. This is a good price for a wine of such sophistication."
US,80,12,Red Blend,red,Fog Hill NV Red (Napa County),Sugary and Porty. Okay in a pinch when you need something red and rustic.
France,86,12,White Blend,white,Domaine de Laballe 2016 Sables Fauves White (Landes),"From sandy soil full of iron oxide, this blend of a range of Southwest grapes comes from a vineyard close to the Atlantic coast. It is a delicious fruity wine with lively acidity, green-fruit and citrus flavors plus a juicy zesty aftertaste. Drink this refreshing wine now."
US,95,125,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Janzen 2014 Cloudy's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This remarkable wine offers soft luxury between its balance of fresh red cherry and cassis and the velvety grip of tannic concentration. Spiky persistent acidity guides a freshness of forest floor, sage and tobacco, the power entirely graceful in the glass."
US,85,30,Syrah,red,Season 2011 Syrah (Southern Oregon),"Blended with 25% Grenache, this is an enjoyable wine with notes of peppery spice and plum. It's all about mouthfeel, light fruit flavors and citrusy acidity."
US,91,40,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,àMaurice 2013 Anne Martin McCool Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this wine opens with reserved aromas of herbs and assorted barrel spices, with blackberry lurking in the background. The plimp black-fruit flavors have depth and immediate appeal."
US,91,58,Pinot Noir,red,Dutton-Goldfield 2013 Angel Camp Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This has lots of fresh, lively fruit characteristics in the aroma and the flavor. It's well balanced, showing good firm acidity and fine tannins to blanket the ripe cherry and plum flavors. It's medium bodied, very appetizing and agile."
US,89,49,Pinot Noir,red,Wrights Station 2013 Far Away Block Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Though quite light in the glass, this bottling shows dark Indian spices and cinnamon as well as strawberry and candied cherry on the nose. Those same red fruits arise on the palate, lifted by thyme, more cinnamon and a peppery spice."
US,95,52,Zinfandel,red,Williams Selyem 2011 Papera Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"This is huge in fruit, like Godzilla trampling skyscrapers underfoot. Yet it's so exquisitely balanced in all its parts, it possesses a Zen-like stillness at the center of all these massive, swirling elements. This is easily Williams Selyem's best Papera Zin yet. So rich in black raspberry jam, red currant, mocha, pepper and sweet sandalwood flavors, yet so focused, it just blows your mind."
US,88,20,Pinot Noir,red,Illahe 2010 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Fresh and pretty, this has a bright, refreshing palate that offers flavors of cranberry and raspberry. It's smooth and fruit forward, with medium aging potential."
US,84,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Markham 2010 Cellar 1879 Blend Red (Napa Valley),"Dry and sour, this has a certain rustic elegance, with a nice finish that should pair well with simple beef dishes, like tacos."
France,88,36,Chardonnay,white,Roche de Bellene 2014  Saint-Aubin,"The wine is ripe with a fine mix of generous fruits and layers of toast. It is an opulent wine, full of fruitiness and with a crisper side from juicy acidity. Produced from 48-year-old vines, it has some fine concentration that gives the wine extra richness. Drink from 2017."
US,90,14,Chardonnay,white,Barnard Griffin 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Another jazzy, Best Buy winner from Barnard Griffin, this 2011 Chardonnay should be sipped to the tune of Harry Nilsson's “Put The Lime In The Coconut,” which neatly captures the flavors. Complex fruits, including apples, citrus—and yes, coconut—add up to a wine both sleek and satisfying, with toasted almonds rounding out the finish."
France,88,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine Chavet 2015  Menetou-Salon,"This is a soft rounded wine. With a generous texture and warm white stone-fruit flavors, it is smooth with only a mild tang of clementine peel. The wine is delicious, ripe and ready to drink."
US,90,16,Pinot Noir,red,Spindrift Cellars 2016 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Pale salmon in color, but quite robust in flavor and alcohol, this brings concentrated flavors of watermelon and raspberries, with all the freshness of the newest vintage. It's bright and focused, the very picture of what is most exciting about these seasonal Northwest rosés."
US,92,30,Syrah,red,DeTierra Vineyards 2013 Mesa Del Sol Syrah (Arroyo Seco),"Squeezed boysenberry, smoked beef, thyme, lavender and even rosemary show on the nose of this fresh and smoky bottling from a lesser-known appellation. The savory qualities invade the palate, where dried herbs, soy and smoked meat hang on a backbone of dense berry fruit and slightly chunky tannins, finishing with crushed mint."
US,86,30,Pinot Noir,red,Red Tail Ridge 2009 Estate Bubbles Sparkling Rosé Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),"Earthy mushroom, yeast and spice notes accent aromas of preserved red fruits on this exuberantly foamy sparkler. It's penetrating on the palate with tart cranberry acidity, and finishes with a lingering hint of dried leaves."
France,86,19,Pinot Noir,red,Simonnet-Febvre 2008 Epineuil  (Bourgogne),Epineuil is a small area close to Chablis. This red wine is as light and fresh as its northerly location would suggest. Red cherry juice dominates an attractively textured wine that could be served slightly chilled.
US,89,36,Syrah,red,Coeur d'Alene 2006 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Syrah (Washington),"The structure of this Syrah, from a vineyard in the Royal Slope, is impressive. It's a balanced blend of flavors, with juicy raspberry and blackberry fruit, black olive, pepper and spice."
US,85,24,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Standing Stone 2007 Pinnacle Red (Finger Lakes),"A medium-bodied Bordeaux blend with sweet aromas of cherry pie and a hint of fresh sage and tarragon. Simple and straightforward with a ripe, red cherry palate, it's a touch soft with a slight green undertone, but there's nice bright acidity and soft tannins that carry through the finish."
France,92,23,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château du Taillan 2015  Haut-Médoc,"Leaving Bordeaux for the Médoc, this is the first estate along the road. The wine is structured and firm, with some solid tannins as well as generous blackberry fruit. The wood aging and spice balance the blueberry and blackberry fruits. The wine should age well; drink from 2021."
US,90,28,Chardonnay,white,Lundeen 2012 Dennison Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Barrel-fermented in neutral oak, this is a ripe, creamy wine with mix of pineapple and buttered nuts. The secondary fermentation was stopped at 50%, leaving generous acidity and balancing out the intensity of the fruit. This wine punches above its price weight, and will drink well now through 2020."
US,88,60,Pinot Noir,red,Walt 2011 Gap's Crown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Exceptionally fruity in raspberries and cherries, this Pinot shows finely-ground tannins that give it a distinguished texture. It's so forward in flavor that it may not be an ager, so drink up over the next three years."
US,88,43,Pinot Noir,red,The Mountain Winery 2012 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Intriguingly unique scents and flavors highlight this wine from the estate started more than a century ago by the legendary Paul Masson. Aromas of pomegranate juice, sour plum and elderberry jam meet with juniper, wet tobacco and spearmint on the nose. The palate packs black plum and blackberries with rose hips, black tea and more tobacco."
US,86,18,White Blend,white,Adamant Cellars 2007 Bliss White Wine White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a juicy, fruity white blend, with more than a hint of honeyed sweetness. Ripe fruit captures flavors of peach flesh and skin, along with tropical suggestions of guava and papaya. In short, this is not your typical, grassy, herbaceous style of Sauv Blanc/Sémillon. I'd serve it as an aperitif, well-chilled."
US,84,14,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Lovingston 2008 Rotunda Red Red (Monticello),"Lovingston's medium-bodied Bordeaux Blend is pleasantly grapy on the nose with an undertone of darkly toasted oak, nuts and savory spices. The palate holds a decent amount of black fruit, but with a green, underripe vein and fairly high level of acidity and tannins."
US,89,13,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Geyser Peak 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Dry and smoothly tannic, this wine is packed with complex blackberry-pie, currant, anise, herb and cedar flavors. This is nearly as good as the winery's more costly Walking Tree Vineyard Block Collection Cabernet, but it's just a little less concentrated."
US,91,52,Chardonnay,white,Pride Mountain 2015 Vintner Select Cuvée Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"Oaky toast and salty, firm acidity give this wine a flavor profile of lemon, apple and dried herb that's lengthy and full of complexity. Medium bodied, it finds balance between fruit flavors and a savory edge, remaining bright and rich on the palate."
US,84,25,Sauvignon Blanc,white,In Re 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),"Sweet and soft in vanilla, buttered toast, golden apricot and lemon honey flavors. Turns cloying after a sip or two."
France,85,24,Chardonnay,white,Chanson Père et Fils 2013  Mâcon La Roche Vineuse,"This wine offers fresh lemon and a lightly creamy fruitiness. It is floral in character with attractive acidity. Fruity, with a crisp citrus tang at the end, it is ready to drink."
US,82,20,Red Blend,red,Bota Box 2011 RedVolution Red (California),"Costing the equivalent of $5 for one 750-ml bottle, this is made in a country style, with a jagged mouthfeel and berry flavors that are tinged with green mint and chlorophyll."
US,92,33,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cooper-Garrod 2009 Lone Oak Vineyard Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Lightly toasted tobacco, blueberry pie and cedar scents lead the way on this single-vineyard Cab. Fresh blueberry on the palate combines with a great arc of flavors that ends in a chewed cigar finish."
US,91,38,Syrah,red,Mark Moretti 2007 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Earns high praise for its deep, complex flavors that suggest fully ripened grapes, well-treated by the winemaker. Waves of blackberries, cherries, herbs, violets, pepper and spices flood the palate, leading to a long, rich, tannic finish. Best opened soon for its freshness."
US,86,16,Pinot Gris,white,Winter's Hill 2015 Watershed Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills),"One of a trio of Pinot Gris offered in this vintage, this has a yeasty beery character. It falls into a generic white wine style, refreshing enough for a warm day's glug, with that yeasty tang reminiscent of a good cold brew. There is not much in the way of varietal expression though, just a bit of apple and pear fruit coming up in the finish."
US,90,50,Merlot,red,Tarara 2010 CasaNoVA Merlot (Virginia),"The nose is packed with dark notes of desiccated strawberry, red currant and caramel lozenge, plus dried herb and maduro subtleties. Astringent, lip-grabbing tannins bolster the fleshy, medium- to full-bodied palate. A few more years of bottle aging should help mitigate some of the tannic blow, but enjoy it now with a brief decanting and a slab of grilled meat."
US,86,13,Red Blend,red,the Ghost of 413 2010 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"In much the same mold as its companion, the ghost in the machine Red, this is almost all Syrah, with a bit more bite and focus. Purple plum fruit glides smoothly into a lightly toasty finish. A fine every day red with plenty of flavor."
US,84,35,Merlot,red,Stephanie 2006 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A sharp, angular Merlot that's not showing much right now. Totally dry, with thick tannins, it has cherry, coffee, herb and oak flavors. Ready now."
US,90,49,Pinot Noir,red,La Fenêtre 2010 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This is rich and appealing now for its ripe flavors of raspberry and cherry that taste as if they were baked in a sweet, smoky pie crust. The acidity provides a pleasant tartness. It should age well over the next 3–5 years."
US,84,5,Red Blend,red,Mancan NV Red (California),"This wine's intense grapey, jammy aromas lead to very fruity and blackberry jam, melted butter and strawberry syrup flavors. It's medium bodied and sweet."
US,94,54,Pinot Noir,red,Merry Edwards 2010 Flax Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Merry Edwards has had a long relationship with this Westside Road vineyard, which has given her some very great wines. This 2010 continues her offering of delicious Pinots of early appeal, but whose structural integrity guarantees ageability. The wine is lush in raspberries, cherries and currants, yet is elegant and crisp in acidity. You can drink it now, but it will gain in the bottle after 2018."
Italy,83,9,Chardonnay,white,Villa Gianna 2011 Bludigaia Vivace Chardonnay (Lazio),Ripe peach nectar and apricot fuel the rather simple bouquet of this one-dimensional Chardonnay. There's a distant touch of freshness on the otherwise waxy finish.
US,89,45,Pinot Noir,red,Longplay 2011 Lia's Vineyard Hi-Tone Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This cuvée features grapes from some of the vineyard's oldest vines. It's a light, elegant mix of pomegranate and cherry pie flavors with plenty of natural acidity behind it. Cola and dried herb highlights add complexity, and a persistent minerality buoys the finish."
US,86,23,Syrah,red,Lafond 2011 SRH Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),"With ripe, forward cherry, raspberry, cola and toasty oak flavors, this is a Syrah to drink now. The tannins are soft and velvety, and there's just enough acidity for balance."
Italy,89,26,Red Blend,red,Santa Sofia 2011 Antichello  (Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso),"Antichello opens with earthy aromas of underbrush, berry and tobacco with a hint of meat juices. The palate yields delicious black cherry along with notes of mint and nutmeg. It's structured but also fresh and very easy to drink."
US,84,18,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Wheelhouse 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Shows the sweet fruitiness and bite of citrusy acidity of raspberry and cherry jam, a simple Cabernet to drink now."
US,89,16,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Francis Ford Coppola 2015 Diamond Collection Yellow Label Sauvignon Blanc (California),"A fresh, grassy aroma and lively grapefruit and herb flavors give a lot of zest to this medium-bodied and almost peppery wine."
US,86,40,Merlot,red,Miner 2005 Stagecoach Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"Ripe and dry, with smooth flavors of cherries, violets, plum sauce, carob and spice. But turns bitter and sharp toward the finish, with an espresso scour."
US,90,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Brander 2015 Coquelicot Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc,"The nose on this bottling from longtime Sauv Blanc proponent Fred Brander and winemaker Fabian Bravo is light and delicate, with dried apricot and wet hay aromas, but also tangy, with fresh-cut tangerines. The acidity is evened out on the sip, making for a subtle and pleasant experience full of dried grass, light citrus and Granny Smith apple skin flavors."
Italy,86,70,Sangiovese,red,Scopone 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,"Aromas of oak take the forefront, with ripe plum, roasted coffee bean, smoke and meat juices in the background. The palate offers dark berry layered with oak sensations alongside astringent wood tannins. It has an excruciatingly dry finish. Superior Wines, Siema."
France,92,42,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Pascal Jolivet 2010 Le Chêne Marchand  (Sancerre),"The steep south-facing Chêne Marchand vineyard provides fruit for this very concentrated and impressive wine. Its weight doesn't come from richness, but rather a powerful structure that underpins a mineral tang and intense freshness."
Italy,87,50,Red Blend,red,Farina 2011  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"Black currant, cedar, prune, spice and just a whiff of barnyard lead the nose on this young Amarone. The dense palate delivers baked plum, stewed prune, nutmeg and clove alongside tightly-knit, bracing tannins. It finishes on an astringent note."
US,92,36,Pinot Noir,red,Colene Clemens 2012 Margo Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Bright and spicy, this wine makes an immediate impact. The blueberry fruit has a sassy edge, and it penetrates through the middle into a finish with notes of black licorice, baking spices and coffee grounds. Firm, full and tight, the wine should age nicely now through 2025."
France,82,18,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Les Gravières de la Brandille 2011  Bordeaux Supérieur,"The unfocused wine tastes soapy, with bitterness and little fruit. Not a wine to enjoy now or in the future."
US,81,7,Pinot Noir,red,Monterey Vineyard 1999 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"It’s got a good color, a pretty ruby, and the aromas suggest sun-dried tomatoes, beetroot, and just the faintest hint of cherry, with sweeter, vanilla-accented notes. Very soft, with low acidity and raspberry-cherry fruit flavors."
France,90,16,Red Blend,red,Château Lecusse 2006 Vieilli en Fût de Chêne Red (Gaillac),"Mint flavors showcase the new wood used to age this wine. That wood balances well with the ripe, full, berry flavors and solid fruit tannins, yielding a structured and impressive wine worth aging over at least four years."
US,85,15,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Manifesto! 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Aromas are floral and fruity, but also oaky, while flavors add ripe plum and black cherry jazzed up with vanilla accents. This is medium bodied, not very tannic, but packs a good amount of flavor."
France,89,35,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,J.V. Fleury 2009 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"This is rather fresh in style for a 2009 from the Southern Rhône, with bold cherry and chocolate notes, reasonably crisp acids and softly dusty tannins. That said, it's a mouth-filling wine, but one that's harmonious and easy to drink."
Italy,88,26,Sangiovese,red,Podere San Cristoforo 2014 Carandelle  (Maremma Toscana),"Aromas of blue flower, red berry, baking spice and toasted oak lead the nose. Made entirely with Sangiovese, the bright palate offers red cherry, raspberry and a hint of cinnamon alongside polished tannins."
US,89,22,Chardonnay,white,Kendall-Jackson 2014 Grand Reserve Chardonnay (Central Coast),"Straw yellow in color, this widely available wine offers vanilla, lemon curd, honeysuckle and a touch of browned butter on the nose. Once sipped, seared lemon and yellow apple show first, settling into a vanilla cream groove and finishing on a touch of marshmallow."
US,87,18,Pinot Gris,white,Portlandia 2015 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Just out, this is quite young and tart, tightly wound with green apple and green pear fruit. It's the sort of wine that may well improve considerably with an extra year in bottle. A light touch of cinnamon comes up in the aftertaste."
US,85,18,Riesling,white,Claiborne & Churchill 2007 Dry Riesling (Central Coast),"Shows some Riesling character in the petrol, honeysuckle and citrus fruit aromas and flavors, and that crisp Central Coast acidity makes it very bright and clean. It's a bit thin, but nice enough as an apéritif sipper."
France,88,13,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Haut le Valette 2015 Cuvée Caractères  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"A ripe and spicy wine, this is structured with black-currant fruits and lively acidity. It is still very young: its exuberant fruitiness likely to calm as it matures. Give this ripe wine until 2019."
US,91,42,Pinot Noir,red,Gallegos 2013 Boekenoogen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Enticing plum and baked-strawberry aromas invite the nose on this bottling, as do sandalwood, cola and nutmeg notes. The palate begins with soft cranberry and then dives into oregano and thyme before moving into more restrained gravel flavors, finishing with juniper and pine needles. This wine's wound-up structure will unfurl nicely with time."
France,87,22,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Haut-Mévret 2016  Côtes de Bourg,"The young, berry fruit in this wine is bright, scintillating with acidity and black currant crispness. It's structured and young, but the fruitiness will allow it to age quickly. Drink from 2019."
US,90,48,Pinot Noir,red,Gainey 2007 Limited Selection Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Very rich and ripe, with masses of cherries, red currants and mocha that finish thoroughly dry and spicy. Full-bodied, too, almost like Grenache. Quite good, but a bit ungainly in youth. Needs a few years in the bottle. 2010–2013."
US,88,24,Chardonnay,white,Left Coast Cellars 2012 Truffle Hill Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Half of this wine was barrel fermented in mostly new French oak; the other half done in stainless. Peaches and butter are the main flavors, with a soft, pretty finish that brings a streak of caramel."
US,90,35,Syrah,red,K Vintners 2010 M.C.K. Syrah (Washington),"M.C.K. stands for Motor City Kitty, and along with the winery's Milbrandt Syrah, this is the entry-level offering in a vast portfolio of single vineyard bottlings. Tasty, toasty, supple and fruity, this carries slight hints of citrus, earth and stem and wraps its appealing, forward flavors in a light coating of milk chocolate."
US,86,28,White Blend,white,Ballentine 2016 Maple Station Estate Grown White (Napa Valley),"This combines Chardonnay, Malvasia Bianca, Sauvignon Blanc and Chenin Blanc in nearly equal parts. A sweet, floral nose of honeysuckle dominates before apricot jam and vanilla flavors enter the scene. Thick and concentrated, it finishes with a dry, crisp lemon note."
US,90,75,Red Blend,red,DeLille 2007 Harrison Hill Red (Snipes Mountain),"From a single vineyard on Snipes Mountain, this is a forceful, dark and liquorous version of Harrison Hill, which often carries more herbal accents. Here it's fruity and floral, with scents of rose petals and concentrated raspberry and cassis. Still young and showing its alcohol, it needs some hours of decanting."
France,89,30,Pinot Noir,red,Château de Santenay 2014 Clos Philippe le Hardi  (Hautes Cotes de Beaune),"Philip the Bold was Duke of Burgundy in the 14th century and owner of this estate. This wine that comes from vines next to Saint-Aubin is cool and fresh, emphasizing red currants and acidity. It needs to broaden out, which will happen in the next two to three years. Drink from 2019."
US,89,45,Pinot Noir,red,Cuvaison 2006 Block F5 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"The F5 bottling is proving to be a good one for Cuvaison. While the '06 doesn't have the structural complexity of the '05, it's a very fine Pinot Noir. With a silky texture and a furry edge of fine tannins, its cherry, black raspberry, red currant, mocha and spice flavors are complex and pleasing. Best now through 2012."
US,88,90,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Sequoia Grove 2012 Henry Brothers Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Softened by 20% Merlot, and aged in a healthy majority of new French oak, this is a smoky, smooth and tannic wine with savory characteristics of pencil and cedar that outweigh the fruitier aspects of mountain blackberry."
US,92,48,Pinot Noir,red,Kosta Browne 2000 Cohn Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Rich and ripe on the palate. Plush and full, brimming with plum, cherry, chocolate, spice, herb and vanilla flavors. Lively and long on the finish. A real treat."
US,93,60,Syrah,red,Hard Six Cellars 2014 Seven Pillars Jess' Block Syrah (Fort Ross-Seaview),"The first vintage of this small-production wine, this is meaty, full of smoky pepper and dense red and blue fruit. It's powerfully built and structured, packing a finishing punch of roasted coffee and chocolate flavors. A worthwhile new discovery and a producer to watch."
US,91,68,Pinot Noir,red,Inman Family 2012 OGV Estate Blanc de Noir Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is made from 100% Pinot Noir and spent three years on the yeast, made in a traditional style. It satisfies in aromas of hazelnut liqueur, mushroom and almond, offering a light, bright and elegant experience. Bright acidity keeps it fresh in the glass, while a tartness of green apple and cherry play against its intense minerality."
US,89,20,Zinfandel,red,Angel Vine 2011 Stonetree Vineyard Zinfandel (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Despite its high alcohol, this high-toned Zin does not have the crushing weight and overall power you'd anticipate. Cranberry and raspberry juice fruit flavors carry balancing acidity, and there's a suggestion of refreshing minerality. Although at first the wine seems disjointed, it smoothes out nicely with aeration."
US,83,22,Zinfandel,red,Clos du Bois 2005 Sonoma Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Hot in alcohol, dry and thin in fruit, this Zin shows very modest blackberry, cherry and spice flavors. Finishes with a scour of sticky tannins."
Italy,87,15,Sangiovese,red,Castelli del Grevepesa 2012 Castelgreve  (Chianti Classico),"Aromas of violet, ripe plum and a whiff of espresso lead the nose of this straightforward red. The easygoing palate offers dried cherry, crushed raspberry and a hint of ground pepper alongside fresh acidity and dusty, rather fleeting tannins."
France,88,40,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château d'Armailhac 2007  Pauillac,"Soft, juicy and fruity, relatively light in character. The tannins are fresh, supporting black currant and fresh, juicy fruit flavors. It's easy and open, developing well, but quickly."
US,85,32,Zinfandel,red,Musetta 2007 St. Peter's Church Selection Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A sound, pleasant Zinfandel with a good array of wild berry, cherry, anise, herb and white pepper flavors. The flavors are quite complex, but the wine is a little sharp and edgy in tannins, with some green notes."
US,90,30,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Kelleher 2015 Block 21 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This is a creamy, lushly textured white that's medium bodied and ample on the palate, with accents of well-integrated pear, vanilla and fennel flavors."
US,82,35,Zinfandel,red,Sterling 2013 Cellar Club Zinfandel (Calistoga),"A burnt, reduced quality mars the fruit in this wine, made in a big style with full-bodied power and density."
US,94,30,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Galerie 2016 Naissance Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This producer continues to up its game with this variety, becoming more impressive with every vintage. With the majority stainless-steel fermented, it offers tart, tangy grapefruit pith, lemon and lime around a grip of sublime texture and length."
US,95,100,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Janzen 2010 Beckstoffer Missouri Hopper Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"This is always one of Janzen's best bottlings, courtesy of one of the jewels in the Beckstoffer crown of vineyards. The 2010 is softly tannic and enormously rich, showing wave after wave of blackberry essence, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and anise notes, with a firm minerality. It's beautiful now, but try to keep your hands off it until at least 2018."
US,88,25,Zinfandel,red,Paul Dolan 2010 Zinfandel (Mendocino County),"Paul Dolan Zin remains big with savory flavors beef jerky, roast meat and black pepper. Not overdone in alcohol or tannin, its a perfect go-to for nights around the grill and will please a crowd."
US,85,9,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Washington Hills 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Washington),"Light aromas of pineapple and other tropical fruit are accented by herb, floral and citrus flavors. The concentration is very light."
US,89,55,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Casa Nuestra 2005 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Made in a lighter, slightly more rustic and less ripe manner, with herb-infused black currant and licorice flavors. A vigorous young 100% Cab elaborated with plenty of new oak. Drink now through 2013."
US,89,45,Pinot Noir,red,Patz & Hall 2011 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Shows good Sonoma Coast character in the tart acids and cool-climate flavors of pomegranates, cherries and cola. Lots of new French oak adds rich notes of buttered toast and smoke. Appealingly dry, it's a fancy, elegant wine from this fine producer, but finishes a little short. Drink over the next 2–3 years."
US,86,39,Chardonnay,white,Patz & Hall 2005 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Patz & Hall has captured the cool-climate essence of southern Sonoma Chard with this dry, crisply acidic, and vibrantly fruity young wine. Might have benefitted from less new oak though, because the caramel and toast seem a little excessive."
US,86,18,Zinfandel,red,Plungerhead 2014 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Bacon fat, smoked meat and caramelized onions initially come to mind in this rich, robust red, blended with the tiniest amount of Merlot. Blackberry jam, tar, gunpowder and black pepper characterize the mix of savory with ripe, while the tannin profile remains soft."
US,87,36,Zinfandel,red,Peachy Canyon 2008 Mustang Springs Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"A bit hot in high alcohol, with a chili pepper bite behind the enormously ripe raspberry and cherry jam, chocolate, beef jerky and pepper spice flavors. Drink now."
US,95,100,Chardonnay,white,Freestone 2007 Pastorale Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"A massively constructed Chardonnay that's opulent and concentrated and bursts in the mouth with pineapple, lemon drop candy, Asian pear and white peach flavors of enormous ripeness. The entire production of 108 cases was aged in new oak, so there's a lavish veneer of sweet, smoky buttered toast. Sur lie aging is evident in the creaminess and ever so slight sourdough tartness that adds a piquant touch. This impressive Chard is at its best now in its flashy, flamboyant youth."
France,91,30,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Vignobles Berthier 2013 Terre de Marne Sauvignon Blanc (Coteaux du Giennois),"This is part of the range of three wines from different soils. Marne, or clay and chalk soil, is relatively heavy and produces a rich style of Sauvignon Blanc. This brings out the more tropical fruits and ripe pineapple that dominate the youthful acidity that cuts through the texture. Drink from 2016."
France,84,19,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Le Prince 2012 Vieilles Vignes Red (Côtes du Rhône),"This blend of 54% Grenache, 34% Syrah, 9% Mourvèdre and 3% Cinsault boasts some brambly fruit, but that's dominated by notes of leather and clove. It shows decent weight and concentration on the palate, but just a bit rustic overall."
Italy,89,20,Sangiovese,red,Castello di Bossi 2010  Chianti Classico,"Sangiovese from the Castelnuovo Berardenga area of Chianti Classico benefits from slightly warmer temperatures on average. That extra heat shapes a full and generous quality of fruit that is ripe with blackberry, prune and plum. There's a touch of earthy clay and tobacco at the back."
US,92,18,Syrah,red,Bianchi 2013 Signature Selection Syrah (Paso Robles),"Caramelized black plum, teriyaki, pepper and graphite scents combine for a rich, nuanced and inviting nose on this bottling. There is beefy depth to the palate, suggesting roasted meat, hoisin sauce, plum, dried herbs and peppercorn, all unfolding in layers."
US,93,135,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,D.R. Stephens 2014 Walther River Block Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Minty cedar rides atop an expansive succulence in this estate wine that impresses in its ability to support grippy tannin and generous fruit. Blackberry and coffee highlight the flavor spectrum, reaching dark, brooding length on the finish."
US,83,24,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Somerston 2009 Priest Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Dull and thin, with watered-down peach and citrus flavors. No much going on in this Sauvignon Blanc."
US,92,45,Zinfandel,red,De Loach 2012 Saitone Vineyard Olivet Bench Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Saitone is a supremely historic vineyard, planted originally in 1895 in the thick of the Russian River Valley's Olivet Bench, a coveted spot these days for Pinot Noir. The wine offers supple, soft tannins around a juicy intensity of grenadine and berry crumble. The structured backbone of minerality is remarkable."
US,91,25,Red Blend,red,Blue Rock 2009 Baby Blue Red (Alexander Valley),"A lovely wine, drinkable now and over the next few years. Made from Merlot, the two Cabernets and a dash of Syrah, it's rich and lush in blackberry, blueberry, cured meat, black pepper and cedar flavors, wrapped into smooth, spicy tannins."
US,95,35,Chardonnay,white,Shea 2013 Shea Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Here is an utterly irresistible wine—spicy, sensuous and layered with beautifully ripened citrus, tree and tropical fruits. A whiff of pine needle continues as a flavor thread, along with vanilla, buttered nuts, lemongrass and macaroon. This wine just keeps on going."
US,86,18,Chardonnay,white,Robert Hall 2014 Chardonnay (Paso Robles),"Quite ripe in style, this wine packs a bevy of white flower aromas, from jasmine to tuberose, as well as fleshy yellow pears. There is solid sizzle in the glass once sipped, but the honeysuckle prominence, ripe peach and powerful orange-blossom flavors dominate."
US,82,30,Chardonnay,white,Cru 2008 Appellation Series Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),"Very tart, almost sour in acidity, with unnaturally sweet pineapple, buttered toast and caramel flavors."
US,90,30,Merlot,red,Crane Brothers 2005 Crane Ranch Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"Here's a strongly flavored Merlot, made with ultraripe fruit. If it didn't have a good structure, the blackberry, currant, mocha and anise flavors alone would make it a fruit bomb. Fortunately, fine acidity and gorgeously thick tannins give it structure and backbone. Best for a year or two."
Italy,93,67,Red Blend,red,Musella 2010 Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella),"Crushed iris, baked plum, cedar, tobacco and new leather aromas seamlessly come together on this bold full-bodied red. Smooth and ripe, the full-bodied palate doles out mature black cherry, raspberry jam, licorice and mocha framed in well-knit, velvety tannins. Drink 2018 through 2026."
US,87,33,Chardonnay,white,Fullerton 2015 Five Faces Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Still a bit fragmented, this offers a core of tight apple and peach fruit. It was barrel fermented (10% new) and that shell of barrel flavors has not yet smoothed into the fruit. Give it brisk aeration or another year in the bottle."
US,93,34,Zinfandel,red,Harney Lane 2014 Scottsdale Vineyard Zinfandel (Lodi),"This distinctive, complex and layered wine brings a unique aromatic profile of raspberries, sage and spice before fanning out across the palate with gorgeous raspberry syrup, dark chocolate and blackberry flavors. Its lightly grippy texture of fine-grained tannins perfectly counters the plush effusiveness of its fruit."
Italy,87,22,Sangiovese,red,Val di Suga 2012  Rosso di Montalcino,"This full-bodied but informal wine has sensations of leafy forest floor, mature black cherry, prune and tobacco alongside firm tannins. It's straightforward with a warm midpalate and shy on fresh acidity so enjoy it soon."
US,90,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Clos Pegase 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Tight red fruit and a solid whack of oak make for a fine wine. Tobacco mingles with coffee on the otherwise black-cherry and curranty palate. It's definitely clean and polished, and will drink well for the next three to five years."
France,90,60,Chardonnay,white,Château de Bligny NV Brut Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (Champagne),"While the Aube vineyards are dominated by Pinot Noir, this wine shows that the region can also produce steely, mineral-driven Chardonnay. This is a fresh wine, crisp and full of tangy citrus as well as fresh green apple flavors. It could be an apéritif wine but it will work best with food."
US,92,29,Pinot Noir,red,Balletto 2011 Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"An exceptionally good Pinot, from a winery that frequently gets overlooked, perhaps because they're not charging an arm and a leg. The wine is light and silky in the mouth, with alcohol well under 14%, and marked with crisp acidity and fine-grained tannins. The flavors are classic pomegranates, rhubarbs and black cherries. Should develop over the next 4–6 years. What a great value."
US,92,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Provenance Vineyards 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"This beautiful Bordeaux blend is based mostly on Cabernet Sauvignon. It's likeable now for the soft, refined texture and luscious flavors of tart cherry candy, accented with nearly half new oak. Shows real balance and flair, from a winery known for objective pricing. Now–2013."
US,88,44,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Efeste 2011 Nana Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of Red Willow Merlot (61%) and Angela's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine offers savory aromas of herbs, nori and peanut shells. The palate shows good concentration to the sweet coffee and cherry flavors that display a supple feel and are backed by lightly chewy tannins."
US,87,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Storm 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"This Sauvignon Blanc has so much acidity, it's almost sparkling. While not unpleasant, this has to be regarded as a fault, which detracts from the score. Aside from that, the citrus, tropical fruit, honey and gooseberry flavors are delicious."
US,89,16,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Ross Andrew 2014 The Huntsman Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"There's no mistaking the variety, with its generous notes of herb, cherry and blueberry. The flavors are full and lush and full, with lightly grainy tannins backing them up."
US,90,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Tempus Cellars 2014 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (40%), Merlot (35%) and Cabernet Franc comes from Bacchus, Dionysus, Weinbau and Seven Hills vineyards—some of the top vineyards in the state. Dark roasted coffee bean, char, herb and cherry aromas lead to restrained fruit and barrel flavors that show a fine sense of elegance. It delivers a lot of quality and value."
France,90,40,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Glorit 2014  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"The wine from Denis Coudroy's 10 acres of vines is perfumed from new wood, with a polished character and bright fruit flavors. Underneath the wood, there is plenty of black-currant juiciness and fresh acidity. Drink this attractive wine from 2019."
Italy,92,43,Red Blend,red,Caparzo 2010 Cà del Pazzo Red (Toscana),"A 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of cedar, violet, underbrush and dark berry. The elegantly structured palate delivers black cherries, red currants, black pepper and anise alongside smooth, integrated tannins. Drink through 2018."
US,94,47,Pinot Noir,red,Matrix 2009 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Extraordinarily delicious. Earns its reserve citation for the sheer power and audacity of fruit. Masses of ripe raspberry and cherry tart, vanilla and cola flavors dazzle the palate. The all-important tannins are softly refined, and the acids are crisp. Designed to dazzle now, and does, but should gain traction and age in interesting ways over the next six years."
US,91,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Kirkland Signature 2011 Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"This is a good price for a Cabernet this rich and satisfying. It's dry, tannic and opulent in blackberries, black currants and mocha, with a complex note of green olives. It's fully ready to drink now."
US,93,55,Chardonnay,white,Lynmar 2013 Susanna's Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"This vineyard designate is consistently richer and rounder than many of the other whites made by the producer, a mix of thick and concentrated barrel influence and savory-sweet fruit and spice. Full bodied, it offers a curiously compelling briny edge, decadent yet bright."
US,88,25,Syrah,red,"Quady North 2012 4-2,A Syrah (Rogue Valley)","Though it's relatively light for Syrah, this offers flavors that are true to classic varietal characteristics. Red and purple berries, anise and a vein of steel are all in the mix, and continue through a gentle fade-out."
Italy,88,90,Sangiovese,red,Lambardi 2011  Brunello di Montalcino,"Earthy aromas of game, porcini mushroom, scorched earth, saline and crushed herb meld together on this. The taut palate offers raw red berry, mineral and grilled sage alongside austere tannins. Drink 2018–2023."
France,88,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Faizeau 2012 Sélection Vieilles Vignes  (Montagne-Saint-Émilion),"This ripe, concentrated wine brings out the fruit of the vintage, ripe blackberries and currants. Tannins integrate well into the fruity character of the wine. Black cherry acidity comes through strongly at the end."
US,92,30,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Lancaster 2013 Samantha's Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley),"Flinty and austere, this is an elegant white wine crafted from 100% Musque clone, dancing in pear and grapefruit. The layered texture impressively stands out, riding the wave between creamy and lemony crisp with precision, opening the door for the wine to finish refreshingly."
Italy,86,40,Red Blend,red,Le Grascete 2004 Le Grascete  (Bolgheri),"Paolo Valagussa's Cabernet Sauvignon-Sangiovese-Merlot blend is characterized by green notes of artichoke leaf, garden greens and pungent green peppercorn. It has tight, polished tannins and definitely needs to rest a few more years in the bottle."
Italy,84,14,Red Blend,red,La Canosa 2011 Nummaria  (Rosso Piceno Superiore),This blend of 70% Montepulciano and 30% Sangiovese opens with aromas of prune and mocha that carry over to the palate. It lacks fruit richness and freshness and it's easy to detect evident alcohol.
France,92,56,Chardonnay,white,Pierre Gimonnet et Fils NV Cuis Premier Cru Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"Fresh apples and cream aromas with a tight citrus and mineral edge. The fruit is fresh but, with the attractive ripeness of white currants. Very full in the mouth, very much a wine, suggesting an ability to go with food."
US,87,20,Riesling,white,Heron Hill 2011 Ingle Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Spice notes accent pressed-apple aromas on this semidry Riesling. The palate is juicy and penetrating with flavors of quince jelly and elegant notes of peach and blossom. Finishes vibrantly, with a zippy lemon-honey note."
US,89,62,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Robinson Family Vineyards 2010 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"A soft, creamy texture houses buttery flavors of blackberry jam and mocha in this Cab, which has a drop of Merlot. It's flashy and opulent, in the modern Napa style, with relatively high alcohol that gives a bite of heat. Drink it over the next six years."
US,87,25,Chardonnay,white,Veramar 2015 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Virginia),"This wine is nutty on the nose, with faint hints of lemon, vanilla and ghee. More fruit comes through on the palate, boasting lemon, apple and pineapple, with nuts and chamomile adding depth. This straight-forward and balanced wine has a long and harmonious finish."
France,87,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Franc-Cardinal 2010  Francs Côtes de Bordeaux,"A rich but structured wine, this shows dark fruits and a strong tannic core. There is fine acidity and a taut, mineral texture."
France,90,29,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Laffitte Laujac 2010  Médoc,"A finely made wine, full of firm tannins and rich fruit. Structured and dark, it has weight, black fruit and great potential. With wood aging smoothing the bold fruit, it can be drunk soon, but will age well. Drink from 2014."
US,90,70,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Las Positas 2013 Estate Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"This wine has a dark color, classic cedar and black currant aromas, ripe fruit flavors and firm tannins along with raspberry-like acidity. It has been well-sculpted with barrel age—polishing any rough tannic edges—and will taste great with a thick steak or chop."
US,90,52,Pinot Noir,red,Heart O' The Mountain 2008 Triple Seven Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"A big Pinot Noir, darkly colored and full-bodied in the mouth. The depth of fruit is impressive, packing a solid core of black cherries and plums. Might gain some bottle notes over the next 4–6 years."
France,87,20,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Puygueraud 2014  Francs Côtes de Bordeaux,"Smooth and creamy in texture, this rounded wine is cut easily by acidity, with a tangy background that gives a more mineral edge. With its fresh aftertaste, this is ready to drink. In the Thienpont family since 1946, Nicolas has been the winemaker and a key mover in this appellation since 1983."
US,91,50,Red Blend,red,Seven Hills 2005 Pentad Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Subtle and soft, this aromatic Bordeaux blend (54% Cab Sauvignon, 9% Carmenère, 9% Merlot, 10% Malbec, 18% Petit Verdot) is laced with herb and exotic and savory spices, woven through tight fruit flavors of blueberry and musky grape. This is a delicate, evocative and challenging wine that rewards your attention. Fascinating and complex, it needs time to breathe and good glassware to really open up."
US,86,32,Syrah,red,Lawer 2013 Betsy's Vineyard Syrah (Knights Valley),"Dark, black and leathery, this wine has an Old-World spirit and rusticity, a dearth of fruit under smooth, thick and dense tannins as well as oak."
US,91,23,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Harmony Cellars 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Numerous lively aromas kick off this bottling, from black currant and purple flower to savory smoke and black peppercorn. The palate is framed by buoyant acidity and chalky tannins, which hold up rich black cherry, clove, licorice and mocha flavors."
US,88,35,Chardonnay,white,C'est Bon 2013 Reserve Selection Chardonnay (Oakville),"Waxy apple and lemon pith open this wine, followed by crisp, candied grapefruit. Robust, it finishes dry and balanced. The whole sums up into a full-bodied, rich and lush experience."
France,88,25,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Tour des Gendres 2010 Cuvée des Conti White (Bergerac Sec),"The dominance of young Sémillon in the blend gives considerable herbaceousness. The wine has a fresh, grassy character, its acidity offering freshness within the full texture."
US,82,11,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Alias 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (California),Earthy and dried-herb aromas are followed by thin herbaceous flavors like celery and cucumber in this light-bodied wine. The texture is soft and watery.
US,88,16,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Buttonwood 2013 Signature Blend Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"Just-squeezed lime mixes with soda for a light, refreshing aroma on this wine from the longtime Sauv Blanc producer in the middle of the Santa Ynez Valley. The palate is all citrus, with lime sorbet and lemon-pith flavors."
US,91,25,Pinot Noir,red,Laetitia 2013 Estate Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Quite ripe raspberry juice, cola, roses and violet candy shows on the nose of this wine from the veteran producer along Highway 101 in southern San Luis Obispo County. The palate offers root beer, cola, cream soda, chocolate-covered cherries and cappuccino elements."
US,87,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,TruthTeller 2014 Wisdom Red (Yakima Valley),"Cabernet Sauvignon (57%) takes the lead on this wine, with the balance Merlot (19%), Cabernet Franc (19%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of plum, vanilla and herb, along with a touch of cocoa powder lead to lightly styled fruit and barrel flavors."
US,84,20,Pinot Gris,white,Pollak 2012 Estate Grown Pinot Gris (Monticello),"This Pinot Gris has aromas of wax, red apple, underripe white peach and citrus. The white peach note becomes more dominant on the easygoing palate, and it leads to a mineral-like tang that lingers onto the slightly yeasty finish."
US,91,36,Chardonnay,white,Maple Creek 2007 Estate Chardonnay (Yorkville Highlands),"Achieves the difficult feat of tasting sweet but finishing dry. The pineapple custard, peach pie and butterscotch flavors are impossible to resist, yet the wine firms up on the finish, with a scour of dry acidity."
US,81,9,Pinot Grigio,white,Surf Point 2007 Pinot Grigio (California),"Dry and crisp, but so watered down, there's practically nothing there. Shows the barest hint of of citrus and flower flavors."
US,90,15,White Blend,white,Thurston Wolfe 2011 PGV White (Washington),"Bright, fresh and fruity, this is loaded with citrus—especially grapefruit—goodness. There are layers of pears and peaches, making this a big, fruity, mouth-filling wine."
US,88,22,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Firestone 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"Blueberry, vanilla and caramel pop on the nose of this wine from the pioneering brand that is now owned by Bill Foley. Soft yet dense tannins and a plush mouthfeel ensue once sipped, with elderberry, bay leaf and fresh herbs showing on the tightly structured palate."
US,87,7,Merlot,red,Ste. Chapelle 2000 Value Series Merlot (Idaho),"Idaho and Merlot are not thoughts that generally spring together in the mind of the wine consumer, but Ste. Chapelle makes a good run at crafting an attractive, perfectly balanced wine here. The fruit is cherry and lightly herbal, and there are interesting flavors of earth and mocha, too. Best Buy. —P.G."
US,88,12,Pinot Grigio,white,Mirassou 2015 Pinot Grigio (California),"Smoothness and subtlety come with a texture just rich enough to be interesting, without damping down the acidity that makes this light-bodied wine refreshing. It offers flavors of crisp green apple and a touch of pear."
Italy,84,7,Pinot Grigio,white,Kirkland Signature 2010 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Grave),"You can't beat this price for a Pinot Grigio with natural freshness and pristine aromas of stone fruit and citrus. The nice thing is that it tastes Italian made, and not like many of the commercial, generic Grigios on the market today."
US,87,18,Chardonnay,white,Buena Vista 2007 Chardonnay (Carneros),"Buena Vista has a good reputation for this bottling, and the great '07 vintage has resulted in another fine Chardonnay, at a good price. Racy in acidity, the wine shows mineral-infused citrus fruit, apple and honeysuckle notes that finish with a touch of off-dry sweetness."
US,89,12,Zinfandel,red,Tortoise Creek 2013 The Chelonian Zinfandel (Lodi),"Attractive sage and fresh-cut wood accents stay with this full-bodied, value-priced wine from the aroma to the finish. Generous, jammy fruit flavors fill in the middle. Extra time soaking with the grape skins helped make it delicious and spicy, mouthfilling and smooth."
Italy,87,19,Red Blend,red,Casa Sola 2013  Chianti Classico,"This easygoing red opens with delicate aromas of violet and red berry. The fresh, easy-drinking palate offers juicy wild cherry and a light note of white pepper alongside pliant tannins and bright acidity. It's made for sheer drinking pleasure so enjoy soon."
US,90,35,Red Blend,red,Reaper 2014 Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"Fat blackberries meet with torn-up asphalt, dust and dark tobacco on the nose of this red blend that is stylishly labeled with the Grim Reaper, but also packs quite a decent wine into the bottle. There is solid acidity and a decent tannic structure to the sip, presenting flavors of black currant and black pepper."
France,85,15,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Pierrail 2016  Bordeaux Blanc,"This wine is tight and young. It will have crisp citrus acidity as it matures, giving a bright, lively wine, refreshing to drink and just right for food."
US,86,33,Pinot Noir,red,Cuvaison 2009 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This Pinot is on the thin side, rather stingy in fruit. But it's dry and crisp and clean enough to be called elegant. Shows modest cherryskin flavors that are generously spiced."
France,90,22,Riesling,white,François Baur 2014 Herrenweg Riesling (Alsace),"Rounded red apple with an edge of peppery spice and a whole lot of grapefruit zest makes for a lively, textured and vivid palate. This is fresh, pure and totally appetizing. The finish similarly leaves the impression of peppery red apples."
US,93,70,Pinot Noir,red,Gary Farrell 2013 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Crisp undercurrents of tangerine, grapefruit and cranberry provide a brightness and light to this wine, which is velvety-smooth on the palate. An inaugural release for the producer from this vineyard, it bristles with cinnamon and clove, delving into black pepper spiciness as well. Drink this structured wine now through 2023."
Italy,87,23,Sangiovese,red,Banfi 1999  Brachetto d'Acqui,"This unique red sparkler from Piedmont offers cherry and earth aromas before turning lighter on the palate, with slightly sweet strawberry flavors and a soft mousse.  Aunique wine, the finish has nice length and appealingly full fruit flavors that have appeal even to serious wine drinkers."
US,95,40,Chardonnay,white,Lynmar 2010 Quail Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A bone dry wine that's rich in steely minerals and wonderful acidity. It offers the elegance and complexity of a great premier cru, with tantalizing traces of sweet Meyer lemons, limes and exotic spices. The oak is subtle, lending aromas and flavors of buttered toast, while its time spent on the lees contributes notes of sour cream. A fabulous success for this or any vintage."
France,97,120,Riesling,white,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Smoke, orange, wet stone and earth notes are powerful and beguiling on the nose. The palate has absolute concentration and energy and more of that smoky promise. This is like the bundled focus of a laser light—incisive, precise and piercing. Notions of peach, lemon and tangerine dance and hover, but the central core and force remains a kind of drive that could move mountains. This is a sleeping giant, absolute and pure, brooding, laying in wait to unleash its might. The palate is absolutely dry, absolutely fresh, absolutely uncompromising. The finish is piercingly clean. Wait for this. Drink 2025–2040 at least."
US,92,26,Zinfandel,red,Madrigal 2005 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"This is a beautiful Zinfandel. It exhibits all the wild, exotic forest berry-cherry flavors you could want, flooded with briary spices and notes of currants and mint that go on forever in the finish. Yet it also has Napa's perfect tannins and the balance of a fine Cabernet Sauvignon. First-class Zin, a chef's dream to play with."
US,97,90,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Napa Angel 2006 by Montes Aurelio's Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"From Chilean winemaker, Aurelio Montes, this 100% Cabernet shows massively concentrated flavors of ripe blackberries and cassis, with richer notes of dark chocolate, anise, spices and smoky cedar. What an amazing tannin structure, intricate, fine and complex. A wine to drink now for sheer opulence or to age for at least a dozen years."
US,91,35,Pinot Noir,red,Clendenen Family 2008 Le Bon Climat Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"While this Pinot has gorgeous, generous raspberry, cola, mushroom and sweet oak flavors, it also possesses a superb structure of tannins and acids that makes it successful. In that sense, it's a masterful balance of power and elegance, and is distinctly Pinot Noir-esque in its silky texture. Drink now–2017, depending on your taste for older Pinot."
US,90,49,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Castello di Amorosa 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec, sourced from throughout the Napa Valley, including the winery's estate Diamond Mountain vineyard. Bold and lush in cranberry and dark chocolate, it's also robust in black pepper and cedar."
US,89,35,Pinot Noir,red,Dion 2010 Winemaker's Reserve Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This is a four-barrel selection—a blend of wines made from four different clones aged in 50% new oak. Cola and cherry-candy flavors carry hints of orange peel and pink grapefruit. It's an elegant wine, a step or two more concentrated than the winery's regular Pinot Noir, with a suggestion of earthy beet root in the finish."
US,91,35,Zinfandel,red,Keating 2012 Buchignani Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Structured in tight red-fruit character, this wine—from a two-acre, dry-farmed vineyard—is floral and nicely adorned in acidity, making for an elegant take on the variety. It is also not overdone in oak, letting the vibrant black cherry and just-picked blackberry dominate."
Italy,88,25,Merlot,red,Cavalli Tenuta degli Dei 2010 Le Redini Merlot (Toscana),"Le Redini is predominantly Merlot, with a small component of Alicante. It opens with notes of bright cherry, leather, tobacco and spice. It shows bold roundness and soft berry nuances on the finish. It's a well-made and elegant wine with an easygoing personality."
US,90,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards 2010 Hidden Block Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"The vast amount of complexity in this makes it a Cabernet Sauvignon on steroids. The acidity is mouthwatering, the tannins are hard, the oak is pronounced and the alcohol is evident. This wine is a fruit orchard in a glass, bursting with ripe blackberries, plums and cherries. The parts haven't begun to knit together, but six years in the cellar will allow them to begin the process."
US,83,7,Zinfandel,red,Coyote Creek 2012 White Zinfandel (California),"With lots of residual sugar, this white Zin is so sweet, it's almost a dessert wine. The sweetness makes the raspberries and cherries taste like candy."
France,89,22,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Vignerons de Buzet 2005 Château de Gueyze Red (Buzet),"Apart from making its own branded wines, the go-ahead Buzet cooperative sells a number of wines from privately-owned estates. This wine is firmly in the tradition of Bordeaux blends, with its dry tannins and firm, licorice and bitter chocolate flavors. It would be worth aging for 2 more years."
US,87,15,Red Blend,red,Waterbrook 2006 Mélange Noir Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Not as forward and lush as the appealing 2005, this all-purpose red, tasted a few months prior to its official release, is still knitting the components together. What is in place is plenty of tart, ripe raspberry fruit, precise and clean, and a soft backdrop of lightly chocolaty tannins."
France,92,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château le Peyrat 2015  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"This wine is finely balanced—an impressive mix of ripe fruit and rich tannins. A smoky character envelops its rich blackberry and plum flavors, all underlined with tannins. It needs to age and will be best from 2020."
France,94,86,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine de Bellene 2014 Les Grèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),"This wine comes from perhaps the most well-known of the many Beaune Premier Crus, from a small parcel of vines that are over 100 years old. It is a rich wine, generous and with a ripe future. At present, the structure and tannins dominate, allowing the wine to have good aging potential. Drink from 2020."
US,82,34,Chardonnay,white,Penns Woods 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Pennsylvania),"This wine starts with a showy nose of vanilla, nuts and oranges/citrus, leading into like flavors with a spin of spice. It's a bigger style Chardonnay that will pair well with richer dishes: think salmon, creamy poultry, steak."
France,92,45,Pinot Gris,white,Rieflé 2010 Zinnkoepflé Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Richly sweet, this is a wine that has traded primary fruitiness with deliciously balanced honey flavor and lively citrus acidity. It's a wine that has richness, intense flavor and the ability to age further."
US,89,38,Zinfandel,red,Peachy Canyon 2013 Bailey Zinfandel (Adelaida District),"A blend of red fruit and dark spice shows on the nose of this wine, with dried strawberry and red cherry running into licorice, purple flowers and black slate. The flavors are broad with cherry candy notes, boosted by a boisterous pepper spice, and settling into a decently tart finish."
US,89,50,Zinfandel,red,Williams Selyem 2008 Feeney Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"So rich and powerful in fruit. Blackberry and cherry jam, mocha, cola, tobacco, black pepper, anise, licorice, beef jerky, it's all there, on steroids."
France,93,50,Pinot Noir,red,Domaines Devillard 2015 Château de Chamirey Clos l'Evêque Premier Cru  (Mercurey),"This is a firm wine that is structured with dense tannins. At the same time, its ripe black fruits and acidity promise a generous rich future. From a walled vineyard, once belonging to the local bishop, the wine is set for some long-term aging. Drink from 2023."
Italy,88,50,Red Blend,red,Albino Armani 2010  Amarone della Valpolicella,"This big simple red opens with aromas of black currant, cedar and a whiff of blue flower. The robust, one-dimensional palate shows raisin, prune and coffee alongside round, velvety tannins."
US,90,24,Chardonnay,white,Talley 2013 Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"In addition to the fig and yellow apple aromas, there's noticeable tropicality on the nose of this wine, but it tightens around tart Meyer lemon pith and crushed ants. Ripe lemons also power the sharp and pithy palate, which offers a shred of roasted almonds and marzipan."
US,87,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,North by Northwest 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Seven Hills and Les Collines provide the grapes for this 80-20 Cab-Merlot blend. The cool 2011 vintage was especially noticeable in Walla Walla—here expressed as light strawberry and cranberry fruit, caught in a shell of acid. The wine ultimately turns tannic, with light barrel flavors of caramel and mocha. More bottle age may help to further meld the components."
Italy,88,50,Sangiovese,red,Belpoggio 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,"Earthy game, truffle, underbrush, used leather and dark-skinned fruit aromas lead the nose. They carry over to the taut, tightly wound palate, where austere, dusty tannins leave a drying finish."
US,90,21,Syrah,red,Hoyt Family Vineyards 2006 Syrah (California),"A good value for a red wine this smooth and flavorful. Shows deep, spicy flavors of blackberries, cherries and bacon, with a beautiful coating of tannin. The grapes come from the Malibu area and from the Santa Ynez Valley."
US,86,15,Red Blend,red,Columbia Crest 2009 H3 Les Chevaux Red Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"A multigrape blend that seems to be lacking focus, this tastes strongly of vanilla and butter cookies, the fruit extremely light."
US,86,32,Red Blend,red,8 Chains North 2010 Furnace Mountain Dry Red (Virginia),"Black plum and cherry aromas pick up an undergrowth hint. This is a succulent, juicy wine with a finish that tastes earthy and feels structured."
France,88,12,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Domaine des Coteaux des Travers 2013 Char à Vin Red (Côtes du Rhône),"This medium-bodied blend of Grenache, Syrah and Carignan delivers just what you'd expect from the appellation, it just does it better than most, at a modest price. Hints of bay leaf and wild thyme accent black cherry fruit and a touch of licorice, while the supple texture features a just slightly astringent finish. Drink now–2018."
US,90,75,Merlot,red,Cornerstone 2012 Oakville Station Merlot (Napa Valley),"The first Merlot offering from this producer, this is 100% varietal and totally full-throttle in its fleshy components of vanilla and chocolate, seasoned in cinnamon. Fresh and somewhat floral, it's bright despite its size and lively on the palate. The wine is made in tiny amounts."
Italy,90,54,Red Blend,red,Agricola Punica 2012 Barrua Red (Isola dei Nuraghi),"Made with 85% Carignano, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot, this open with aromas of black-skinned berry, cedar and oak. The soft, round palate offers fleshy black cherry, black currant, licorice and ground pepper alongside soft acidity and smooth, silky tannins. Drink through 2020."
US,90,40,Pinot Noir,red,Armida 2012 Castelli-Knight Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The vineyard is planted to Dijon clones of Pinot Noir. The result is a concentrated, plush wine, herbal and savory with tightly hewn tannins, a tartness of cranberry and rhubarb, and a substantial finish of cinnamon, clove and darker fruit. The balance between the wine's richness and more ethereal components is nicely drawn."
US,94,72,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Justin 2013 Isosceles Red (Paso Robles),"This hearty blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot is what put Justin on the map, and it still impresses with its elegantly woven tobacco, leather, cocoa, blueberry, and caramel aromas. It hits the palate softly, showing black cherry, baking spice, milk chocolate and faint mint notes, ending in a finish that reveals a firm tannic structure."
US,84,19,Chardonnay,white,Robert Hall 2006 Chardonnay (Paso Robles),"Dry and crisp, with peach and citrus flavors and a touch of oak, this wine benefitted from a cool growing season in usually hot Paso Robles. It has the acidity of a true coastal white wine."
US,85,23,Chardonnay,white,Bota Box 2013 Chardonnay (California),"This is fresh, fruity and medium bodied. Aromas recall mild peach and pineapple, and flavors convey ripe apple with a dash of vanilla, plus a smooth texture. The wine is appealing and shows no rough edges."
US,90,22,Riesling,white,Côte Bonneville 2016 Estate Bottled DuBrul Vineyard Riesling (Yakima Valley),"Single vineyard Rieslings are a relative rarity in the state. This one brings aromas of lime zest, citrus, white peach and apricot. It drinks off dry, leaning a bit sweeter but with well-balanced acidity along with plentiful peach and orange flavors. Apple notes persist on the finish. The sense of balance is impressive."
US,84,20,Pinot Noir,red,Savannah-Chanelle 2001 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"Cola-like in flavor, with earthier notes of tobacco and leather. Drinks pretty lean, and the tannins are strong. Finshes with a bitterness of acids and tannins."
US,91,35,Sangiovese,red,Benessere 2005 Estate Sangiovese (Napa Valley),"Benessere's Sangiovese tests the limits of the variety's ability to thrive in Napa Valley, with good results year after year. The '05 is dry and intricate, with ripe, complex flavors of cherries with the bitter skins and red currants. Refined tannins provide structural integrity. Best now through 2011."
France,94,260,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Leflaive 2009 Les Pucelles Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),"This rich wine balances ripe yellow fruits with intense citrus acidity in a harmonious whole. Its structure is laden with minerality, toast and a smooth, delicious creamy aftertaste."
US,88,20,Zinfandel,red,Kenwood 1997 Nuns Canyon Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Compared to the Mazzoni, this baby has less fruity but pepperier, earthier aromas, and herbal ones, too: licorice and chocolate, although there’s some deeply scented blackberry. It seems crisper and more angular, and more tannic, with a great hidden depth of fruit that needs to be coaxed out through short-term aging."
France,90,74,Chardonnay,white,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2013  Meursault,"With its appealing toast and fruit aromas, this is a rich wine. It does keep plenty of steely texture while allowing the yellow fruits, ripe pear and toast to shine. In style it hovers halfway between the ripe, buttery Meursault of the past and the crisper style of today, a fine compromise and ready to drink now."
Italy,94,227,Red Blend,red,Tenuta San Guido 2011 Sassicaia  (Bolgheri Sassicaia),"Aromas suggest blackberry, cedar and Mediterranean scrub. On the palate, notes of tobacco, licorice, exotic spice and cranberry accent the juicy black-cherry core. It's well balanced and elegant, with silky tannins. Drink 2016–2026."
US,86,14,Red Blend,red,Caricature 2013 Red (California),"Jammy and maple-syrup aromas and full, broad and ripe fruit flavors make this a mouthfilling wine. It has a touch of sweetness with moderate tannins for balance, and a lingering, spicy-sweet note on the finish."
Italy,89,26,Red Blend,red,Goretti 2012  Montefalco Rosso,"Blue flower, tilled soil, spicy plum and grilled herb aromas lead the nose on this medium-bodied, elegant wine. The vibrant, savory palate delivers crushed black cherry, mature blackberry, clove and thyme alongside firm but fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2018."
Italy,87,20,Sangiovese,red,Castello di Monastero 2004  Chianti Classico,"Here's a 2004 Chianti Classico (with a 15% component of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon for extra structure and smoothness) that delivers aromas of wet earth, white mushroom, blackberry, tobacco and leather. Drink it with stewed meats or game dishes."
US,91,20,Chardonnay,white,Rulo 2009 Birch Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Young and still a bit yeasty, with the flavors still integrating. The toasty barrel and bourbon flavors are matched to medium acids and stone fruits. This needs more time in the bottle to show all its strengths."
US,89,25,Syrah,red,Eagles Landing 2004 Syrah (Edna Valley),"Coming from cool Edna Valley, the acidity is here, even in this hot vintage, and so is the clean, long hangtime fruit. The wine bursts with blackberries, cherries, plums and wilder notes of unidentified forest berries and sweet, smoky leather. Drink now, for its complex, juicy youthfulness."
US,85,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Raphael 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (North Fork of Long Island),"Fresh-cut flowers and gooseberries lend characteristically green, grassy notes to this light-bodied, refreshing Sauvignon Blanc. It's delicate in concentration but finishes elegantly on a chalky, mineral note."
US,90,14,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Pamplin 2014 Red I.Q. Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine comes from top sites Canoe Ridge Estate, Champoux, Seven Hills and Wallula. An intriguing blend of 43% Merlot, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Petit Verdot and 17% Malbec, it offers high-toned aromas, with notes of toasty spice and herb in front of raspberry and cherry. Supple and well balanced, the fruit flavors show poise and length."
France,91,32,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Pibran 2012 Château Tour Pibran  (Pauillac),"This is the second wine of Château Pibran, whose vineyard is situated close to those of the the first growths of Mouton and Lafite. Structured and dense, this is a solid, powerful wine, packed with juicy black currant fruits and generous tannins. Give this wine until 2018 before drinking."
US,85,16,Pinot Grigio,white,Francis Coppola 2011 Diamond Collection Pinot Grigio (California),"Sugary sweet and simple, like an apricot, orange and mango fruit juice drink. The alcohol lends body and warmth."
US,88,18,Chardonnay,white,Franciscan 2015 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Oaky butterscotch and baked pear notes give this lushly composed white equal parts heat and body. The apple flavor seems baked and warming on the palate, lending additional richness on the toast-laced finish."
US,93,35,Chardonnay,white,Chappellet 2014 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Grapes for this wine are sourced from a wide selection of sites, from Poe Vineyard in Carneros to Bald Mountain Vineyard on Mount Veeder. Together they sing harmoniously, offering a lightness of color and plenty of perfume around a rich body marked in toffee and supportive oak."
US,87,38,Pinot Noir,red,Concannon 2015 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Rose and turned earth notes mark the entry of this concentrated, tannic wine. Robust strawberry and black cherry flavors fill it out, wrapped in toasted oak."
France,87,20,Pinot Noir,red,Domaines Tatin 2014 Les Demoiselles Tatin Pinot Noir (Reuilly),"Smooth and soft, this has light, fresh red-berry fruits laced with acidity and perfumed by red cherries. The structure is gentle and with the bright fruits, this succulent wine is ready to drink."
Italy,90,39,Red Blend,red,Rignana 2012 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Aromas of dark-skinned berry, rose and wild herb lead the nose. The round, juicy palate doles out ripe black cherry, fleshy raspberry, white pepper and clove while polished tannins provide a smooth, velvety framework. Enjoy through 2019."
US,92,49,Pinot Noir,red,MacPhail 2010 Gap's Crown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Fans of ripe, sweet fruit will love this Pinot. It's huge in juicy raspberry and cherry, with spicy hints of Dr. Pepper and red licorice. It will be fun to see how the wine evolves over the next 6–8 years."
Italy,89,20,Red Blend,red,Il Conventino 2013  Rosso di Montepulciano,"Made from organically farmed grapes, this savory wine opens with aromas of crushed violet, black cherry, wild raspberry, plum, white pepper and baking spices. The succulent fruit palate is supported by chewy tannins and fresh acidity. A licorice note marks the finish."

US,92,38,Syrah,red,Corvalle 2009 Baker Vineyard Syrah (Atlas Peak),"A first-rate Syrah, exhibiting all the desirable aspects of the variety. It's dry, full-bodied and tannic, with blackberry, pie spice, grilled bacon and sandalwood flavors, and enough black pepper to fill a shaker. Drink now–2015."
US,90,28,Merlot,red,Whitehall Lane 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Super-delicious, a soft, luscious wine whose cherry, raspberry and cocoa flavors are wrapped into velvety tannins. Made even richer by the vanilla and toasty caramel of oak barrels. Defines ready-to-drink Napa Valley Merlot."
US,88,21,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Duckhorn 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Muscular, mildly sweaty aromatics make this a little tough to get into, but the flavors are really elevated and complex. There's layered citrus, slate, licorice and spice all working together. The texture is nice, with spiciness coming on late. A bit of sweetness properly offsets the spicy, peppery quality to the finish."
Italy,87,20,Red Blend,red,MandraRossa 2010 Bonera Red (Sicilia),"An easydrinking blend of Nero d'Avola and Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this would pair well with breaded veal or roasted chicken. Aromas include cherry, milk chocolate and blackberry, with a note of toasted pistachio."
US,92,140,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Pride Mountain 2013 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma-Napa),"Spicy clove flavors enwrap rounded tannin and integrated oak in this structured, bold and full-bodied wine. A reserve-tier bottling, it shows deep red fruit, from cassis to currant, and a predominance of both the savory and tart."
Italy,89,40,Sangiovese,red,Altesino 2012 Palazzo Altesi Sangiovese (Toscana),"Here's a sleek Sangiovese that opens with scents of toasted oak, vanilla, blue flowers and mature plum. The round palate is already accessible, serving up sweet black cherry, black raspberry, licorice and mint framed in assertive but fine-grained tannins."
US,88,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cass 2014 C.A.B Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"This bottling marks a stylistic shift in labeling for the winery toward more youthful and creative, and the wine is quite tasty, with aromas of deep black cherry and leather, proving pleasantly rustic. The palate is easy to enjoy, if no particularly complex, with lots of blueberry, Concord grape, white pepper and dark chocolate flavors."
US,88,70,Chardonnay,white,Lynmar 2011 Monastery Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This is one of Lynmar's most expensive Chardonnays, of their six 2011s. It's also one of the most forward and oakiest. Your first impression is of sweet buttered toast, sprinkled with brown sugar and drizzled with melted butterscotch. Then the tropical fruits kick in, brightened with citrusy acids. It's an impressive feat, but the wine feels overworked, and lacks the sustaining interest of Lynmar's other bottlings."
US,92,35,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Baker & Brain 2013 Pendulum Red (Monterey County),"A savory rather than fruity blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache, this bottling offers black pepper, anise and light violet alongside boysenberry and elderberry fruit on the nose. The palate tightens up into underripe cherry, thyme, marjoram and bay leaf, with very dry elderberry fruit tones."
US,93,75,Chardonnay,white,Chalk Hill 2014 Carol Ann Chardonnay (Chalk Hill),"Rich, round and ripe, this is made from a musqué clone originally from Dijon, France, meant to impart memorable aromatics. It does, in spades, revealing wafts of honeysuckle and fresh pineapple amid a bright, tangy twist of acidity and gravely minerality, sharing a touch of salt on the finish."
US,85,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Chatham 2013 Church Creek Vintner's Blend Red (Virginia's Eastern Shore),"Menthol and pepper ride over dark cherry and spicy plum aromas. The palate is tight and restrained, offering dusty cherry and redcurrant flavors that succumb to an ultimately green, stemmy finish."
France,93,45,Pinot Noir,red,Capitain-Gagnerot 2008 Les Moutottes Premier Cru  (Aloxe-Corton),It is rare to find mature red Burgundy being sold directly from the producer's cellar. This 2008 from an above-average vintage is certainly showing signs of rich maturity. It has developed the undergrowth aromas and spice flavors of ready-to-drink Pinot Noir. It has also retained plenty of acidity. It is a lightly tannic wine that is ready to drink.
US,92,75,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Acaibo 2013 Red (Sonoma County),"This blend is proprietors Claire and Gonzague Lurton's foray into California fruit: the two of them together owner several estates in Bordeaux. Their estate vineyard site, still in replanting mode, sits atop a compelling knoll atop Chalk Hill. Leathery and smoky, this wine is classically styled in currant and pencil lead, with a dry, restrained body that lingers on the palate."
US,88,42,Zinfandel,red,Bruliam 2015 Rocky Ridge Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile),"Restrained and dusty in leathery tannin, this wine opens in the glass to unravel bold black-fruit and licorice power, offering stark succulence and moderate acidity on the palate."
Italy,94,65,Red Blend,red,Podere Sapaio 2008 Sapaio  (Bolgheri Superiore),"This inky wine opens with black concentration and rich aromas of mature cherry, almond paste, spice, blackberry and plum. Integrated wood tones of leather and toasted coffee complete the picture and help render soft but structured tannins. Drink after 2015."
US,87,15,Riesling,white,Inspire Moore 2016 Love Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Smoky and tightly wound on the nose, this off-dry Riesling needs aeration and time to open and reveal itself. Fresh yellow-apple and peach flavors are delicately concentrated on the palate but brightened by racy lemon-lime acidity."
US,93,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Joseph Phelps 2014 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This wine is predominately Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller amounts of other Bordeaux red varieties. Together, they offer bold, ripe red-currant and -berry flavors, with a rich entry and gravelly texture. Highly stylized, grippy tannins and a leather note provide additional strength."
US,87,38,Chardonnay,white,Testarossa 2014 Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Very light aromas of apricot and apple blossom show on this appellation blend by the single-vineyard specialists, whose winery is based in Los Gatos. A nice touch of acid marks the palate, where lemon zest meets with ripe Pink Lady apple flavors."
US,86,16,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Mercy 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Arroyo Seco),"This rocky appellation delivers aromas of wet cement, lemon-lime ice, light mint and a tiny bit of asphalt on the nose. The palate shows cut apples, lemon peels and citrus-laced pear cider flavors."
US,87,35,Pinot Noir,red,Cru 2010 Appellation Series Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Ripe, flashy raspberry, cherry and red currant flavors abound in this silky Pinot Noir. It has oak-driven notes of buttered toast and wood spice, and while it's not especially complex, and it's not likely to age, it does offer immediate pleasure."
US,91,16,Pinot Gris,white,Iris Vineyards 2012 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"Sourced from the Chalice (estate) vineyard, this aromatic and seductive wine presents a compelling mix of tree fruits, racy acidity, and a rich, textural, open mouthfeel. The flavors of pears, orange peel and snappy spices linger deliciously through a long finish."
Italy,89,22,Red Blend,red,Vignamaggio 2013 Gherardino  (Chianti Classico),"A blend of Sangiovese and 15% Merlot, this round, medium-bodied wine offers aromas of dark berry, blue flowers and a whiff of cedar. The friendly, accessible palate delivers juicy black cherry, tobacco and a hint of licorice alongside soft tannins and bright acidity. Drink through 2017."
Italy,92,60,Sangiovese,red,Poggio Scalette 2004 Il Carbonaione Sangiovese (Toscana),"Thick, dark concentration sets the tone, but elegance and harmony are achieved thanks to delicate mineral and balsam notes that add buoyancy and personality. This is a wine that speaks volumes about its Tuscan territory and you can almost taste that sun-drenched, chalky minerality sucked up through the vines' roots."
US,93,40,Chardonnay,white,Byron 2014 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Seared lemon, hazelnut, brown butter and sandalwood with a graphite minerality come through on the nose of this complex wine from Jonathan Nagy. The palate offers hints of herbs and chamomile at first, then washes of citrusy acidity and apple notes, all held together with steely tension."
US,85,15,Pinot Noir,red,La Merika 2013 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"Shy aromas of graphite, rust, dried black cherries and a slightly sour element greet the nose on this wine. The palate offers rose petal and cherry flavors, proving a tad one-dimensional but easily quaffable."
US,87,20,Pinot Noir,red,Wild Horse 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"For twenty bucks, you get a a cool-climate Pinot that's eminently drinkable. It's bone dry, crisp in acidity and delicately structured, with cola, raspberry and persimmon flavors. It won't age, but is a fine example of Central Coast Pinot Noir. With production of 140,000 cases, it's easy to find."
US,84,13,Riesling,white,Wagner 2006 Semi Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"This Riesling has aromas that almost mimic a Chardonnay: toasty cream, vanilla, spice. On the palate, those more complex flavors continue, but are buoyed by some acidity and an intriguing touch of sweet flowers. Overall, a tasty sip."
France,91,59,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Grand Mayne 2000  Saint-Émilion,"A modern, smooth wine, with polished fruit and a dark purple color. The wine is full of new wood, but still dominated by liquorice and dark chocolate flavors. It should develop relatively quickly, over the next 10 years."
Italy,87,9,Pinot Grigio,white,Mezzacorona 2014 Pinot Grigio (Vigneti delle Dolomiti),"Pretty aromas of white spring blossoms and Bartlett pear lead the nose on this bright, easy-drinking white. The lively palate offers tart green-apple and light mineral notes alongside crisp acidity."
US,84,18,White Blend,white,San Antonio 2008 Heritage Blanc Estate Select White (Central Coast),"A multi-varietal blend, based on Viognier and Riesling. It's dryish to off-dry, and acidic, with savory flavors of oranges, limes and honeysuckle."
US,86,26,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,3 Horse Ranch Vineyards 2012 Barrel Select Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot-Petit Verdot Red (Washington),"This brooding wine shows notes of tire rubber, herbs, dark chocolate and blue fruit. It's elegant, with mouthwatering acids and grainy tannins."
US,91,48,Syrah,red,Baby Bear 2009 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Baby Bear is a collaboration between Eric Dunham and the actor Kyle MacLachlan, styled as a lighter version of their Pursued by Bear Syrah. This is a most enjoyable wine, with a big yum factor from the generous barrel scents and flavors. Toasty, smoky, a bit astringent, but beautifully streamlined, it displays a full array of black fruits, adorned with lots of dusty, toasty barrel highlights."
US,89,39,Pinot Noir,red,J. Christopher 2014 Dundee Hills Cuvée Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Ripe red fruits mingle gracefully, along with suggestions of toasted coconut, from aging in one-quarter new barrels. There is a metallic streak running through the finish as well, which might suggest that you give it some extra aeration before drinking."
Italy,91,60,Red Blend,red,Fattoria di Magliano 2011 Poggio Bestiale  (Maremma Toscana),"Sleek and savory, this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc opens with aromas of mocha, spicy plum, scorched earth and leather. The juicy palate offers black currant, cassis, black pepper, savory herb and licorice alongside polished tannins."
US,91,69,Pinot Noir,red,Sojourn 2015 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Tight-grained tannin plays a supporting role to this wine's undeniable earthiness, a mix of compost and wild mushroom. Subtle on the nose, the savory character gives way eventually to a density and concentration of brighter flavors, from cherry and citrus to spiky pine."
US,92,50,Pinot Noir,red,Summerland 2012 Theresa-Noelle Esatate Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"There's a subtle yet thorough menthol character to the nose of this single-vineyard wine from the west end of the appellation, alongside hibiscus juice. It's tinglingly acidic on the palate yet ripe and juicy at the same time, like mild cherry juice meeting up with sassafras."
US,87,35,Chardonnay,white,Aubichon Cellars 2014 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Though aged in neutral oak, this wine opens with scents and flavor hints of toast and butter. The fruit is clean and generic, like a fresh apple, but the mouthfeel lacks life and fades into a flat finish. Drink up."
US,89,45,Merlot,red,Fidelitas 2007 Red Mountain Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Pure Merlot, from the Red Mountain vineyard, this displays that AVA's stiff, hard-edged tannins, keeping the fruit pinned down into a compact core. Cassis and black cherry, iron filings and some tar are all carefully balanced. There's plenty of muscle for further aging, and a hint of heat in the finish."
France,90,17,Red Blend,red,Domaine Rotier 2014 Les Gravels Red (Gaillac),"This crisp blend of Braucol and Syrah comes from a gravel terrace. While it has fine acidity, the wine also has ripe red fruits, sweet plum flavors and an attractive sprinkling of spice. Drink this wine from 2017."
France,94,428,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Faiveley 2011  Bâtard-Montrachet,"Rich and full-bodied, the flavors of quince and pear are balanced by great acidity. It is a big, powerful wine that, with its tight fruit and steely background, promises long aging. The tropical fruits also need several years to show strongly. Drink from 2018."
US,86,14,Merlot,red,Edna Valley Vineyard 2015 Merlot (Central Coast),"Iron-laced beef aromas meet boysenberry and wet stone on the nose of this widely available and smartly priced wine from the historic producer. Red cherry fruit shows on the palate along with a touch of turned earth, making for a pleasant yet simple sip."
US,92,40,Chardonnay,white,Tendril 2014 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Sophisticated in every way, this engaging, complex effort begins with fresh apple fruit, then layers in lemon curd and sliced orange components. There's a touch of beeswax, and a creamy mouthfeel that stretches out the finish."
France,90,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château German 2014  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"A fruity, juicy wine with balanced tannins and red fruits. It is a lively perfumed wine that has some toasty tannins in the background. Drink this ripe wine from 2019. One of five wineries owned by Bernadette Faure and Alain Aubert; their daughters oversee vineyards, winemaking and marketing."
US,93,40,Pinot Noir,red,Dutton-Goldfield 1999 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Fabulous, fun wine. The aromas are beautiful: cola, black raspberry, dark tea, vanilla, smoke and dusty spices. On the palate, it's limpid, delicate. It seems to float, yet there's powerful fruit. Wonderful now and through 2003."
France,89,32,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Michel Redde et Fils 2015 Les Tuilières  (Sancerre),"Fresh and herbal, this young, textured wine shows green fruits and crisp acidity right up front, making it immediately attractive. Drink it now for this fruit or wait until later in 2017 for it to soften."
US,85,15,Red Blend,red,Truett Hurst 2012 Curious Beasts Red (California),"Rich grape and blackberry flavors in a slightly sweet style make this generous and smooth. Full bodied, it has a welcome touch of tannin to keep it appetizing."
US,92,56,Pinot Noir,red,MacRostie 2013 Cummings Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"From a Charlie Chenoweth-farmed site, this wine is vividly marked by earth and mushroom with bolts of cherry and cranberry. Bright acidity complements a firmness of tannin and texture that flirts with being leathery, the finish all about cola spice."
US,90,35,Zinfandel,red,Benessere 2012 Collins Holystone Vineyard Zinfandel (St. Helena),"From a vineyard originally planted in 1922 to what is thought to be 100% Zinfandel, this wine brims with notes of yeasty baked bread, leather and high-toned raspberry and boysenberry. Layered and supported by oak, the medium-bodied weight supports a long finish."
US,91,32,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Sarah's Vineyard 2012 Madonne Estate Red (Santa Clara Valley),"There is a lot of herbal and woody nuance to the nose of this blend of 72% Grenache, 10% Syrah, 10% Mourvèdre, 5% Carignane and 3% Counoise. Thyme, dried fennel and Earl Grey tea aromas lift the dark strawberry fruit. Shaved cedar flavors frame the palate, where lavender and other purple flowers integrate seamlessly into the soft red fruit."
US,83,10,Chardonnay,white,Tin Roof 2011 Chardonnay (California),"Made in the popular style, this Chardonnay has zesty acidity that gives brightness to the orange, pear, peach and tropical fruit flavors."
US,88,30,Syrah,red,Cimarone 2009 Reserve Three Creek Vineyard Syrah (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"This is a very ripe, fruity Syrah, rich in raspberry, blueberry and cherry jam flavors, with hints of bacon and pepper. The acid-tannin balance is lovely, making the wine easy to like now."
US,92,40,Syrah,red,Dutton Estate 2006 Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Big, rich and extracted, this Syrah is a bit heavy and ponderous now. It shows soft flavors of melted blackberry jam, plum liqueur, dark chocolate, grilled meat and smoky oak, liberally dusted with black pepper. Fancy, but could use through 2009 to knit together."
France,87,15,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Famille Perrin 2013 Red (Côtes du Rhône Villages),"This is firm and tannic, reflecting the challenges of the vintage, yet it does show classic garrigue aromas and flavors of black olives and dark cherries. Drink it now with grilled meats, or hold it a year or two in the hopes of it softening a little."
Italy,93,70,Sangiovese,red,Caparzo 2012 La Casa  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Enticing scents of red berry, baking spice, Mediterranean scrub and a hint of eucalyptus slowly emerge. The elegantly structured palate delivers black cherry, licorice, clove and espresso framed in youthfully austere but refined tannins. It's still young and tightly wound but balanced, with bright acidity. Drink 2020–2028."
Italy,88,35,Red Blend,red,Montemercurio 2009 Messaggero  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"Aromas of underbrush, blackberry, ground black pepper and a whiff of leather come together in the glass. The warm, forward palate shows dried black cherry, licorice, clove and sage accompanied by dusty tannins that leave a drying finish. Drink sooner rather than later to catch the remaining fruit richness."
US,87,28,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Newton 2009 Red Label Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa County),"Ripe and sweet in chocolate and blackberries, this is a Cabernet made for drinking now with rich fare, such as short ribs. It's soft in both tannins and acids, which makes it instantly appealing."
US,92,50,Pinot Noir,red,La Crema 2013 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"A dash of spicy oak suggests nutmeg and cinnamon in the aroma of this well-balanced, rich and flavorful wine. Cherry, red currant and touches of mint and cedar fill out the palate, and the texture is just firm enough, with fine tannins for great balance."
US,91,45,Pinot Noir,red,Gehricke 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Softly floral and brightly spicy, this wine rocks in red cherry and tangy citrus, sure to please a broad range of palates in its approachable elegance and restraint. Toasted vanilla oak rounds out the finish."
US,94,45,Chardonnay,white,Gary Farrell 2013 Olivet Lane Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Almond and anise open what evolves into a concentrated expression of a stellar vineyard site in a great vintage in good winemaking hands. Honey and baked peach initially fool the palate into anticipating that this wine might head into full-blown hedonism, but subtle layers of lemon, grapefruit and pear keep it crisp, fresh and ultimately complex. Creamy, it retains plenty of acidity for balance."
France,93,100,Pinot Noir,red,Olivier Leflaive 2010 Epenots Premier Cru  (Pommard),"This is complex and powerful, with its energy directed equally at the concentrated tannins and at the ripe damson and plum fruits. It's going to be a delicious wine—the wood element smoothing the firm edge. Age for at least five years."
US,87,35,Red Blend,red,Kuleto Estate 2012 Native Son Red (Napa Valley),"A Zinfandel-based blend, with Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese, Syrah, Merlot and Malbec, this wine is hearty, thick and dense. It traffics in smoky char, leathery tannins and a strong taste of tobacco, finishing with a flash of red plum."
France,87,50,Chardonnay,white,Château de Beauregard 2015 Vignes Blances  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"This soft, ripe wine has good apricot and peach flavors alongside the crisper citrus acidity. It is spicy, fruity and ready to drink."
US,87,36,Pinot Noir,red,Sarah's Vineyard 2012 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Clara Valley),"Black tea, charred cherries and tree bark aromas arise off this wine from a cooler part of a warm appellation. The wine is a bit thin and light on the palate once sipped, with pomegranate fruit. Drink at the beach or with lighter fare."
US,86,23,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Babcock 2001 Eleven Oaks Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara County),"Tasted twice, with divergent results; the 86 rating reflects the average of both bottles. One bottle seemed overly heavy, with an odd mix of jalapeño peppers and honey. The better (and hopefully more representative) bottle showed richness without excessive weight, hints of cream and toast and penetrating citrus flavors, and would have rated 89 points on its own."
US,91,36,Chardonnay,white,Summerland 2013 Sierra Madre Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"This iconic regional vineyard is widely sourced, and this bottling presents it well. Fresh aromas of Meyer lemon and graphite shavings get layered with oak-related scents of toasted coconut flake and ground vanilla. The palate surrounds a core of lemon-lime-laced apple and fleshy ripe pear, with guava skin on the finish. Very easy to drink."
US,87,24,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Vigilance 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County),"Toasty, smoky oak aromas and flavors dominate this medium-bodied wine that is soft around the edges. With little noticeable tannin and low acidity it comes off as slightly sweet."

Italy,87,25,Sangiovese,red,Pinino 2012  Rosso di Montalcino,"Aromas recall underbrush, truffle, violet, tobacco leaf and black berry. The palate offers up red cherry, white pepper, clove, licorice and espresso alongside angular and drying tannins."
US,92,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Lone Madrone 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (York Mountain),"York Mountain actually predates Paso Robles as an appellation, so it's great to see Neil Collins making such excellent wine from its nearly forgotten western slopes. This bottling shows stewed blackberry, balsamic fig, licorice spice and purple flower touches on the nose. The well-integrated palate uses sprightly acidity to deliver blackberry and blueberry flavors, with thyme, nettle, dill and graphite accents."
US,90,110,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Paoletti 1997 Non Plus Ultra Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Extremely dark, with toast, cherry liqueur and forest notes on the nose; this opens into deep black fruit, licorice and espresso flavors. The mouthfeel is full and rich, as it transitions effortlessly into a smooth, dry, anise and briar-tinged finish that has an interesting and elegant viscosity to it. A black beauty needing three to five years to develop."
France,88,28,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Luquet 2010 Vieilles Vignes  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"This is a rich, wood-aged single-vineyard selection that has a balanced toast element, crisp fruit and a taut texture. Acidity currently drives this wine, so give it another year to come into full focus."
France,95,123,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Vincent Girardin 2010  Corton-Charlemagne,"Powerful and concentrated, this has an intense expression of ripe tropical fruits. The wood shows strongly at this stage, although with this amount of richness, it has the weight and the power to develop well over many years."
Italy,88,20,Red Blend,red,Fabio Motta 2012 Pievi  (Bolgheri),"An easy-drinking blend of 50% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Sangiovese, this doles out juicy black cherry, blackberry, white pepper and a hint of licorice. Silky tannins and fresh acidity provide the easygoing framework."
US,87,30,Zinfandel,red,Cline 2012 Live Oak Vineyards Zinfandel (Contra Costa County),"This has bright raspberry and almost-sweet blackberry flavors, full body, moderate tannins and a long warm finish. It tastes polished, soft and satiny smooth."
US,87,22,Chardonnay,white,Roth 2011 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"This is an interesting wine that offers plenty of Chardonnay pleasure at a fair price. It's dry and creamy, with pineapple, peach and lime fruit flavors, brightened by tart acidity and accented with sweet oak."
France,91,29,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château de Roquebrune 2010 Cuvée Reine  (Lalande de Pomerol),"Solid and powerful, it has a great mix of very ripe fruit with dense tannins. Blackberry fruits, laced with licorice and dark chocolate, contrast with a juicy, lightly herbal element. This mainly Merlot wine is destined for a fine future. Drink from 2017."
US,90,22,Pinot Grigio,white,Swanson 2014 Pinot Grigio (Sonoma Mountain),"Having spent no time in oak, this crisp, clean white is resplendent in lemon curd and vanilla, joined midway by additional layers of just-picked peach. Medium bodied, with the right texture to hold up to a range of spicy foods, it offers a vibrantly lively finish."
US,89,20,Pinot Gris,white,Emerson 2015 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"A pale copper color, this is not a rosé, but it shows the effect of a cold soak prior to pressing, capturing the light blush color natural to the grape. Smooth and demonstrating suggestions of strawberry, it brings up pear-skin phenolics in the finish, adding texture, length and some sassy bite."
Italy,92,99,Red Blend,red,Tedeschi 2008 Capitel Monte Olmi  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"Made from vines in Tedeschi's steep Monte Olmi Vineyard, this is a structured, well-balanced Amarone, with an intense fruit-and-spice fragrance. The palate delivers black cherry, mint and nutmeg flavors, with a hint of tobacco. It has great depth, with a velvety mouthfeel supported by fresh acidity."
US,89,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Wellington 2007 Karren Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Mountain),"Inky black in hue, this wine is enormously tannic, which gives it a mouth-numbing astringency. Along with the structure, it has a gigantic, sweet-tasting core of blackberry jam and currant flavors, which breaks through the bitterness. Everything suggests ageability; it should mellow after 2015."
US,93,60,Merlot,red,Pride Mountain 2011 Merlot (Napa County-Sonoma County),"Leathery on the tongue, this lovely Merlot, with 7% Cabernet Sauvignon blended in, offers inviting notes of plum and cherry, completely juicy, around firm, strong tannins and balanced acidity. From two separate, rocky blocks on the winery property, this wine is concentrated and smooth. Enjoy through 2021–2025."
US,91,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Trinchero 2012 Mario's Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a blend of grapes from Mario's Vineyard and Central Park West Vineyard, both in St. Helena. Full bodied and voluptuous, it offers classically tuned touches of cedar, dried herb, lingering red cherry and cassis. Sizable tannins give it plushness and depth. Drink now through 2022."
Italy,85,18,White Blend,white,Collevite 2012 White (Falerio),"Here's a bright and easy-drinking wine made from Trebbiano, Passerina and Pecorino grapes. It has sensations of acacia flower, lemon and peach alongside vibrant acidity."
Italy,88,25,Red Blend,red,Astorre Noti 2012  Chianti Classico,"Savory and ripe, this organically produced wine opens with aromas of dark plum, blackberry and blue flowers. The open, easygoing palate offers juicy black cherry accented with notes of clove and anise. Polished tannins provide the framework."
US,85,23,Chardonnay,white,Textbook 2009 Fin de Journée Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"A rather simple Chardonnay made in the modern style, with lots of flamboyance and flash, but not much subtlety. Strong and rich in pineapple and peach jam flavors, it's brightened with zesty acidity."
US,87,70,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Shafer 2005 One Point Five Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"This is a sort of junior bottling to their world-famous and superexpensive Hillside Select. The 2005 is a very good Cab (with 2% Petite Verdot), but a bit on the soft, sweet, obvious side. Showing pie-filling, almost candied cherry, blackberry, raspberry and chocolate flavors, it resembles many other California Cabernets that don't cost nearly as much."
US,94,20,Riesling,white,Poet's Leap 2007 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Loaded with honeysuckle, melon, pear, peach and hints of sweet grapefruit, this juicy wine perfectly captures the intensity of Washington Riesling and the complexity of German wines. Buoyant and precise, with notes of chalk and limestone in the finish, this is a stunning achievement in a challenging vintage."
Italy,91,30,Sangiovese,red,Castello di Gabbiano 2008 Bellezza  (Chianti Classico),"Bellezza is now labeled Chianti Classico (through 2007 it was labeled only as Toscana), based on Sangiovese grapes that deliver aromas of cherry, toasted almond, chocolate, rum cake and exotic spice. The wine is long, fresh and intense in the mouth and would pair well with steak and grilled porcini mushrooms."
Italy,87,10,Syrah,red,Cusumano 2008 Syrah (Sicilia),"This bright, well-priced Syrah shows typical aromas of bright cherry, blueberry, smoked meat and peppercorn. The mouthfeel is equally attractive with plush ripeness and a soft, supple texture."
France,90,40,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château les Roches de Ferrand 2010  Fronsac,"Initially austere in the mouth, this is a serious and complex wine. It has firm tannins, layers of blackberry fruits and acidity along with a strong feeling of wood aging. Powerful and with good depth, it's a wine that needs age. Drink from 2017."
US,89,11,Red Blend,red,Bogle 2010 Essential Red (California),"This wine is sensationally rich and ripe with wild cherry, mocha, anise and tobacco flavors, with a long, spicy finish. It really impresses for sheer deliciousness. The blend is Zinfandel, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah. It's easy to find, with production an incredible 125,000 cases."
US,83,10,Red Blend,red,Les Bourgeois NV Fleur du Vin Fruity Semi Dry Red (Missouri),"Muffled, shy aromas are redolent of cherries, dried flowers and pear drops. Soft and rounded, the palate has a sweet quality about its core, with mild acids and a dusting of tannins."
France,89,16,Riesling,white,Domaine Zinck 2015 Portrait Riesling (Alsace),"The mellow scent of baked apple rises from the glass, cut by ripe, equally mellow freshness on the palate. This wine is mild for a Riesling but very enjoyable, clean and fruity, with a mellow apple note that really gets you in the end."
US,87,45,Pinot Noir,red,Kokomo 2006 Peters Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Very delicious in terms of sheer flavor. Floods the mouth with ripe, rich black cherries, black raspberries, milk chocolate, licorice and spicy, oaky vanilla. Could have more structure, though. Drink now."
US,89,35,Chardonnay,white,Dutton-Goldfield 2010 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A good, fairly complex California Chardonnay, marked by ripe, jammy orange, pear and apricot fruit flavors. Winemaker interventions also play roles, with the malolactic fermentation adding buttery notes and French oak contributing sweet caramel."
Italy,84,10,Pinot Grigio,white,Blason 2007 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Isonzo),"Luminous and bright, this well-priced Pinot Grigio doles out fresh fruit flavors of peach, apricot and tangerine. The wine is lean and firm with an easygoing approach and spicy crispness on the finish."
US,93,85,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Rocca 2010 Grigsby Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),"This cellar-worthy wine is enjoyable now, rich and powerful in bright red and blackberry fruit, spice, toast and black licorice. Concentrated and layered, the tannins are thick and interwoven, and the juicy texture offers balanced acidity. Streaks of chocolate and earthy menthol on the nose and palate give distinctiveness. Enjoy now through 2024."
France,86,20,Pinot Noir,red,Louis Chavy 2011  Bourgogne,"Delicately perfumed with bright red-fruit aromas, this is a light, fruity, forward wine that is ready to drink now. Acidity cuts through the palate and soft tannins linger on the finish."
US,95,65,Pinot Noir,red,Trombetta 2012 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Dark, concentrated and grippy, this is a sizable Pinot from a cool, coveted vineyard. Juicy blue and blackberry fruit dominate on the nose and palate, surrounded by exotic cedar, clove, oak and toffee, a swipe of vanilla lurking behind the front flavors. The big tannins will appreciate time in the cellar, through 2022–2024."
US,90,17,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Liberated 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"This is a new line of label-driven wine meant to be adventurous and whimsical. Catchy label aside, the wine inside entirely delivers in well-integrated fruit and floral characteristics, showing the crispness of its stainless-steel fermentation. Tangy, it's both tart and tropical, finishing focused and lean."
US,86,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cosentino 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa County),"A little minty, with a clove and pepper edge to the black currant, carob and cedar flavors, but nice and dry, with a firm structure. Doesn't seem like an ager."
US,86,18,Chardonnay,white,Wagner 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Lithe and lean, this Chardonnay suggests a lighter-bodied, slighter expression. Zesty acidity and tart lemon-lime flavors are refreshing and thirst quenching on the palate though. The finish eases into delicate notes of spice and toast. Drink now through 2019."
US,88,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Sierra Starr 2012 Inertia Red (Sierra Foothills),Dark fruit aromas and flavors join with a generous texture and full body to make a complete and satisfying wine. This has just enough tannin to make it appetizing and well balanced.
France,85,10,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Bois Redon 2010  Bordeaux Supérieur,"Initially austere, this wine is driven by notes of bitter chocolate and lean fruit. The fruit weight promises some attractive aging, but for the present, it is firm, dry and solidly tannic."
US,86,18,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Angeline 2014 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Fairly simple blackberry, olallieberry and strawberry fruits meet with just a touch of dried herbs and black spice on the nose of this bottling. It's very juicy on the sip, with more ollalieberry fruit."
France,94,85,Pinot Noir,red,Louis Jadot 2009 Petite Chapelle Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),"At this stage, the wine is all dark structure and very firm. It will need time to develop its full potential as an intensely rich wine. Concentrated and firm, it is powered by tannins as well as sweet red fruits. So age for five years at least."
US,93,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Sterling 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Just beautiful, this is the best Sterling Reserve Cabernet in years, and a huge improvement over the 2008. It shows ripe, lush flavors of blackberry and black cherry pie, anise, cola and smoky sandalwood, wrapped into sweetly gentle, complex tannins. Drink this beauty over the next six years."
US,89,16,Riesling,white,Sheldrake Point 2013 Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Zesty lime and crushed stones lend revitalizing tang to this squeaky-fresh Riesling. Off dry in style, it's chock full of sweet peach and tangerine flavors. Forward and fruity, it's appealing yet elegant."
US,87,55,Syrah,red,Martella 2009 Camel Hill Vineyard Syrah (Santa Cruz Mountains),"A strong Syrah, intense and concentrated in the way of ripe, high-alcohol wines. Shows potent flavors of berries, cherries, bacon and spices, wrapped into smoky oak. Tasty and easy to drink now."
US,93,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Phifer Pavitt 2007 Date Night Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is an elaborately constructed wine, rich in fruit and tannins, and far better than the rather ordinary 2006. But it's nowhere near ready to drink now. Erupts with ripe, juicy blackberries, black cherries, minerals and sweet cassis. The grapes are from the Pope Valley region. Very big, bold and dramatic, but immature. Hold for a good six years."
US,91,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Cadence 2011 Coda Red (Red Mountain),"This four-grape, Bordeaux-style blend offers firm, concentrated plum and cassis fruit, stiff tannins and a touch of iron and graphite. It saw 45% new French oak—pretty impressive for a $25 red."
US,91,25,Syrah,red,Tamarack Cellars 2011 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Still quite compact with youthful tension and energy, this will reward your patience. Dense flavors of raspberry, boysenberry and cassis are streaked with espresso and dark chocolate. The length is impressive."
US,91,67,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Trione 2011 Block Twenty One Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"This is a standout wine from the vintage, made from a selection of the Trione Cloverdale Ranch. Blended with smaller percentages of Merlot, Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec, it sings in robust red and black cherry and currant, as well as more luxurious waves of chocolate and vanilla. There's a forwardness to the texture, making for a wine that's both big and happy."
US,89,48,Pinot Noir,red,En Garde 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Elusive raspberry tries to find its way to the fore of this big-bodied Pinot, its time in oak apparent yet integrated. Savory herb notes provide a complexity and balance against the dark cherry fruit, rounding out a wine that has girth but also finesse."
US,89,19,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Mill Creek 2011 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),"This crisp Sauvignon Blanc shows how well the variety can perform in Dry Creek Valley. It offers lots of savory citrus, green grass, tropical fruit, honey and white pepper flavors. The acidity makes the mouth water."
US,90,25,Chardonnay,white,Lynmar 2013 Laguna Ridge Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"This highly accessible, reasonably priced Chardonnay sees no new oak. It offers aromatics of orange blossom and fresh-squeezed lemon followed by a lean texture of more lemon, honeysuckle and melon. Stock up."
US,83,32,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Troon 2005 Buren Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Applegate Valley),"This is a sharp, high-toned Cabernet, which begins with nail polishy aromas and some cherry candy flavors, then quickly tails off. It lacks both depth and detail, making it difficult to understand what merits the reserve designation."
US,81,15,Pinot Noir,red,Brotherhood 2005 Pinot Noir (New York),"Subtle aromas of cherry and cinnamon spice are followed by an overly tart, acidic character on this wine from historic Brotherhood. Light and somewhat one dimensional, it does have a clean finish and its minerality will recommend it to food pairing."
US,87,10,Riesling,white,J. Lohr 2014 Bay Mist Riesling (Monterey County),"Lemon-lime soda, chalk and gin-and-tonic cocktail elements power the nose on this zesty, medium-sweet bottling. The mouthfeel is soft, with lime juice and quinine cutting the ripe orange-syrup notes."
France,91,65,Chardonnay,white,Henriet-Bazin NV Blanc de Blancs Premier Cru Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"Unusually for a Champagne from the Montagne de Reims, better known for its Pinot Noir, this is a 100% Chardonnay. It is ripe and fruity—a warm wine with apricot and spice as well as crisper citrus. Drink this smooth wine now."
US,91,60,Chardonnay,white,D.R. Stephens 2013 Star Vineyard Chardonnay (Rutherford),"Offering deep complexity, this bold, brazen wine is decadent in caramel and toffee aromas and flavors, with a foundation of ripe Gravenstein apple and hazelnuts. The oak is pronounced but it adds more than it subtracts. Cellar through 2018."
US,88,16,Chardonnay,white,De Loach 2006 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"There's lots of acidity in this young wine, which gives it a slightly minty, prickly feeling that actually adds to its food-friendliness. With pineapple, green apple, spice and smoky oak flavors, it finishes thoroughly dry. Easy to find, with 30,000 case production."
US,92,62,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Barton 2013 The Dance Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"Dark and velvety on the nose, this blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Cabernet Franc and 10% Malbec offers a plump but balanced expression of black cherry, black pepper and dried herbs. The complex palate combines exotic plum and dried strawberry with mocha and crumbled mint flavors."
US,87,14,Riesling,white,Fox Run 2012 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Wisps of smoke and earth lend a dark, mysterious tone to flavors of fresh apple, melon and pineapple on this delicate off-dry Riesling. Lemon-lime acidity pierces the palate, driving a long, honey-kissed finish."
US,92,35,Chardonnay,white,Dutton-Goldfield 2008 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Beautiful and likeable for its dryness, crisp minerality, and the sleek, clean mouthfeel. The fruit suggests oak-inspired pears, oranges and citrons. This elegant quaff gets better as it warms in the glass. Drink now."
US,88,17,Chardonnay,white,First Press 2011 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"What a bargain in a fine Chardonnay. There is a hint of vanilla, flavors of pears, apples and melons and a rich mouthfeel, perfectly balanced by ample acidity. Should be easy to find, with 15,000 cases produced. From Delicato."
US,87,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Viluko 2012 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"This 100% varietal wine is both lean and dusty with a grip of firm, dry tannin. Chocolate, tar, cedar and pencil combine for a profile that's both rich and classically savory."
US,90,15,Pinot Gris,white,Walnut City WineWorks 2012 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"All-stainless fermented, this flavorful Pinot Gris displays fleshy, ripe pear flavors, with a light dusting of cinnamon spice. Simply delicious, and ready right now."
US,86,22,Zinfandel,red,Angel Vine 2008 Les Collines Vineyard Zinfandel (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Not quite as good as the 2007 Les Collines from this producer, but perhaps it just needs more bottle age. Light spritz and flavors of berry punch, along with not-yet-integrated barrel toast. Give it another year to fill out."
US,90,56,Pinot Noir,red,A.P. Vin 2015 Kanzler Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"From a lovely site in the Sebastopol Hills, this wine is tart and tangy with pomegranate and dark cherry flavors, deepened with spicy earth and cardamom accents. It offers length, breadth and a full-bodied expression of the grape and place."
US,90,28,Sangiovese,red,Noceto 2008 Marmellata Sangiovese (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"This 100% Sangiovese from this Sierra Foothills Sangiovese specialist has a giant mouthfeel, full of plummy and earthy dark cherry and caramel molasses. As big as the wine is, the tannins are softened and the wine has a long finish. An excellent wine to pair with Italian sausage, risotto or so many other Italian-inspired meals."
US,90,25,Chardonnay,white,MacRostie 2011 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"This is clean and brisk in lemony acidity, and it offers concentrated, complex flavors of honeyed pineapples, limes, oranges and mangoes. It's dry and finessed."
US,92,58,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Chateau Montelena 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Softened by the addition of 13% Merlot and 1% Cabernet Franc, this wine leads with smoky oak and baked bread aromas, followed by cassis and mocha notes. Medium bodied, with a seamless texture, it adds baked cherry, cedar and tomato leaf components with measured richness."
US,89,26,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Lieb 2015 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (North Fork of Long Island),"Whiffs of talcum powder and orange blossom perfume this bright, brisk wine. Crisp white peach and melon flavors are penetrating on the palate, finishing on a clean, slightly mineral tone. Drink now through 2017."
US,90,14,Riesling,white,Heron Hill 2014 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"A hint of pine fronds lends a cool, alpine touch to tart white peach and pineapple flavors in this vivacious dry Riesling. Zesty acidity enlivens the midpalate and extends out the finish. Drink now–2017."
US,87,29,Riesling,white,Coquelicot 2016 Riesling,"A sweet smell of honeysuckle and grapefruit candy permeates the nose of this bottling, along with cut honeydew melon and apple blossom. Sugary mandarin juice is the primary flavor on the palate, but it's properly offset by acidity a chalky texture."
US,87,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Spence 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Tastes a little hot, even though the official alcohol is only 14.7%, and that heated impression is compounded by blackberry flavors that veer into Porty raisins. Rich and dry, but a bit bitter in raisinskins."
France,93,55,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Vignobles K 2014 Badine de la Patache  (Pomerol),"The wine, with its firm tannins and solid structure, is still young. The hints of black-plum fruits are way behind the structure. That's all good, because this wine will come together well, to give a rich full wine with spice, juicy black fruits and acidity. Drink from 2020."
Italy,89,48,Sangiovese,red,Marchesato degli Aleramici 2009 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Aromas of mature plum, underbrush, coffee and toast lead the nose. The ripe palate offers dried cherry, coffee bean, and a hint of mocha while bracing tannins provide support. Drink through 2019."
US,89,18,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Clos LaChance 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),"This affordably priced bottling is quite solid for the cost, showing deep black cherry, blueberry, cedar shavings, tobacco leaf and ash, cocoa and slight bay leaf on the nose. Chalky tannins show first on the sip, and then unwind to offer blackberry fruit, woody pencil shavings and a decent density."
US,88,19,Chardonnay,white,Chehalem 2007 INOX Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"INOX—from the French inoxidable—is Chehalem's stainless steel-fermented Chardonnay, what some might label “naked” or “unwooded.” It is widely available and very appealing, with a tart, stony texture and bright, acid-driven fruit. Green apple and citrus are front and center in this vintage, with a steely spine of natural acid and virtually no residual sugar."
US,90,38,Riesling,white,Dunham 2016 Late Harvest Lewis Estate Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),This wine is a golden color that is showing some browning despite its youth. The aromas offer notes of marmalade and diesel. The flavors are concentrated and sugary sweet. It delivers plenty of enjoyment but seems advanced for its age. Enjoy it sooner than later.
US,90,49,Pinot Noir,red,MacPhail 2012 Pratt Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Wild strawberry, cardamom and clove vie for attention around boysenberry and blueberry ripeness. Intense oak dominates at first, before bowing down to the layers of soft violet and rose. Let this wine open or cellar it away until 2019."
US,88,15,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cannonball 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Deep color, vivid oak, smoky aromas, and rich clove and blackberry flavors. It's full bodied, smoothly tannic in texture and has a lingering finish."
US,92,32,Zinfandel,red,De Loach 2011 OFS Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Made from selected barrels of the winery's various vineyard sources, this bottling is one of the more powerful Zinfandels out there. It's concentrated in blackberries, cherries, currants and oak, with wonderfully complicating notes of grilled meat, black pepper, violets and mu shu plum sauce. The wine will undoubtedly age for many years, gradually shedding primary fruit and picking up sweeter notes."
France,85,7,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Barton & Guestier 2013 Réserve Sauvignon Blanc (Côtes de Gascogne),"A cool, fresh wine that is packed with crisp herbaceous flavors. It's as clean as a whistle and deliciously bright with lemon, pink grapefruit and gooseberry flavors. Drink now."
US,89,32,Chardonnay,white,Silver Mountain 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Elegant aromas of pan-seared apples, cream, chamomile, browned butter, sea-salt caramel, cinnamon and cider play into the lush nose of this bottling. The apple-butter character consumes the lush palate, settling into walnut oil and marzipan. It's a richer style, and very well put together."
US,94,60,Pinot Noir,red,Baxter 2013 Oppenlander Vineyard Whole Cluster Pinot Noir (Mendocino),"A wine made like this doesn't come along every day. It was 100% whole-cluster fermented with wild yeast and aged in all neutral barrels. Its rich, soothing and complex personality makes it perfect for a special occasion that involves something like roast quail, sauteed mushrooms or beef bourgignon. It has full body and layered aromas of black tea, ripe plums and cigar box, combined with both fruity and savory flavors and fine tannins."
US,83,13,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Bianchi 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey),"For those who like their white wines distinctly sweet, this tastes like apricot and orange jam, with the stimulating heat of alcohol."
US,89,50,Pinot Noir,red,Soléna 2008 Hyland Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"From the heart of Pinot Noir country, this iconic vineyard, originally planted in the 1970s, yields concentrated flavors of black cherry, root beer, incense and peppermint. Tart, juicy and quite young, this finishes with leaf and herb-infused tannins."
US,86,35,Merlot,red,Coquerel Family Wine Estates 2009 Merlot (Calistoga),"Oddly acidic and hard in the mouth for Merlot, a variety that's supposed to be soft and silky. You'll find black cherry flavors, but not enough to punch through the tannins. Doesn't seem capable of aging, so drink up."
France,89,17,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Les Vignerons de Tautavel Vingrau 2011 Syrousse Red (Côtes du Roussillon Villages),"A blend of 70% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 10% Carignan, this opens with skin-driven, black-fruit aromas and accents of savory herbs and forest floor. The medium-weight mouth offers gripping yet fine tannins and a decadent richness to the black cherry core."
US,87,42,Zinfandel,red,Phipps 2012 Treborce Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Aged for more than two years in French, American and Hungarian oak, this vineyard-designate is bombastically broad-shouldered in cocoa powder and leather, Soft and velvety on the palate, it finishes with a spark of heat."
US,90,68,Syrah,red,Cairdean Estate 2011 Syrah (Atlas Peak),"A majority varietal, this wine also contains Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, combining for a taste of baked blackberry and licorice, the oak subtle in smoke. With a tannic bite on the midpalate, it resolves into smoother, velvety textures on the finish, inviting one in for another try."
Italy,83,10,Pinot Grigio,white,Torresella 2001 Pinot Grigio (Veneto),"The color is very light, and so are the flavors. Although it lacks intensity, this faintly lemony wine is crisp, clean and moderately refreshing."
US,85,34,Merlot,red,Freemark Abbey 2012 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Light in weight and texture, this wine was aged in both French and American oak. Smokiness surrounds the otherwise restrained offerings of plum, dark cherry and herb."
France,84,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Le Bourdieu 2010  Médoc,"An obviously wood-aged wine, this shows a bitter toast character. The fruit is lean, struggling to show through the dark chocolate flavor. It has an austere finish, which is mitigated by its final acidity."
US,84,25,Zinfandel,red,Oakville Winery 2011 Estate Zinfandel (Oakville),"This drily austere Zinfandel tastes like it hardly got ripe. It's tough in acids and green tannins, with mint and sour cherry candy flavors. Oak helps to provide richness, but the cold vintage has taken its toll."
US,83,10,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Peltier 2013 Hybrid Sauvignon Blanc (Lodi),"Modest citrus, earth and almond notes come up from the glass, and continue in the flavors of this smooth, rounded, and straightforward wine. The balance is on the soft side, and the body is quite light."
US,82,28,Pinot Noir,red,Verve 2006 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Tastes raisiny, overripe and sweet in cherry jam flavor, with a harsh, peppery mouthfeel. Basically drinkable, but not going anywhere."
US,90,40,Merlot,red,J. Bookwalter 2012 Foreshadow Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Lighter in color, this blend of Conner Lee, Red Mountain Vineyard and Elephant Mountain fruit has aromas of freshly brewed coffee, dark chocolate, toasty barrel spices and red fruit, with the barrel notes taking the lead. It's silky-soft in feel, with generous raspberry flavors that show a pleasing sense of balance, all backed by a light squeeze of tannins."
US,86,10,Zinfandel,red,Dark Horse 2015 Zinfandel (California),A streak of vanilla winds through the almost-sweet fruit flavors of this medium-bodied and soft-textured wine. Ripe cherry aromas and strawberry jam flavors come with very little tannin and low acidity.
US,90,45,Chardonnay,white,La Crema 2015 Saralee's Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Opening with beautiful aromatics, this wine has a heady invitation of orange and apple blossom before revealing a sublime texture and rich oak. Pillowy on the palate, it offers Asian pear and apple flavors, with a slight confectionery quality of crème brûlée."
US,91,34,Pinot Noir,red,Morgan 2014 Twelve Clones Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Light raspberry, cranberry, pomegranate and strawberry fruit tones greet the nose on this bottling. The aromas then offer a brick-like minerality bolstered by chiseled slate and wet river stones. Flavors are also rocky and rusty, with lots of crushed gravel and turned earth giving complexity to the cran-pomegranate fruit."
US,90,23,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Kriselle 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Rogue Valley),"This effusive, expressive wine offers deep citrus, lemon drop, grapefruit and peach flavors. The fruit is further boosted with a powdered sugar note. Delicious already, it should drink well over the next three or four years."
Italy,91,50,Red Blend,red,Barone Ricasoli 2001 Casalferro Red (Toscana),"Here's a look at an older vintage of Casalferro (Sangiovese and Merlot) that showcases the aging potential of this super Tuscan blend. Ripe fruit and spice is backed by ethereal tones of cola, licorice, herbs and resin. The mouthfeel is characterized by dusty tannins and a crisp close."
US,86,18,Zinfandel,red,Artezin 2010 Zinfandel (Mendocino County),"A young Zin still in need of time to develop, there's an intensity of raspberry and blackberry fruit in this wine, and a softness throughout. It's full bodied, and its finish falls flat."
US,92,36,Pinot Noir,red,Ferrari-Carano 2013 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Good balance and vivid fruit flavors are the strong points of this well-put-together wine. Bright aromas like raspberries and red cherries are followed by rich but still attractively tangy flavors that ride on a very firm texture of fine tannins and appetizing acidity. This one will gain more complexity and interest with time, so it's best to drink after 2017."
US,87,45,Pinot Noir,red,Cellars 33 2011 Bacigalupi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a lighter-style wine, as Pinots from this vineyard, which is in a warm part of the valley, tend to be. But it's also a tasty Pinot, soft and supple, with cola, cherry jam, brown sugar, pie spice and sandalwood flavors. Drink now."
US,90,35,Chardonnay,white,Hopper Creek 2006 Los Chamizal Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"Very dry, crisp and minerally, a subtle wine with some bottle age that shows real complexity and finesse. Not for fruit-forward fans, its pineapple, pear and herb flavors are drying out, leading to interesting, old-wine, honey-and-cashew nuances. Drink right away, before it dies."
US,88,100,Syrah,red,Amalie Robert 2011 Top Barrel Syrah (Willamette Valley),"Firm and tart, this is a rather light, earthy, herbal take on the grape. Its blueberry and blue plum suggestions are bound in an unyielding frame, with a whiff of rubber ball on the nose."
France,92,45,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château les Grands Chênes 2014  Médoc,"Laden with wood as much as rich fruit, this is a fully structured wine. Dark toast is prominent at this young stage although this will go as the wine balances out. Then it will be a dense wine full of black fruits and with balanced tannins and acidity. Drink from 2021."
US,86,14,Chardonnay,white,Hoopes 2012 Hoopla Unoaked Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"A clear, ripe pear note rings through this medium-bodied Chardonnay from the aroma to the palate to the finish. Even the texture is a bit thick like pear juice, though there is some subtlety in the light vanilla and pastry cream accents."
France,90,40,Pinot Noir,red,Pierre Cornu Camus 2014 Les Charmières Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),"Packed with strawberry flavors, this ripe wine has plenty of the acidity typical of the vintage along with good fruitiness and structure. The wine is already developing well so drink from 2018."
US,89,22,Riesling,white,Bellwether 2014 Sawmill Creek Vineyard Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Delicate swathes of honey brighten savory chestnut, smoke and mineral tones throughout this feather-light dry Riesling. It's an earthier slightly darker expression of Riesling with electric acidity accenting hints of spice and dusty pollen. The finish is long and intently smoky."
US,92,50,Pinot Noir,red,Loring Wine Company 2014 Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Ripe red cherries and red currants provide the fruit scents for the savory smoked pork and sanguine raw-beef qualities that power the nose on this single-vineyard bottling. Those bloody meats mix with elderberry, ripe red plum, lavender and allspice once sipped, proving complex and tangy but with lingering dark-fruit flavors."
US,88,9,Zinfandel,red,"Salvatore Principe 2009 Take Flight, Artists Collection Limited Edition Zinfandel (Lodi)","For $9 a nice wine in a nice package, made from old-vine Zinfandel from Lodi. The red fruit on the nose pops out pleasantly followed by smooth tannins and a fruity, chocolaty mix of flavors."
France,90,56,Chardonnay,white,Nicolas Feuillatte 2006 Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"Based in the Côte des Blancs, Nicolas Feuillatte has access to some fine Chardonnay for this mineral-textured wine. Lightly perfumed with white flowers, it is crisp and fresh, with sliced apple and lemon right up front. The wine is fruity now and will age well. Either drink now or wait for more maturity from 2017."
US,87,13,Pinot Gris,white,Sawtooth 2015 Pinot Gris,"The pear, apple and apple skin aromas are light. The palate brings just off-dry pear flavors with a full feel."
Italy,86,21,Red Blend,red,Giuseppe Lonardi 2010  Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,"This selection opens with aromas of blackberry and black pepper, along with whiffs of oak and vanilla. It has a chewy palate, with well-integreated oak and a black-cherry core accented by a hint of chocolate. The finish is somewhat abrupt."
US,82,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Keating 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),"Made without oak, this wine is brisk with acidity, with citrus, gooseberry and white pepper flavors. A touch of ammonia makes it challenging."
Italy,90,50,Sangiovese,red,San Lorenzo 2009 Bramante  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Dark berry and baking spice aromas emerge from the glass and carry over to the juicy palate together with fleshy wild cherry, plum, black pepper, cinnamon and vanilla alongside big round tannins. Well balanced with great length, this poised wine already is accessible, so drink 2015–2019."
US,86,50,Pinot Noir,red,Belle Glos 2006 Clark & Telephone Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"The vineyard is in Santa Maria Valley and the wine's success is dependent on vintage conditions, just like in Burgundy. Past releases have varied widely. The '06 is right in the middle, a dry, silky wine with cherry, cola, crushed brown spice and anise flavors, but also with a heavy tug of baked fruit."
US,85,23,Chardonnay,white,Carlson Creek 2010 Chardonnay (Arizona),"A mix of peach and lychee aromas give an exotic edge. Full in body and fleshy, this is endowed with concentrated flavors and tense acids."
US,92,18,Sangiovese,red,Lauren Ashton Cellars 2011 Rosé of Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The Sangiovese comes from Red Willow Vineyard, and it would be hard to find a more lovely, elegant rosé from this side of the Atlantic. Light strawberry and melon aromas continue onto the palate, with pinpoint detail and precision."
US,91,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,White Rock Vineyards 2013 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Blackberry, cherry and plum notes form this estate wine's fruity core, complemented by an earthy thread of cedar, pencil and tobacco. Dry, firm tannins give it a structure that takes time to unwind, the finish marked by powerful grace and spicy clove."
US,90,16,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Emmolo 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"A great value. It's dry and crisp, just as Sauvignon Blanc should be, yet with a rich vein of honey. Shows savory citrus and tropical fruit, apricot, green grass, mineral, vanilla and white pepper flavors."
US,90,42,Red Blend,red,Sparkman 2006 Ruby Leigh Red Red (Red Mountain),"This nicely structured Bordeaux blend's aromas begin with violets and roll into cherry candy, while in the mouth the wine is sweet yet firm, with tart acids that are tightly wound. A mix of berry, cherry and cassis fruit is counterweighted with citric acids. Tannins are ripe with hints ofcut tobacco, moist earth and black olive."
US,92,39,Zinfandel,red,Occasio 2014 Del Arroyo Vineyard Zinfandel (Livermore Valley),"Bold and rich without feeling heavy, this luscious wine oozes with ripe blackberry and boysenberry fruit and has a mouth-coating, mouth-filling texture that keeps its flavors echoing through the finish. Occasio makes exceptional wines in small quantities."
US,92,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Walla Walla Vintners 2010 Sagemoor Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This sources grapes from the oldest (1972) blocks at Sagemoor, yielding a deep, rich and intense wine saturated with black cherry, cassis, licorice and barrel flavors. It's perfectly balanced, drinking beautifully, and fit for cellaring over a decade or longer."
US,87,29,Zinfandel,red,Mazzocco 2007 Briar Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A nice Zin made in Mazzocco's bold, ripe style, and since it's as good as their more expensive Zins, a comparative value. Shows massive flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, licorice and cola, leading to a dry, somewhat hot finish."
US,89,35,Pinot Noir,red,Windsor Oaks 2011 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This Pinot could certainly withstand a few years of aging, but there's really no reason to cellar it. It's all about rich, ripe, flamboyant fruit in the way of cherries, persimmons and raspberries. For all the forward fruitiness, the wine finishes dry and firm in acids and tannins."
US,90,20,Syrah,red,Arbor Crest 2004 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"As in 2003 this is a blend of Stillwater Creek and Sundance Vineyard fruit. Some complex aromas of cured meat and smoke are added to an underpinning of berry and currant fruit. This is a graceful wine that will need decanting, but well worth taking the extra time to see what it's all about. Retasted 24 hours after being opened, the wine had blossomed into full-blown flavor."
US,84,9,Syrah,red,Covey Run 2004 Quail Series Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This budget-priced Syrah offers hints of why the grape does so well in Washington. It has a bit of peppery bite, some very tart cranberry fruit, crisp acids and a lifted, citrusy finish. Clean and varietal, it's a good everyday effort."
US,87,40,Pinot Noir,red,Youngberg Hill Vineyards 2014 Bailey Block Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"The most recent planting at the estate vineyard gets its own designate. It's 100% Dijon 777 clone, and the flavors push stem and rock and forest floor front and center. For some tasters, that's enough; for others, a bit more actual fruit would be welcome. Right now it's a stiff, herbal wine that's already showing signs of drying out."
US,90,55,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Conn Valley 1997 Estate Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Meaty and also jammy, with popcorn and cedar aromas. Dry and complex, typical of the winery's style, and mildly astringent. The tannins are starching at this point, but should fade. Given time, the red fruit should emerge and conquer the youthful astringency."
Italy,87,16,Red Blend,red,La Ciarliana 2012  Rosso di Montepulciano,"Aromas include mature black fruit, violet, allspice and sage. The dense, extracted palate displays overripe black cherry, black pepper, and grilled sage alongside brooding tannins. It's robust and dense but not an ager, so drink soon."
US,88,34,Riesling,white,Millbrook 2013 Late Harvest Riesling (Hudson River Region),"Generous streaks of caramel and honey seem to glaze this delectably sweet late-harvest Riesling. It's lusciously ripe, dripping with autumnal flavors of freshly pressed apples and pears, but bright tangerine acidity offers balance."
Italy,88,19,Sangiovese,red,Salcheto 2012 Obvius  (Rosso di Montepulciano),"This opens with earthy underbrush, violet and red berry aromas. The palate is bright, with tart red cherry and ripe raspberry accented by notes of pepper and baking spice. It's vibrant and calls out for hearty pastas or pecorino cheese."
US,91,50,Red Blend,red,Saggi 2014 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is a blend of Sangiovese (52%), Cabernet Sauvignon (32%) and Syrah. Aromas of bittersweet chocolate, herb, pencil lead, smoke, cranberry and dark fruit lead to palate-coating black-fruit flavors that display depth and density. It shows a lovely sense of balance and detail."
US,86,120,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Goldschmidt 2004 PLUS Game Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"This is a much more oaky version of the winery's Game Ranch regular bottling, which was released two years ago. The original release was very ripe in fruit but very tannic. This one's the same, but plastered with new oak."
US,88,20,Chardonnay,white,Robert Mondavi 2014 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"This is a straightforward, lush and alluringly tart white that offers an oaky backbone of vanilla wrapped in fresh layers of fig, apple and green olive flavor."
France,91,16,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Vignerons de Tavel 2012 Les Hauts d'Acantalys Red (Lirac),"The Tavel cave cooperative also bottles wine from neighboring Lirac. This is an attractive, creamy-textured, supple wine that's ready to drink. Black cherries, dark chocolate and spice box notes finish soft and plush. Drink now–2019."
US,86,12,Pinot Gris,white,Château Bianca 2007 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Bright and tasting of ripe pear, this is a textural, tart, tangy wine nicely set up for pastas, light seafood and poultry. Despite the nominal residual sugar, it comes across as almost entirely dry, with just a hint of fruit sweetness."
US,91,28,Chardonnay,white,Gallo Family Vineyards 2004 Laguna Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"An interesting and complex Chard marked by intense minerality. Calls to mind Chablis in the acidity, dryness and racy taste of cold steel. Also in the flavor mix are tart green apples, pineapples, limes, cinnamon spice and creamy lees."
France,87,21,Chardonnay,white,Joseph Drouhin 2012 Domaine Drouhin-Vaudon  (Chablis),"This is a fresh while also rich wine. Yellow fruits are laced with appealing acidity and a crisp lemon zest texture. Lively, fruity and mineral, it is ready to drink."
US,84,12,Riesling,white,SeaGlass 2010 Riesling (Monterey County),The main thing to know about this Riesling is that It's quite sweet in oranges and pineapples. The all-important acidity is a little too soft for balance.
US,92,100,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Frias 2010 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"A near twin to the excellent 2006, and as ageable. It's a big wine, but immature, with scads of blackberry and cherry jam fruit, smoky new oak and stiff tannins. Give it eight years to let everything mellow together, and it should hold until at least 2020."
US,91,62,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Chateau Rollat 2011 Edouard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Aromas convey cedar, savory herb, earth, black licorice and cherry. The dark flavors are reserved in style but still display richness, supported by fine-grained tannins."
US,87,14,Riesling,white,Three Brothers 2014 2nd Degree Medium Sweet Riesling (Seneca Lake),"Crisp apple and pear aromas take a richer, riper turn towards melon and peach on the palate of this medium-sweet Riesling. Its juicy, fruity demeanor is straightforward and lush, but a punchy strike of lemon-lime acidity livens up the finish. Drink now."
France,87,32,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Haut la Pointe 2014  Côtes de Bourg,"With 24% Cabernet Franc, this is a perfumed wine packed with juicy fruit and a fine smoky character. It offers black currant flavors and youthful spiciness. Drink from 2019."
US,89,14,Pinot Gris,white,Wine by Joe 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Tight and bright, this tasty wine hits the mineral button under tangy lemon flesh and rind. The tart fruit is refreshing, clear and clean through a driving finish."
France,91,35,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine Laporte 2014 La Comtesse  (Sancerre),"Produced from vines located between Chavignol and Sancerre, this comes from pure chalk soil. It is crisp while having a warmer, more rounded character. It's full of apple and pineapple as well as citrus fruits which are added to the young, tight mineral texture. Aromatic and ripe, the wine should age a year or two and will be better from 2017."
France,96,400,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Mouton Rothschild 2013  Pauillac,"This generous, almost opulent wine has both concentration and rounded fruits. It's open already, hinting at wood-aging while concentrating much more on the ripe fruits. Packed with fruit and tannins, it's densely textured. It will age, of course; don't start to drink before 2025."
US,92,40,Red Blend,red,Paul Dolan 2005 Deep Red Red (Mendocino),"The descriptor Deep Red perfectly captures the essence of this blend of Petite Sirah, Zinfandel, Syrah and Grenache. It's rich and full-bodied, with expressive, complex red wine flavors of red and black currants, spiced red plums, crushed pepper and hints of dark chocolate and anise. The tannic structure is wonderfully soft and intricate. Drink this beautiful wine now and for the next several years."
France,93,24,Riesling,white,Boeckel 2014 Brandluft Riesling (Alsace),"Subdued, riper fruit has not yet come to the surface. Notions of Bramley apple are evoked on the nose; on the palate they show as the more rounded flavor of baked Bramley. Hovering above it all is grated lemon zest, pulling fruit, texture and freshness tautly together in a dry, fresh yet mellow finish. The more you taste, the more the still-underlying fruit yearns to rise to the surface. Best to give this some time so it can show its true, exciting colours."
US,87,24,Merlot,red,Waterbrook 2009 Reserve Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a bit lighter than the previous vintage, offering tart red-berry fruit, accented with a note of fresh herb. The chocolaty barrel accents smooth out the midpalate and lead into a pleasant finish."
France,94,150,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Le Dôme 2008  Saint-Émilion,"Smooth, perfumed and elegant, this Cabernet Franc-dominated wine has rounded tannins, layered acidity and a dark power of ripe tannins. It is both concentrated and fresh, a great combination."
France,84,17,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château La Fleur Beaumont 2011  Bordeaux Supérieur,"This is a wine that's on the lean side. That gives it structure without enough fruit to balance. It is dry, tight and shows black currant acidity at the end."
US,87,35,Zinfandel,red,EOS 2012 Algunas Dias Single Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Red fruits, barrel smoke and chipped slate make for an intriguing although not entirely integrated nose on this single-vineyard bottling. The palate shows red berries, wet clay and hints of anise."
France,91,35,Chardonnay,white,Antonin Rodet 2010 Château de Rully Saint Jacques Cuvée R. de Ternay  (Rully),"There is a fine mineral-driven backbone to this ripe, concentrated and fruity wine, which gives its dense apricot and pineapple flavors great structure. It needs to age for at least four years."
US,90,20,Zinfandel,red,Mettler Family Vineyards 2013 Epicenter Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"The spicy, oaky aromas are obvious and fun, leading to fully ripe flavors like blackberry jam in this full-bodied, deeply colored and velvet-textured wine. It's big but smooth, and the oak influence is welcome, adding interest and complexity."
US,92,42,Pinot Noir,red,TR Elliott 2008 Burgonet Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a deeply flavored, earthy wine. You'll find rich raspberry and cherry fruit, but also a mushroomy taste, as well as intense baking spices. Impressively complex, it's fairly tannic, and seems immature. Give it 4–5 years in a good cellar."
US,82,20,Pinot Noir,red,Kyra 2008 Pinot Noir (Washington),"Oxidized and tawny, a blend of grapes from Okanogan, Columbia Valley and Columbia Gorge. Soft and generic, with lots of vanilla and clove."
US,88,30,Chardonnay,white,Januik 2015 Cold Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine offers light pear, citrus, cream and lees aromas. The palate is broad and lightly creamy in feel, lacking only a bit of concentration."
US,84,22,Syrah,red,Waterstone 2005 Syrah (Napa Valley),"This Syrah was grown in Carneros in the cool, long '05 vintage, which may explain its minty sharpness, despite the low case production level. You'll find enough cherry fruit and new French oak to make it fairly rich, but that sharp green tang remains."
Italy,87,10,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Feudo Arancio 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sicilia),"This opens with aromas of black cherry, chocolate, prune and blackberry jam. Freshness and subtle softness picks up on the rear of the wine."
France,96,115,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Lynch-Bages 2005  Pauillac,"Classic Lynch-Bages with just a bit of extra power and richness. While the tannins are structured, it is the velvety fruit that rolls around the mouth that is the most dominant character. It is coming together into a wine that will be big and dense, but never over the top."
Italy,91,39,Red Blend,red,Badia a Coltibuono 2010 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Made with Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo, Colorino and Ciliegiolo, this boasts an alluring aroma of red berry, fragrant iris, anise, underbrush and a balsamic note. The bright palate offers ripe black cherry, menthol, baking spice, grilled herb and a tobacco note. It's nicely balanced, with ripe tannins and freshness. Drink through 2020."
US,84,46,Syrah,red,Lorenzi Estate 2009 Reserve Syrah (Temecula Valley),"This Syrah starts off earthy, musky, big and brawny and can't escape the wood-oaked herbal greenness on the finish. It's simply too high in alcohol."
US,89,20,Riesling,white,Sineann 2012 Riesling (Willamette Valley),"A sweet, slightly sugary Oregon Riesling that gives a gentle nod to the German Kabinett style. The low (8%) alcohol is the tip-off. The delicate, floral aromas and light stone-fruit flavors make this an ideal summer sipping wine."
US,86,14,Chardonnay,white,Irony 2013 Small Lot Reserve Chardonnay (Monterey County),"Very light in color, this wine has a pungent nose that features white flowers, cold steel and lime juice. The palate is bright with racy acidity, showing lots of honeysuckle, some ripe green apples and hints of honeydew and kiwi."
US,87,29,Red Blend,red,Vixen NV The Villain Red (Santa Barbara County),"This bistro-style red is dry and lusty in cherry, tobacco and spice flavors. The winery has not revealed what varieties are in it, but it tastes like a juicy, old-fashioned field blend, and will go well with a range of fare."
US,85,52,Syrah,red,Olson Ogden 2006 Stagecoach Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),"Too soft and sugary sweet for a dry table wine, although the cherry, blackberry and chocolate flavors are decadently delicious. Needs dryness and greater structural integrity."
Italy,88,17,Chardonnay,white,Andriano 2009 Somereto Chardonnay (Alto Adige),"You really can't beat the purity and liveliness of this luminous Chardonnay. This is a pure expression of the grape in its essence. The nose shows little sign of winery intervention and the mouthfeel is creamy and rich in a very understated, elegant way."
US,88,42,Merlot,red,Adamant Cellars 2012 Winemaker's Select Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"All varietal coming from Dwelley and Minnick Hills vineyards, this wine leads with aromas of black licorice, dates and green herbs. There's plenty of richness to the flavors, which are backed by a squeeze of grainy tannins."
US,90,21,Zinfandel,red,Murphy-Goode 2013 Liar's Dice Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"With sizable yet soft tannins firmly in place, this wine unleashes substantial flavors of raspberry and prosciutto-wrapped fig. Its seamless texture is dotted in vanilla and smoky meat, ending with plush, round knots of blackberry pie."
US,90,18,Riesling,white,Brigadoon 2016 Riesling (Willamette Valley),"One quarter of this Riesling was aged in neutral barrels, the rest in stainless steel, finishing at just 10 g/L of residual sugar to yield a round, racy palate of fresh herb, apple and melon flavors. A subtle note of butter and spice emerges as the finish winds down."
US,84,50,Pinot Noir,red,"Greenwood Ridge 2013 Hundred Point, Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)","This medium-bodied wine has an earthy aroma, muted cherry flavors and a smooth enough texture. It is good and drinkable."
France,87,22,Chardonnay,white,Corinne et Pierre Grossot 2010  Chablis,"This is rich with flavors of yellow fruit and ripe pear. It has a good texture, with crisp, citrusy acidity that adds a lively edge to this ripe wine. While it's already drinkable, give this another six months of aging."
US,85,15,Riesling,white,Airfield Estates 2011 Riesling (Yakima Valley),"The 2011 vintage created wines with underripeness and low alcohol, and this Riesling attempts to cut the sourness with its 2.4% residual sugar. It comes across as a mix of lemon juice, orange juice, and simple sweetness."
US,83,11,Riesling,white,St. Clair NV Riesling (New Mexico),"New Mexico and Riesling seem an unlikely combination but it works in this wine. Scents of almond, apricot and freesia lead to a slightly sweet palate that winds down to a short, soft finish. Drink up."
US,92,48,Pinot Noir,red,Merry Edwards 2001 Klopp Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"From the southern, cooler part of the valley, but on a sunny ridge above the fog, a fascinating study in contrasts. It has brilliantly crisp, citrusy acidity, but is a fat, fleshy wine, with mouthwatering flavors of black cherries, cola, mocha and gingersnap. The scour of dusty tannins on the finish suggests this wine will hold for several years."
Italy,88,24,Red Blend,red,Fattoria San Felo 2011 Dicioccatore Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano),"Aromas of spiced plum, coffee, toast and vanilla lead the nose on this blend of Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. The palate delivers dried black cherry, roasted coffee bean, black pepper and licorice alongside brooding, tongue-drying tannins. Drink 2016–2021."
US,87,35,Chardonnay,white,Bedell 2015 Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),"Toast and dill accent zesty green apple and lemon flavors in this lithe, sharply composed Chardonnay. Fresh acidity abounds on the palate, leading a moderately long, slightly tart finish. Drink now through 2019."
US,86,11,Zinfandel,red,Goats Trail 2007 Zinfandel (California),"This is a good, everyday Zin with some extra features of fanciness. It's dry and tannic and full-bodied, the way you want Zin to be, with modest flavors of cherries, currants, mint, pepper and tobacco."
US,85,45,Pinot Noir,red,Churchill Cellars 2013 Burke Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine is quite clear in the glass and a touch tart on the palate, finding its way to a full-bodied, slightly flabby and gummy texture and sense of heaviness."
US,94,72,Pinot Noir,red,Donum 2011 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"The deep, dark color matches the deep, rich fruit and oak aromas, and the ripe, resounding dark cherry and cola flavors that follow. This is powerful, full-bodied Pinot Noir for a special occasion, maybe now, but there is no hurry. Should improve through 2020."
US,84,9,White Blend,white,Kumbaya 2010 White (California),"The varietal mix of this wine, which is undisclosed on the label, doesn't matter. All you need to know is that it's slightly sweet, soft and simple in citrus, pear and honeysuckle flavors."
US,92,40,Chardonnay,white,Okapi 2013 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Big, rich and rewarding, this wine opens with a bouquet of honeysuckle and apple blossom. It offers high acidity and robust oak in equal, complementary measure, as melon, apple and caramel flavors weigh in the smoothly textured palate."
France,92,45,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Château Maucoil 2013 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"Maucoil's 2013 is a sturdy, full-bodied wine. It's plummy, dense and earthy, with nuances of cracked pepper and mocha showing themselves on the palate. The finish—long, firm and peppery—bodes well for aging. Drink now–2025."
US,88,18,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Brutocao 1997 Brutocao Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino),"An estate-bottled, unfiltered 100% Cabernet, it’s an open, loose-knit wine, with soft, plummy fruit, some vanilla-cream notes and a sweet finish."
US,92,52,Pinot Noir,red,Siduri 2011 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Raw-boned, aggressive in tannins and powerful in fruit, in the manner of a young Garys' Pinot. While it's not ready to drink, it does show commanding flavors of black cherries, currants, cola and mushrooms that aren't going anywhere anytime soon. Try drinking it after 2016."
Italy,90,125,Red Blend,red,Zenato 2007 Sergio Zenato Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"This muscular Amarone has an almost overripe fragrance, along with chocolate and vanilla notes. The alcohol is forward on the palate, but it also delivers sweet plum, prune and black pepper flavor, with hints of vanilla and coffee. This is direct and powerfully structured."
US,86,25,Pinot Noir,red,Artesa 2010 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Cheerful, easy-to-like and silky, this Pinot Noir has clean raspberry and cherry tart flavors. It has good acidity, and a long, spicy finish."
US,89,32,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,L'Ecole No. 41 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Hailing from 11 different vineyards located across the Columbia Valley, this appealing, 100% varietal wine provides aromas of toasty spices, dried herbs, cocoa and jammy dark fruit. The cranberry, coffee and blackberry flavors are sweet and focused, backed by chewy, lightly dry tannins that need time to soften."
US,92,42,Merlot,red,Frazier 2008 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This is a great Napa Valley Merlot, from a winery with a generally good track record with the variety. The grapes were grown in the Coombsville region, although they were allowed to get very ripe, resulting in fairly high alcohol and rich cherry, berry, dark chocolate and anise flavors. It's notable for grippy tannins that give it a firm, dry mouthfeel."
US,94,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Laurel Glen 2013 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Mountain),"This is a bright, engaging and vibrant 100% varietal wine, lovely in currant, cranberry and a sanguine earthiness. The acidity is weaved throughout and entirely supportive, uplifting the fruit to greater heights of freshness and focus."
US,88,30,Syrah,red,Januik 2014 Weinbau Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"This leads with light raspberry, plum, vanilla and barrel spice aromas. The palate is lighter still, mixing fruit and barrel qualities in equal proportion and finishing on a baking spice note. The oak is a little intense."
US,83,18,Zinfandel,red,Bianchi 2009 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"With enormously high alcohol, this Zin tastes as sweet as a dessert wine. It's soft and simple, with raspberry and cherry flavors."
France,90,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Donjon de Bruignac 2014 Premium  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"The wine is ripe and smooth with a fine balance between acidity and the red fruits. It is light on tannins, concentrating on the fruitiness. The aftertaste with its spice is dense and ripe. Drink from 2017."
US,93,50,Pinot Noir,red,La Fenêtre 2007 Calmant Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Feels a bit thick and heavy now, with jammy raspberry, cherry, mocha and sandalwood flavors, but so good, so pure that a few years in the cellar have to benefit. A splendid acid-tannin balance provides the framework for aging. Better after 2011."
US,94,175,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Terlato 2010 Episode Red (Napa Valley),"Terlato has mastered the art of crafting Bordeaux-style red wines that scream Napa Valley. The style is the modern one of exceptional ripeness, softness and sweetness, generously oaked and slightly high in alcohol. Here, you'll find deep flavors of blackberries, mocha, black currants, olives and toast. It's ready to drink now, and should develop in the bottle for at least 10 more years."
US,88,15,Red Blend,red,Church & State 2014 Lost Inhibitions I Don't Care Who's Watching Red (California),"Dried-fruit flavors of prune and raisin lend a very ripe, dense richness to this high-powered full-bodied wine. It has good supportive acidity and tannins to balance out the extreme ripeness."
US,94,65,Pinot Noir,red,Arbor Brook 2014 Vintner's Select Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"The term Vintner's Select, which is unregulated, can be abused. Here it really means something, as this is the winery's top cuvée—an excellent effort that spent 18 months in oak. There's extra depth in the cherry and cassis fruit, packing a powerful, compact punch all the way through a long, polished finish."
France,87,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Cave du Marmandais 2013 Château la Bastide Sauvignon Blanc (Côtes du Marmandais),"Grapes from the vines around the 13th-century castle of La Bastide are sent to the Marmandais co-op for a separate bottling. This smooth and ripe wine shows plenty of rich mango and apricot flavors cut by lime acidity that gives a lift of freshness. Drink now, although the wine will age until 2018."
US,87,12,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Firebrix 2013 Vineyard Selection The Fresh Market Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is straight down the Cabernet fairway with aromas and flavors of black and green olive, plum, herbs, mocha and pencil lead. It's soft in feel with a pinch of sugar stitching it all together."
US,90,18,Pinot Noir,red,Oregon Territory 2015 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"As in 2014, this budget label from Paul O'Brien winery is a stunning value in an Oregon Pinot Noir. A total of 20% of the fruit was sourced from the Willamette Valley, and all was barrel aged for 10 months in 25% new French oak. Concentrated raspberry and cherry fruit is complemented with streaks of earth and bark. The texture is compelling, and the stiff tannins will continue to soften up over the next decade or so."
US,89,85,Chardonnay,white,Del Dotto 2010 Cinghiale Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"A rich effort, this offers ripe pear, citrus and tropical fruit flavors. Interesting notes of mushrooms and dried fruits are beginning to emerge, although that might indicate the wine's limited ageability. Drink over the next 1–2 years."
US,87,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Apex 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas of cocoa, baking spice and herb are followed by cocoa and vanilla-speckled flavors. The tannins bring a slight sense of astringency but overall it offers some appeal."
US,86,48,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Bonneau 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"This is an easy-drinking Cab for enjoying now. It's soft and fruit-forward, bursting with ripe, oak-tinged cherry and raspberry jam flavors."
US,86,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Glen Manor 2009 Hodder Hill Red (Virginia),"The primary aroma of raw game creates an assertively meaty nose, with underlying tones of char, brown spice and black fruit. Medium to full bodied, it feels open upon entrance before firming up on the midpalate. A note of spiced blackberry jam lingers on the finish with some warmth."
US,84,18,Chardonnay,white,Chatham 2012 Church Creek Oak Chardonnay (Virginia's Eastern Shore),"Lemon curd and artificial butter show on the nose and palate, with underripe peach adding verve to a creamy body."
US,93,43,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Baer 2009 Arctos Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Bordeaux-style blend is Baer's top wine. A bright bouquet of violet, berry, pepper and stone greets you at first sniff, and it gets better and better from there. Dark fruits weave through a supple and striated flavor palette, long and detailed."
US,92,35,Pinot Noir,red,Elizabeth Chambers 2014 Winemaker's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Tasted alongside the 2013, this is bigger, bolder, fruitier and more powerful, yet a touch less refined. The strawberry and cherry fruit is underscored with a pleasing minerality. The tannins are substantial and in proportion. A hint of chicken stock runs through the finish."
France,89,25,Red Blend,red,Georges Vigouroux 2005 Château de Mercuès Red (Cahors),"Power is the best word to describe this solidly structured wine. Its tannins are dominant at this stage, giving a dense, dry core to the rich black fruits and bitter chocolate. The final adds on appealing black currant perfumes."
US,93,52,Pinot Noir,red,Cellars 33 2013 Keefer Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a terrific representation of all that is spectacularly specific about Keefer Ranch, a relatively cool site for grapes in Green Valley. Earthy and spicy in clove and nutmeg, the wine is layered in cranberry and crisp cherry. It's supple and silky on the palate, with an earthy oomph to the finish."
US,88,27,Merlot,red,Huston 2013 Merlot,Pleasing aromas of raspberry jam and spice lead to soft plump raspberry and cranberry flavors. It's fruit forward and brings a lot of enjoyment.
US,82,43,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Macari 2004 Bergen Road Red (North Fork of Long Island),"This medium-bodied Bordeaux blend features deep spice, pepper and red cherry flavors. It's a soft wine with gentle tannins and a subtle overall character."
France,82,24,Chardonnay,white,Manciat-Poncet 2014  Pouilly-Fuissé,"A candy-flavored wine, this is soft and missing acidity. Some spiced apple flavors are masked by the sherbet flavor."
US,87,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Owl Ridge 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County),"This sturdy, well-made wine has lightly charred aromas, tasty cherry flavors and moderate tannins to give the texture some grip."
US,82,12,Zinfandel,red,Masterpiece 2012 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"With sugary blackberry and prune flavors, this tannic Zinfandel is pretty simple. It will pair well with burgers, tacos and barbecue."
Italy,88,48,Red Blend,red,Abbazia Santa Anastasia 2003 Montenero Red (Sicilia),"This is a luminous, mature red wine with thick concentration and huge—almost too much—emphasis on toasted oak. Aromas recall vanilla, spice and coffee, although you will find blueberry and cherry on the finish: It is a blend of Nero d'Avola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot."
US,91,30,Sangiovese,red,Acorn 2013 Alegria Vineyards Sangiovese (Russian River Valley),"This lovely wine is balanced in tannin and acidity. Nutty, it has a touch of leather underlying the savory's fruit's baked quality, a mix of cinnamon, nutmeg and warmth. Aged in Hungarian, French and American oak, little of it new, the fruit is allowed to speak and effortlessly charm."
US,86,13,Red Blend,red,Lone Birch 2015 Red (Yakima Valley),"A blend of six different varieties with Merlot and Syrah taking the lead, this wine brings aromas of toast, matchstick and cherry. The flavors are luscious and full, backed by lightly tacky tannins."
Italy,87,18,Red Blend,red,Agricoltori del Chianti Geografico 2010 Contessa di Radda  (Chianti Classico),"This offers red currant, black cherry and chocolate flavors, with a hint of green pepper. It's round and accessible, with soft tannins."
US,90,18,Zinfandel,red,Paul Dolan 2005 Zinfandel (Mendocino-Amador),"This is really a lovely Zin. It has the weight, tannic structure and complexity of a fine Napa Cabernet, but the flavors are all Zinfandel. They include black pepper, red and black cherries and raspberries, currants, sweet tobacco, gingerbread and smoky oak influences."
US,89,18,Zinfandel,red,Castoro Cellars 1998 Vineyard Tribute Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"This is a slightly more intense version of the regular Castoro bottling, with an extra punch to the berries and a little more zip in the finish. A clean, bright, focused wine, precise and polished, with a natural elegance. Good balance throughout."
France,89,75,Chardonnay,white,De Venoge 2000 Brut Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (Champagne),"A fine, mineral-textured wine, crisp with lemon juice acidity and well integrated with green apple flavors. It has developed attractively, with weight in the right places."
US,87,12,Red Blend,red,Fenestra NV True Red Lot 26 Red (California),"This is an easy-drinking blend of many red varieties from a Livermore-based producer who loves both Rhône and Portuguese reds. This is soft and lightly spiced, with cola and cherry notes on the finish. A very good wine for a barbecue or a tailgate."
US,82,10,Riesling,white,Madroña 2001 Riesling (El Dorado),"Quite viscous, with creamy peach, melon and pear flavors at its core. An odd mineral note sticks out, though, while the finish could use a touch more acidity."
US,86,13,Chardonnay,white,Fleur 2010 Chardonnay (North Coast),"A solid Chardonnay, this is dry, rich and creamy, with lemon, lime and tropical fruit flavors. A touch of oak brings a nice note of buttered toast."
US,88,61,Pinot Noir,red,C. Donatiello 2006 Maddie's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is the richest of the winery's Pinots, and it shows a blast of pie-filling cherries, black raspberries, pomegranates and red plums, along with savory spice and vanilla oak flavors. It's a bit soft, but supported by finely ground, velvety tannins. Best now and through 2010."
France,88,25,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Isabelle et Pierre Clément 2015 La Dame de Châtenoy  (Menetou-Salon),"The wine is rich, accenting tropical-fruit flavors as well as concentrated acidity. Its spice and tangy character are part of the wine's intensity. This superripe wine is still on the young side and will be better from 2018."
US,95,240,Syrah,red,Silverback 2011 Reserve Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Density is a hallmark of all the Silverback reds, and this is the biggest of them all. It's packed tight and almost impenetrable until it's had several hours of breathing time. A mouthful of black fruits is set amidst a sea of darker flavors: tar, smoke, charcoal, graphite, cacao, licorice and espresso grounds. Put this one aside for up to a decade."
US,88,45,Zinfandel,red,Romililly 2012 Monte Rosso Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"There's a stewy rustiness to this wine on the entry, an evocative recall of the old country, when grandfather made wine in his basement. From a high-elevation vineyard site, it takes time to open. Once it does, the full-bodied expression of juicy blackberry and leather combine to nice effect."
France,96,400,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Mouton Rothschild 2014  Pauillac,"The label of this vintage is designed by David Hockney in memory of Philippine de Rothschild. It is a powerful wine in the rich style of Mouton with strong black-currant fruits from 81% Cabernet Sauvignon. It is dense and dark, ready to age for many years. Drink this impressive wine from 2026."
US,88,10,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"With the largest production in the entire Northwest, it is important that this wine express clean, varietal flavors with characteristic brightness and focus. And it does. Lightly herbal, fresh and clean, its fruit flavors suggest lemongrass, orange and ripe apple. Excellent balance and persistence"
France,87,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Bonnet 2008  Bordeaux,"Always a great value, this warm and fruity wine is immediately accessible and drinkable. It has fine red berry fruits, a good core of tannins and just the right fruit acidity. Drink now."
US,89,95,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Bennett Lane 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Feels awkward in the mouth now, with hard tannins and tart acids. However, it has an attractive richness of blackberries and cassis, enhanced with rich oak. It's a classically youthful Cabernet that should develop with 3–5 years in the bottle."
US,94,55,Pinot Noir,red,Boheme 2014 English Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Pine needles, rhubarb and strawberry wrap around a depth of fresh earth and rose petals in this medium-bodied and well-integrated wine. As it reveals fully developed layers of fruit and nuanced texture, it sizzles in white pepper, a twist of intrigue that differentiates this wine."
US,88,20,Red Blend,red,Carlotta 2008 Aran & David's Red (California),"This is a firmly tannic, full-bodied wine whose dark berry and stone fruit flavors are sprinkled with lots of black pepper. A blend of Sangiovese, Syrah and Petite Sirah, it's completely dry, with complex blackberry, black currant and leather flavors, and a hint of superripe raisins. Drink now."
US,88,13,Zinfandel,red,Sobon Estate 2014 Old Vine Zinfandel (Amador County),"Very ripe, very fruity and practically oozing across the palate, this full-bodied and very fairly priced wine tastes sweet and lightly tangy. The berry and plum flavors are quite concentrated, keeping the wine focused on fruit and freshness."
Italy,92,25,Red Blend,red,Torre Mora 2012 Scalunera  (Etna),"Initially shy, after a little time in the glass this offers up aromas of red berry, fragrant blue flower, menthol, leather, herb and baking spice. The concentrated palate doles out wild cherry, mocha, raspberry, pipe tobacco and a mineral note framed in velvety tannins and fresh acidity. Drink through 2022."
US,89,24,Chardonnay,white,Columbia Crest 2014 Reserve Estate Unoaked Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"There's plenty of nuance and detail on this concrete-aged wine, with its baked apple and spice aromas and flavors. It shows a fine sense of elegance and balance."
US,91,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Mount Eden Vineyards 2010 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Slightly funky scents of asphalt and sweaty socks come along with graphite, pressed blackberry and New Mexico chile. The palate is led by tobacco-laced zing, opening with boysenberry flavors, and finishing with decent acidity and mouth-coating tannins."
US,88,20,Riesling,white,Dunham 2014 Lewis Estate Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas bring generous notes of botrytis, chamomile, flowers, peach, ale and green apple. It drinks off dry, with well-balanced stone fruit and floral flavors that linger."
France,88,24,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Michel Goubard 2015 Mont-Avril  (Côte Chalonnaise),"This aromatic wine is delicious Pinot Noir. With fine ripe red fruits that are shot through with tannins for aging and crisp acidity for refreshing drinking, this is a rich wine that should be drunk now."
US,85,25,Pinot Noir,red,Mossback 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Sharp in acidity, and not entirely ripe, with a wintergreen mint zest to the cherries. Needs a rich, well-marbled steak to soften it."
US,87,26,Chardonnay,white,Lawer 2012 Three Coins Betsy's Vineyard Cannon Block Chardonnay (Knights Valley),"This Chardonnay is tight and concentrated, with ample acidity and flavors of citrus, peach, apricot and tropical fruit. There's a hint of minerality, and the finish is touched with toast and vanilla. Don't drink it too cold."
US,92,65,Merlot,red,Brave & Maiden 2012 Estate Limited Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),"Brooding on the nose, this bottling by a newer producer shows crushed herbs, slate, leathery blackberry and blueberry fruit, smoked meats and a touch of minty tobacco. There is great structure on the palate, with fine-grained, chalky tannins presenting blackberry fruit, black-pepper spice, oak smoke and touches of crushed oregano."
US,90,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Provenance Vineyards 2009 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Fierce in tannins, with a sandpapery astringency, this wine has oak that sticks out with sweet, smoky toast. The blackberry and cassis flavors are ripe and pleasing. All the parts haven't come together, so your best bet is to stick it in the cellar and see what happens."
US,87,15,Chardonnay,white,Cameron Hughes 2012 Lot 427 Chardonnay (Carneros),"Lots of rich flavors in this affordably priced Chard. It brims with golden mango, orange jam, buttercream, butterscotch, glazed donut and caramel flavors, finished with zesty acidity."
US,90,100,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Oakville East 2013 Exposure Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"A dryness of tannin leans into bitter notes of tobacco before mellowing on the palate to allow for crisper, more balanced aspects of cranberry, currant and plum to weigh in. A lightness to the palate belies this wine's ripeness."
US,88,16,Chardonnay,white,Caricature 2014 Chardonnay (Lodi),"Richness and near-sweetness are the main personality traits of this full-bodied and quite viscous wine. With oodles of ripe pear, peach and vanilla flavors, it should be great with aged cheeses and fruit desserts."
France,88,19,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Fourcas Dupré 2012 Zenith de Fourcas Dupré  (Listrac-Médoc),"This is the second wine of Fourcas Dupré. It is soft, full of ripe berry fruits and attractive acidity. The core of the wine is still dry and shows plenty of tannic structure that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2019."
US,86,12,Sangiovese,red,Waterbrook 2006 Rosé Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This light rosé is scented with rosewater, melon and strawberry. Finished dry and nicely structured."
US,88,21,White Blend,white,Murrieta's Well 2012 The Whip White (Livermore Valley),"A full-bodied white blend composed largely of Chardonnay with smaller percentages of Gewürztraminer, Sauvignon Blanc, Orange Muscat, Viognier, Pinot Blanc, Sémillon and Muscat Canelli. The aromas and flavors lean tropical, ensconced in crisp vanilla and lemon-lime. A versatile wine for a myriad of foods. Rich seafood dishes will work particularly well."
France,84,10,Chardonnay,white,Patriarche Père et Fils 2016 Chardonnay (Vin de France),"This is a soft, rounded wine with floral aromas and a line of citrusy acidity. Its light tang gives it a crisp aftertaste."
France,88,30,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Carcanieux 2013  Médoc,"This smooth, ripe wine offers attractive black-currant fruits. It is spicy, with balanced layers of wood along with acidity and a juicy aftertaste. The structure is there, although the fruit dominates. Drink from 2017."
US,88,58,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Canoe Ridge 2010 Block 1 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"All coming from a single block of the winery's estate vineyard, this is a 100% varietal, aged in half new French oak. It's drinking young with reticent notes of olive, coffee, boysenberry and cherry. The acids are quite tart—taking days to settle down—buffeted by firm, gritty tannins."
France,96,215,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine des Lambrays 2014  Clos de Lambrays,"This is such a perfumed wine with deceptively soft tannins and great fruit. The acidity is classic for the vintage, with raspberries and intense freshness at the end. It has a fine line of tannins and a life that will go far. Drink from 2022."
US,91,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Atmosphere 2008 Bismark Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"The vineyard, high in the Mayacamas Mountains, is famous for the tannic quality of its red wines. You'll find this '08 Cab tough and astringent. But you'll also easily discover the vast richness of chocolate, cherry, blackberry and currant fruit, so deep and impressive, and the finish is totally dry and balanced. This Cabernet clearly needs time. Give it until 2014 to begin to come around."
Italy,87,50,Sangiovese,red,Lazzeretti 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,"This shy, robust red reveals faint whiffs of underbrush, leather and Mediterranean brush. The subdued, one-dimensional palate offers raisin and licorice flavors, an alcoholic warmth and brawny tannins."
US,89,60,Pinot Noir,red,Brys 2012 Artisan Series Pinot Noir (Old Mission Peninsula),"As the top tier wine from this producer, this Pinot sees 10 months in new French oak which gives an inital char to the nose. With time in the glass this opens with notes of coffee-dusted red and black cherries. The medium-bodied palate is round and creamy in feel, with fuzzy, crushed-velvet tannins giving texture to the ripe cherry and racy currant flavors. A dusting of cocoa closes the finish."
US,92,15,Riesling,white,Kiona 2012 Late Harvest Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"As with Kiona's off-dry Washington Riesling, this includes a bit of Gewürztraminer, a clever addition that brings some spiciness into play. Intensely aromatic, the wine is almost Muscat-like, with dense orange peel flavors, along with citrus, tea and madeleine cookie. This is a sensational value from a leading Riesling producer."
France,89,36,Chardonnay,white,Chanson Père et Fils 2014 Premier Cru  (Montagny),"This is a fruity wine with lively acidity and a brisk, zingy character. Freshness shoots through the wine, making it lively with hints of yellow fruits. The aftertaste is crisp and ripe."
US,84,17,Chardonnay,white,Mill Creek 2006 Estate Chardonnay (Dry Creek Valley),"Here's an everyday, country-style Chardonnay with good enough flavors of tropical fruits and smoky vanilla oak, and a nicely creamy texture, to satisfy."
US,90,45,Pinot Noir,red,Marguerite-Ryan 2000 Sara Jean's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Pretty cedar, spice, cherry, herb, chocolate and anise flavors are smoothly integrated. It's rich and dynamic on the palate, a mix of creamy smooth texture and firm acidity that adds interest. Long on the finish."
US,87,30,Pinot Noir,red,Portlandia 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Light flavors call up notes of toasted cracker and raspberry candy that are pleasant enough, but insubstantial. The addition of 3% Syrah to the blend may have helped to bump up the color, but this remains a rather thin and simple, quaffable wine."
US,85,10,Chardonnay,white,Castle Rock 2014 Chardonnay (Central Coast),"There's quite a showy, fragrant nose on this widely available bottling, with apple blossoms, tuberose and a touch of quinine. The palate also takes on a gin-and-tonic character, powered by lime juice, white peach and botanical notes."
US,92,48,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,JR Wine 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Quite a good young Cab, deeply flavored in red and black currants, plums, chocolate and oak. Has a weight, density and balance that feel important and authoritative. Not an ager, but epitomizes a delicious Napa Cab to drink now."
US,86,16,Riesling,white,Buttonwood Grove 2015 Riesling (Finger Lakes),Straightforward flavors of pressed apple and lemon are slicked with honey and spice in this light off-dry Riesling. It's not a deeply persistent wine but the finish is refreshingly citrusy.
US,85,15,Red Blend,red,Tie-Dye 2014 Red (North Coast),Substantial fruit flavors and a lightly sweet balance give this medium- bodied wine a decent drinkability factor. The mouthfeel is slightly tannic and the finish is brief.
US,90,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Januik 2012 Weinbau Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Wahluke Slope),"Coming from a vineyard best known for its Cabernet Franc, this wine offers aromas of fresh herbs, coffee, cherry and bittersweet chocolate. Cherry and chocolate flavors play well off of each other, with the finish lingering. The barrel influence plays a prominent role."
Italy,90,65,Red Blend,red,Argentiera 2013  Bolgheri,"A blend of predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot with 10% Cabernet Franc, this opens with black-skinned berry, scorched earth and cooking spice aromas. The concentrated palate delivers black currant, mocha and licorice flavors with a hint of black pepper, all set against a backdrop of fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2021."
US,87,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Bonair 2005 Morrison Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rattlesnake Hills),"A step up from the '04, this is a better showcase for the cassis, blackberry and black cherry fruit from this old vine site. The balance of fruit, acid and tannin is in good proportion, and the wine is taut and slightly earthy, in a good way. The flavors gather strength and show signs of fleshing out as the wine breathes a bit."
US,93,24,Zinfandel,red,Seghesio 2010 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"You could use this as a teaching tool for classic Sonoma County Zinfandel. It's full-bodied, dry and spicy, with briary flavors of wild berries, mocha, tobacco, leather and exotic spices. More importantly, it's absolutely delicious. The grapes come from Seghesio's best vineyards in the Alexander and Dry Creek valleys. At this price, it's an astonishing value, especially considering that production was nearly 80,000 cases."
US,93,42,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Stevens 2008 XY Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),"The sixth release of this outstanding reserve holds firm to the well-established style. Bright, tart, ripe and compact red-berry fruit is set against firm, polished tannins. Still young and hard, it needs plenty of breathing time, or better yet, cellar it for a few years. Tim Stevens's reds have proven ageworthy, and this earthy, smoky, textural and well-crafted effort should improve for a decade or more."
US,85,20,Red Blend,red,Sweet Valley Wines 2007 Double Barrel Red Blend Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This has a pruney character in keeping with the high 15.4% alcohol. It's dark and liquorous, beyond ripe, and finishes hot, with chalky, earthy tannins."
US,84,42,Merlot,red,Stemilt Creek 2014 Ascent One-Half Mile Closer to the Moon Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas are a bit unsettled, bringing a wilted-flower note that is off-putting. The ripe cherry, blackberry and smoky flavors seem disconnected. It doesn't all come together, and the variety seems impossible to find."
France,94,144,Chardonnay,white,Olivier Leflaive 2012 Genevrières Premier Cru  (Meursault),"The wood is still very present in this young wine, giving acidity and creamy, toasty character. The wine, as it develops, will become ripe, full of yellow fruits and honey while always keeping that great acidity. Since it needs to age, drink from 2018."
US,86,32,Sangiovese,red,Rusack 2009 Sangiovese (Santa Ynez Valley),"Very ripe and flashy, but a little too sweet. Shows sugary raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with lots of zippy acidity."
US,86,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Sutcliffe 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Colorado),"A scent of pastry dough encases the broad notes of spiced dark fruit and flower on this Cabernet Sauvignon. This is a medium- to full-bodied wine, and it bears firm tannins and bright acids that carry onto the medium to long finish."
US,91,80,Syrah,red,La Sirena 2004 Barrett Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),"From Heidi Barrett's estate vineyard in Calistoga, this Syrah is very rich and appealing. What it lacks in complex subtlety it makes up for in immediate chocolate-inspired blackberry jam and mushu plum flavors. Firmly tannic, it might age for a while, but will show best now through 2012."
US,91,30,Chardonnay,white,Groth 2014 Hillview Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"This is a thick, rich and layered white from Oak Knoll District-grown estate fruit. It's inviting, with lemon chiffon, baked pineapple and anise. Medium bodied and not afraid to be robust, wet-stone minerality brings it together."
US,89,28,Pinot Noir,red,Vista Hills 2012 Treehouse Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"From a warm, ripe vintage, this reflects those characteristics with fruit-driven flavors of plum, berry and apricot. Round and full-bodied, it finishes with a lick of orange liqueur."
US,88,12,Red Blend,red,Gnarly Head 2014 Authentic Black Red (Lodi),"A deep color and ripe, gushing fruit aromas lead to generous dark cherry and blackberry flavors in this wine. Firm tannins are loosened by a sugary element that lingers on the finish."
US,94,56,Pinot Noir,red,Papapietro Perry 2012 Nunes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a lighter style of the variety from a stellar vineyard, a crisp take on red cherry, dried cranberry and pomegranate that's deliciously balanced and sublime. A subtle suggestion of oak and spice peeks out on the lengthy finish, making for a complete, extremely quaffable wine."
Italy,86,10,Red Blend,red,Masi 2006 Modello delle Venezie Red (Veneto),"Here's an easy, well-valued red blend of Refosco, Raboso and other indigenous grapes from the Verona area with an approachable, no-fuss disposition and aromas of blueberry, forest floor and lingering sweet spice. It has plush berry flavors and a gritty, raw texture."
US,88,36,Syrah,red,Margerum 2009 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"A balanced, complex Syrah, a little lower in alcohol than many others, and as a result smoother and more elegant. At the same time, it has potent blackberry, currant, bacon and pepper flavors. Drink now–2015."
US,86,100,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Oak Mountain 2011 The Cave Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Temecula Valley),"Elderberry and blueberry fruit meet with an interesting eucalyptus oil and spearmint component on the nose of this bottling. The minty charatcer shows strongly on the palate, with camphor tones decorating the black-plum fruit."
US,87,32,Zinfandel,red,Del Carlo Winery 2010 Old Vine Home Ranch Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This is an old-style, rustic Zin. It's tannic and high in alcohol, with wild berry jam, currant, spice and heady liqueur flavors. A little pricy, but a sound, robust wine with plenty of forthright character."
US,87,24,Chardonnay,white,Sonoma-Cutrer 2006 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Here's a rich Chardonnay. It's upfront in pineapple pie, peach cobbler, pear jam, apple butter and caramelly oak flavors, yet is dry and pleasantly crisp in acidity. Drink now."
US,91,32,Pinot Grigio,white,Luna 2015 Reserve Estate Pinot Grigio (Napa Valley),"Lush texture meets crisp acidity in this full-figured exploration of ripe peach and pear. Nutty and quietly floral, it ends in a voluptuous finish of smoky spice."
US,90,115,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Lancaster 2014 Nicole's Estate Bottled Red (Alexander Valley),"Made predominantly from the winery's best barrels of Cabernet Sauvignon, this blend also contains Malbec, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Game, cinnamon, burly, brambly blackberry and tar are robustly wound around a big-boned structure, with hints of vanilla and smoke."
France,82,14,White Blend,white,Baron Philippe de Rothschild 1998  Graves,"This one comes from the Mouton branch of the Rothschilds. Showing its age a bit already, with mature apple and wood varnish aromas that perk up a bit on the palate, where they pick up some attractive lemon nuances."
Italy,90,30,Red Blend,red,Vignavecchia 2010 Vigneto Odoardo Beccari Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"A blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo, this opens with aromas of violet, mature plum, espresso and a whiff of forest floor. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, ground pepper, toast and clove while packed, fine-grained tannins provide support. Drink through 2020."
US,92,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Easton 2010 Monarch Mine Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Sierra Foothills),"This crisp white is inviting and dry, with aromas of citrus, fig and fennel. Reminiscent of a fine Sancerre, it's finely structured, steely and still lushly textured and full enough in the mouth to enjoy with seafood, a creamy goat cheese salad or entirely on its own."
Italy,94,50,Sangiovese,red,Baricci 2011  Brunello di Montalcino,"Aromas suggesting underbrush, scorched earth, mature black-skinned fruit and a whiff of dried mint jump out of the glass. The big, chewy palate doles out mature Marasca cherry, graphite, chopped herb and dark cooking spice alongside firm, refined tannins. It's delicious. Drink 2019–2026."
US,87,18,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Pull 2012 BDX Red (Paso Robles),"Tar, dried meat, olallieberry and sharp cedar aromas show on this blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon and 49% Merlot. Dried strawberries and plums mix with thyme and dried rose petals on the palate."
Italy,84,7,Pinot Grigio,white,Kirkland Signature 2010 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Grave),"You can't beat this price for a Pinot Grigio with natural freshness and pristine aromas of stone fruit and citrus. The nice thing is that it tastes Italian made, and not like many of the commercial, generic Grigios on the market today."
US,92,85,Pinot Noir,red,Archery Summit 2008 Looney Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"The Looney Vineyard bottling is the outlier in the Archery Summit lineup—a different AVA and a non-estate vineyard. The Ribbon Ridge AVA is a subset of a subset within the Willamette Valley, and it may be the hidden gem for producing great Pinot Noir. This wine is sensual, spirited, spicy and smooth. The cherry and raspberry fruit is highlighted with bright acidity and whiffs of baking spices. The new oak is gently applied and the use of wild yeasts may have added some textural nuances also."
US,85,10,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Magnificent Wine Company 2010 Steak House Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The notes of ash, cherry, and plum are faint and soft in feel but it's well priced for the quality and delivers enough tannic heft to live up to its name."
France,95,158,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Leflaive 2010 Clavoillon Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),"A taut, nervy, mineral-driven wine, this has intense citrus and grapefruit flavors, lemon grass spice and just the merest hint of wood. It's the structure that gives this impressive wine such power, and a steely edge that will need at least 6–10 years."
France,90,10,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Camelot la Chapelle 2011  Bordeaux,"This is a wine with potential. It has weight and ripe berry fruits balanced with solid tannins and a dense texture. Behind the structure, the fruit and acidity promise good things. Drink from 2016."
Italy,87,13,White Blend,white,Bolla 2012 Tufaie  (Soave Classico Superiore),It starts with a light fragrance of spring flowers and pear. The bright palate offers white peach and citrus notes alongside crisp acidity that leaves a clean finish.
France,92,42,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château la Garde 2014  Pessac-Léognan,"This wine, which is dominated by Sauvignon Blanc, is from a small plot in the vineyard of La Garde. It is wood aged, giving spice as well as ripe, smooth fruit. There is a young herbal edge that will certainly soften as it ages. This is an aromatic crisp wine that will be ready to drink from 2021."
France,87,14,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,G. Moulinier 2009 Tradition Red (Saint-Chinian),"Wild barnyard notes dance among the rich dark fruit and berry core. Garrigue and bramble accents add more character to the smooth and silky mouth, while the medium finish lands on a softly oak-kissed flavor. Drink now."
US,95,52,Pinot Noir,red,Williams Selyem 2012 Eastside Road Neighbors Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Since this is the winery's largest production Pinot, but still under 1,000 cases, buyers actually have a chance of finding this full-bodied beauty. Sly on the nose, it is tense in toasty oak and chewy cherry, venturing into black cherry, blackberry and root beer. It's amply structured and robust, yet with silky tannins. Enjoy through 2022."
US,88,50,Pinot Noir,red,Colene Clemens 2014 Dopp Creek Estate Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"A streak of coffee runs dramatically down a tight, snappy core of citrus and berry fruit. Flavors are lightly dusted with pepper, remaining bright and precise through the finish."
Italy,94,50,Sangiovese,red,Pian delle Querci 2006 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Aromas of leather, forest floor, tobacco, mature berry and a balsamic note open this structured, elegant wine. The palate delivers crushed black cherry, cinnamon, licorice and savory herb alongside firm but polished tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2016–2026."
US,85,16,Merlot,red,Liberty School 2013 Merlot (Central Coast),"Turned earth, coffee grounds, asphalt and dried cherries show on the mushroomy nose of this widely available bottling. Black tea and strong coffee flavors emerge through a thick veil of chunky tannins."
US,85,38,Chardonnay,white,AuburnJames 2014 Berry Lane Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley),This medium-bodied wine opens with a squeeze of acidity and follows through with simple and straightforward citrus flavors.
US,91,50,Pinot Noir,red,Amalie Robert 2011 Amalie's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Taking the best from each individual clonal selection, this blend shows both muscle and finesse. The chunky core of cherry fruit is fringed with orange peel, lifted with crisp acidity, and finished with a light touch of cinnamon. It's drinking well, and can best be enjoyed through 2020."
France,91,75,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Domaine de Beaurenard 2012 Boisrenard Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"This Demeter-certified biodynamic wine is made in an immediately enjoyable, drink-now style. Brandied black cherries and sun-baked earth mark the nose, while the palate is full, creamy and plush. It's warm, ripe and welcoming from start to finish."
Italy,87,110,Red Blend,red,Grattamacco 2001  Bolgheri Superiore,Despite the obvious quality of this wine—obvious in its vibrant ruby color and full bouquet of berry and spice aromas—there's a tiny touch of something pungent that recalls kerosene or alcohol. The structure is firm and solid without being bulky and it delivers flavors of small berry fruit.
US,89,38,Chardonnay,white,V. Sattui 2013 Carsi Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"A density of honey and caramel washes over this vineyard-designate, a concentrated and viscous expression of the variety. Layered in light waves of lemon, it finishes with a bite of ripe yellow apple and more of that caramel."
France,88,26,Pinot Noir,red,Fournier Père et Fils 2009 Les Belles Vignes Rosé Pinot Noir (Sancerre),"The crispness and acidity are very evident in this bright, fresh, strawberry-flavored wine. Drink soon for its delicious liveliness."
France,88,14,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Château Ollieux Romanis 2008 Cuvée Alice Red (Corbières),"Juicy red plum and bright berries fill the palate, while accents of savory herbs and wild animal add depth to the nose. Balanced and approachable with a satiny structure and a medium-length finish. Drink now."
US,89,25,Riesling,white,Casa Larga 2014 Wild Ferment Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Subtle smoke notes accent tangerine, lemon and lime in this invigorating dry Riesling. Fermented via ambient yeast, its refinement and restrained elegance sets it apart from Casa Larga's other Rieslings. The finish is lingering yet fresh."
US,93,50,Chardonnay,white,Williams Selyem 2011 Allen Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"The wine shows the fine acidity of the vintage, but also intense flavors of green apples, Asian pears and oranges. Oak brings luscious, balanced notes of vanilla and toast. A gorgeous, sumptuous wine that should drink well for the next six years."
US,91,89,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Goldschmidt 2013 Game Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"This 100% varietal wine is spicy and succulent, with a touch of oak reduction on the nose that resolves as it opens. Big boned, it tastes dark cherry- and plum-driven, spiked with cinnamon and black pepper."
France,84,25,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Barton & Guestier 2009 Thomas Barton Réserve  (Sauternes),"The wine is still very young, revealing sweetness rather than the botrytis complexity of previous vintages. Honey, peach and pineapple flavors offer fruitiness."
France,87,12,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Domaine du Claouset 2015  Bordeaux Blanc,"This ripe wine from the Siozard family has a smooth texture. It has some spice, rich apple and apricot fruits and touches of more tropical fruits. While the wine is full in the mouth, it still guards some attractive freshness. Drink now."
France,85,16,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Haut-Canteloup 2012  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"Situated two miles north of the castle of Blaye, this estate has produced an obviously wood-aged, heavily extracted wine. At this stage, this wine is all tannins, smoky acidity and structure. It will always be concentrated with wood, although this will soften."
US,86,30,Sangiovese,red,3 Horse Ranch Vineyards 2014 Single Vineyard Sangiovese,"This wine offers aromas of wild berry, flowers, barrel notes and spice. The palate is lighter styled, backed by chalky tannins. The variety seems somewhat hard to find."
US,86,23,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hunter Ashby 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Black currant and cherry flavors, accented with a touch of smoky oak, mark this dry, smooth wine. It has the textural hallmarks of the best of Napa Valley Cabernet, but lacks the richness. Drink now."
US,92,31,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Eric Kent 2014 Cuvée Renee Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"The grapes for this lovely wine come from the Dry Stack Vineyard and Fallenleaf, some of which is planted to the Sauvignon Musque clone. Zesty acidity takes the first punch, remaining brightly balanced and explosive on the palate, with additional hits of white peach, apricot and honey."
US,86,30,Pinot Noir,red,Lucas & Lewellen 2011 Goodchild High 9 Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"This Pinot is dry, silky and light-bodied. It shows pleasant raspberry, cola and red currant flavors that finish clean and racy, and the alcohol level is a refreshingly low 13.5% by volume. It requires no aging, so drink up."
US,92,52,Pinot Noir,red,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2008 Trenton Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The vineyard is in a very cool, damp part of the valley, and this particular bottling always shows a dry finish, considerable tannins and an earthiness not found in warmer parts of the appellation. This 2008 follows those lines. It has a dense core of sour cherry candy fruit, with some superripe currants. Will age interestingly over the decade."
US,93,49,Pinot Noir,red,MacPhail 2009 Toulouse Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"MacPhail has shown steady improvement working with this vineyard, which seems to require a cool year like 2009 to succeed. The wine is quite light in body and color, but the flavors really penetrate and sink in deep. They range from red cherries and cola to red licorice, bacon and spices, with a deft touch of oak. Dry and crisp in acidity, it should provide fascinating drinking over the next seven years."
US,88,54,Pinot Noir,red,Loring Wine Company 2015 Clos Pepe Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Plum and grape aromas kick off this bottling from Brian Loring, accented by clove, Indian spice and crushed cinnamon. Stewed black plum, peppercorn, turned earth and broad fruit flavors combine in a somewhat muddy formation on the palate."
US,86,17,Merlot,red,William Hill Estate 2014 Merlot (Central Coast),"Dried plum, dried strawberry and dried raspberry meet with cola spice on the fresh if thin nose of this bottling. The palate offers sour plums, peppercorns, damp compost and smoke flavors."
US,92,38,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Bonny Doon 2009 Le Cigare Volant Red (Central Coast),"There's a bit more fruit—cherry, cranberry—and no dust to this Cigare compared to other Bonny Doon bottlings, but blacker aromas of asphalt and char persist. The blend of 36% Syrah, 25% Grenache, 20% Mourvèdre and 19% Cinsault delivers strong tannins and flavors of a black-and-blue filet mignon topped with a wild berry reduction sauce"
US,88,35,Pinot Noir,red,Boedecker Cellars 2011 Athena Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Nicely differentiated from the companion Stewart bottling, this Athena is a sharp and spicy affair, with tight, tart cranberry and raspberry fruit. Native yeast fermentation and extended sur-lie aging add some snap to the finish. Try after 2016 for optimum enjoyment."
US,88,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Ravenswood 2011 Pickberry Vineyards Red (Sonoma Mountain),"This Merlot-heavy blend adds an additional 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Malbec to its mix, all from a single vineyard high atop Sonoma Mountain. Dill, cucumber and cranberry combine intriguingly, before a core of juicy acidity adds buoyancy to the mix."
US,90,28,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Robert Mondavi 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The winery shows its prowess with making delicious, affordable larger-production wines with this bright and easy drinking Cabernet, a study in soft tannins, juicy cranberry/currant fruit and composed structure. It's a good one to stock up on at the price and quality."
Italy,88,13,Syrah,red,Giannoni Fabbri 2010 Amato Syrah (Cortona),"Aromas of mature black fruit, blue flower, kitchen spice and a whiff of aromatic herb lead the nose on this savory wine. The smooth, easygoing palate doles out black cherry, plum, white pepper and a hint of anise alongside fresh acidity and polished tannins. Enjoy now."
US,87,40,Chardonnay,white,Saintsbury 2009 Brown Ranch Chardonnay (Carneros),"This shows the dried herb character that often characterizes Napa Chardonnay, giving the pineapple and orange flavors an earthiness. It's very dry and crisp in acidity, but it ultimately trades opulence for elegance. Drink now."
US,89,22,Red Blend,red,Canoe Ridge 2014 The Explorer Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"This blend of 49% Syrah, 27% Cabernet Franc and 24% Cabernet Sauvignon leads with boysenberry, blackberry and sweet spice aromas, followed by full-bodied, lush fruit flavors. The tannins are a bit tacky, but it's otherwise appealing, showing pleasant balance."
US,91,25,Riesling,white,Carmina Burana 2008 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"From Long Shadows, a rare, barrel-fermented Riesling. Sappy, tart, juicy and stylish, this is loaded with pear, grapefruit and Meyer lemon. The acidity is generous but softened up a bit by the extra oxygen from the fuder."
US,93,80,Pinot Noir,red,Blue Farm 2014 King Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"This herb-laced wine comes from a 1,100-feet elevation outpost five miles from the ocean and shows both feral notes and robust fruit. Tart cranberry flavor dominates, complemented by orange peel nuances. Its tannins are in full force, calling for more time in the glass if not in the cellar. Best the second day after opening, if one can wait."
US,92,40,Pinot Noir,red,Evening Land 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Smoky, spicy and midweight, this earthy, brooding Pinot maintains layers of minerality amid fresh red berry fruit. The texture opens up into silky waves in the glass, finishing with the right balance of cherry and spice."
US,90,45,Pinot Noir,red,Phillips Hill 2012 Valenti Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge),"This has a red-brick rim, and mellow aromas and soft texture seem to confirm this is a mature wine that's ready to enjoy. Aromas resemble cranberry and raspberry, while the flavors are more like sweet red cherries and pomegranate seeds. The texture is soft and smooth."
US,86,100,Red Blend,red,Wente 2011 The Art of Giving Red (Livermore Valley),"Made to benefit the Wente Foundation for Arts Education, this wine is made in small quantities. It is juicy and leathery, soft, structured and medium-bodied with a long finish of tar and tannin."
France,90,55,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Saint-Pierre 2007  Saint-Julien,"Impressively ripe fruit, with smoky flavors from wood, the texture sweet and fleshy. The wine has juicy berry flavors, with the freshest acidity, livened with spice from the fruit and the oak aging. Worth aging for 5–10 years."
US,91,42,Red Blend,red,Guyomar 2011 Laity Red (Paso Robles),"This blend of 42% Syrah, 31% Petite Sirah, 20% Zinfandel and 7% Grenache from the Templeton Gap area shows aromas of grape soda, pencil lead, sweet violets and effervescent cola, all fun yet elegantly restrained. Blueberry, black pepper and fresh purple fruit combine for a very lively wine, with strong acidity on the palate."
US,92,80,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Valance 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Three things characterize this wine: exceptionally intense blackberry and currant flavors, thick, hard tannins and a bone dry finish. It's big and firm with a lot of promise, so do try to cellar it for at least six years, but people who like their wines young could try it sooner."
US,91,45,Pinot Noir,red,Sokol Blosser 2010 Dundee Hills Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This cuvée offers a classic mix of rose petals, black cherry and cola. It's lively, fruity and light on its feet. Delicate touches of herb, pinpoint acidity, a hint of lime and perfect balance keep it satisfying through an extended finish."
US,87,10,Chardonnay,white,Fetzer 2013 Sundial Chardonnay (California),"As tasty as a pear tart, this combines mild pear, vanilla and almond flavors on a smooth texture. Medium bodied, balanced slightly to the soft side, and quite fruity, it will make a satisfying glass at cocktail time or with dinner."
US,85,16,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Emmolo 2000 Rutherford Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"More oak than the wine can handle is what you get here, from the woody, buttery overtoasted nose through the soft, clumsy, creamy body.  It's a real challenge to find any fruit, so you had better like a fully wooded wine if you're going to take a crack at this one."
France,90,17,Red Blend,red,Domaine d'Escausses 2012 La Vigne Blanche Red (Gaillac),"The “blanc” in the name refers to the white grapes historically planted in this vineyard. Now the vines are a varied red blend of Syrah, Fer Servadou, Merlot and Duras. Seventh-generation winemaker Jean-Marc Balaran creates a fruity, structured wine that is well-balance. Touches of spice from the wood aging complement the smoothness of the wine with its light, fresh aftertaste. Drink now."
US,87,18,Pinot Noir,red,Elizabeth Rose 2008 Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"This is a lush, soft and frankly delicious Pinot Noir that delivers far more quality than most Pinots under $20. It's dry and silky, with flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola, vanilla and spices, and a sweet vanilla veneer of oak."
US,88,14,Red Blend,red,Novy 2011 Four Mile Creek Red (North Coast),"Closed aromatically at first, this medium-bodied wine develops dark plum and cocoa notes amidst a juicy mid palate. Dusty tannins end things nicely. There's not a lot of red wine out there of this quality at this price."
US,94,120,Syrah,red,Horsepower 2014 Sur Echalas Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"Alluring and intense aromas of soot, campfire, charcuterie, black pepper, herb, crushed flowers and liquid stone lead to a broadly rich, intense, flavorful palate, absolutely loaded with fruit and savory flavors that glide on the extended finish."
US,95,70,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Mount Eden Vineyards 2012 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Extremely elegant and restrained at first on the nose, this bottling eventually shows gravel and crushed rocks, with hints of blackberry and forest underbrush also emerging. A very firm structure weaves together an incredibly well-integrated wine, with dense mulberry and dried-fennel notes that morph into crushed herbs with time. Drink 2018–2032."
Italy,90,32,White Blend,white,Castello della Sala 2014 Conte della Vipera White (Umbria),"Made with 60% Sauvignon Blanc and 40% Sémillon, this vibrant wine offers aromas of pressed white flower and white stone fruit. The lively, elegant palate delivers white peach, grapefruit, nectarine and chopped herb alongside racy acidity. A mineral note closes the clean, crisp finish."
France,88,28,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Pindefleurs 2014  Saint-Émilion,"Strongly dominated by its wood aging, this is a toasty, licorice and dark-coffee-flavored wine. It does have some black-fruit weight that should allow the wine to balance out. So wait until at least 2019 before drinking."
US,84,24,Merlot,red,Sheldrake Point 2006 Barrel Reserve Merlot (Finger Lakes),"This wine hits all the right notes—gamy spice, a touch of minerality, savory, rich fruit. A touch of oak adds muscle and the overall package is satisfying."
US,80,28,Pinot Noir,red,Del Rio 2007 Pinot Noir (Rogue Valley),"Light, almost ephemeral, this pale Pinot does not give you much to hold on to. The fruit is thin to the point of invisible, tasting of watermelon and little else. Thin, watery and plain."
US,93,19,Pinot Noir,red,Charles Heintz 2013 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Sought-after vineyard grower Charles Heintz has teamed with stellar Sonoma County winemaker Hugh Chappelle (Lynmar, Quivira) to make this divine estate-grown Rosé, pale pink in the glass with hugely inviting floral aromatics. From there is a bolt of electricity, the wine juicy and alive in peach, citrus and strawberry, mouthwatering and light."
US,90,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Seven Hills 2014 McClellan Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Green herb, barrel spice, clove and cherry aromas intermingle and lead to a highly structured palate, with supple fruit flavors. It might be a touch green for some tastes."
US,89,17,Zinfandel,red,Pedroncelli 2012 Mother Clone Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Blended with 8% Petite Sirah and then aged almost a year in American oak, 30% of it new, this is fruity and smoky in equal measure. Its tones of blackberry, leather and black pepper are harmonious. Round and soft, it's easy to drink and will be approachable to a variety of palates."
US,90,48,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,V. Sattui 2010 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"With 4% Petit Verdot added for body and color, this Cab is otherwise on the brighter side of red fruit and acidity, nicely balanced and approachable in cranberry, cassis and a wink of violet. It's not as meaty and robust as the winery's Morisoli, a tamer version of a similar beast."
US,91,36,Pinot Noir,red,Stephen Ross 2015 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Piquant aromas of cinnamon meet with strawberry, plum, gravel and bay leaf on the nose of this appellation blend by Steve Dooley. That bay leaf joins eucalyptus on the very clean and fresh sip, which surrounds tart raspberry, vanilla and clove flavors."
US,92,40,Red Blend,red,Graziano 2013 Coro Mendocino Red (Mendocino),"Richness is the hallmark of this full-bodied, luxuriously ripe and fruit-drenched Zinfandel blend. Blueberry, black cherry and blackberry jam aromas and flavors coat the palate, crowding out any oak-derrived accents that might be present. It comes off as pure and fruity deliciousness."
Italy,91,68,Red Blend,red,Elena Walch 2011 Kermesse Cuvée Red (Alto Adige),"Made with equal parts Lagrein, Merlot, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, this structured, balanced red boasts aromas of black pepper, black currant, toast and a whiff of bell pepper. The firm palate delivers mature plum, roasted coffee bean and allspice accompanied by chewy tannins. Drink through 2021."
US,85,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Trentadue 2009 La Storia Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"A soft Cabernet, this brims with granola-bar-like flavors of blackberry, roasted almond and brown sugar."
France,91,40,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Domaine de Nalys 2013 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"This is a strong showing for Nalys, surprisingly full-bodied and creamy-textured for the estate. Hints of wood char and roasted meat mark the nose, while the flavors of mocha and brown sugar carry through the plush, velvety finish. Drink now–2023."
France,85,19,Pinot Gris,white,Cave de Kientzheim-Kaysersberg 2013 Anne de K Pinot Gris (Alsace),"This soft, fruity, light wine has great white fruits and a cut of attractive acidity. It's crisp, spiced with nutmeg and given freshness by the sliced green apple."
US,91,32,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Amavi 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Aromas of cocoa, herb, woodspice and blue and black fruit lead to lush, palate-coating dark fruit flavors that display depth and richness, backed by a dry lick of tannins."
France,87,42,Pinot Noir,red,Moillard 2010 Clos du Meix Trouhans  (Fixin),"A firmly structured wine, this has a dry character that's underscored by red fruit and balancing acidity. It needs to age for a few years to be at its best."
US,90,28,Pinot Noir,red,Child's Play 2016 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A nice debut from this new label under the Tendril umbrella. Intense in color and deep in flavor, this pure varietal rosé pushes forward raspberry and cherry fruit with plenty of juicy pizzazz. The back end revs up with a burst of citrus rind."
US,95,40,Pinot Noir,red,La Follette 2010 Van der Kamp Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),"A tremendous wine, this appeals to the senses as well as the intellect. Dry, tart in acidity and somewhat tannic, it shows complex flavors of raspberry and cherry pie, bacon, cinnamon, white pepper and sandalwood. The finish goes on and on. So delicious now, you can hardly keep from drinking it, but this is a Pinot Noir that will age for 6–8 years, gradually losing primary fruit and gaining interesting mushroom and dried fruit notes."
US,85,18,Red Blend,red,Yorkville Cellars 2007 Hi-Rollr Red (Mendocino County),"A good, rather rugged wine. It's edgy in tannins and somewhat overripe, with raisin, plum, blackberry, coffee and spice flavors. But it's nicely dry. Zinfandel, Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot."
US,84,42,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Wattle Creek 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Lots of flashy blackberry and cassis flavors in this Cabernet. Easy to drink, but feels way too soft to earn a higher score. Drink up."
France,85,11,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Les Vignobles Foncalieu 2007 Bastide de Beauvert Red (Côtes du Rhône),"A typical medium-bodied Côtes du Rhône, the 2007 Bastide de Beauvert features aromas of cherry, clove and sweaty leather, and flavors that run along similar lines. Mature; drink now."
US,90,50,Pinot Noir,red,Arbor Brook 2013 Estate 777 Block Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Produced from a single clone—Dijon 777—this offers pretty, fragrant raspberry scents and flavors. It's just rounded out enough for ready drinking. A fairly light wine, it fades gently with a saline minerality."
US,87,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Buttonwood Farm 2007 Zingy Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"Zingy is a great word for this dry, crisp Sauvignon Blanc. The lemon, lime, grapefruit and spice flavors cleanse the palate. Nice with shellfish, goat cheese, grilled veggies."
US,82,9,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Surf Point 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"A dry, thin, modest Cabernet, the kind you drink in a paper cup at big parties. The host serves it, and you drink with the food."
Italy,88,25,White Blend,white,I Capitani 2006 Faius White (Irpinia),"Here's a smoky, nutty blend of Greco and Fiano with a flat, broad approach and well-integrated notes of pear, Golden Delicious apple and honey. The wine tastes soft and thick and makes a excellent impression on the palate."
US,93,32,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cameron Hughes 2013 Lot 597 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"An impressive effort at an attractive price, this is a full-bodied wine with an elegant edge. Floral in aroma, it luxuriates in high-toned flavors of cassis and cranberry. Soft and smooth in texture, it's graceful despite its power, and lengthy too."
Italy,88,23,White Blend,white,Marco Felluga 2010 Molamatta White (Collio),"Molamatta is a blend of Pinot Bianco, Friulano and Ribolla Gialla that opens with a pretty golden color and rich aromas of creamy peach and vanilla mousse with pretty highlights of citrus and light spice. This feels rich and long on the palate."
Italy,88,18,Pinot Grigio,white,Volpe Pasini 2002 Zuc de Volpe Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"A well-judged, well-structured wine that balances fresh, crisp and light fruit against flavors of peaches, almonds and cinnamon. It will be better in two or three years' time."
US,88,30,Syrah,red,3 Horse Ranch Vineyards 2014 Single Vineyard Syrah,"One of the first bottles to bear the name of this new growing region, the aromas are light with notes of baking spice, cherry, vanilla and Red Vines. The fruit flavors are sweet and supple, backed by lightly grainy tannins."
US,93,80,Pinot Noir,red,The Eyrie Vineyards 2013 Daphne Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This selection from a 40-year-old vineyard manages to convey both power and complexity in a transparent, nearly ephemeral style. Like gazing into a clear pool of deep water, you plunge through a surface patina of ripe, crushed raspberries into a textural, evanescent palate framed in dark chocolate. Drink now through 2030 and beyond."
US,95,52,Pinot Noir,red,Failla 2012 Whistler Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is one of Failla's riper, fruitier 2012 Pinots. Classic Sonoma Coast Pinot, with brisk acidity and complex flavors, it shows wild raspberry, cherry and blueberry fruits, persimmons, cola, and earthier notes of sautéed wild mushrooms and truffles. It's dry, tannic and tart, but as good as it is now, it will improve by resting until 2020."
US,84,17,Pinot Noir,red,J. Lohr 2011 Falcon's Perch Pinot Noir (Monterey County),"Not much going on with this simple but drinkable Pinot Noir. It's light in body and softly crisp, with slightly sweet cherry pie and sweet oak flavors."
US,94,55,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Nicora 2014 Law Vineyard Red (Adelaida District),"Rich black plum pudding, cigar box and pine needle aromas show on the nose of this blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache from this increasingly prominent vineyard. The sip is hearty with tons of juniper, licorice and forest floor spice that enhance the incredibly lavish base of blackberry and black currant fruit. The structure is rigid in form yet polished and soft, with acidity laced throughout."
US,88,16,Chardonnay,white,River Road 2012 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"There's just a touch of oak on this Chardonnay, enough to give it hints of smoke and buttered toast. The palate is dominated by flavors of tropical fruits, citrus, peaches and green apples, balanced with crisp lime-juice acidity. It's an elegant, dry Chard at a good price."
US,87,25,Red Blend,red,Di Arie 2009 Interlude Red (Sierra Foothills),"Dark, smoky and oaky, this ripe wine tastes very much of the 40% Primitivo featured in the blend. It has nice structure, with Syrah, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah also in the mix. It's ready to drink, especially with pasta with an herb sauce."
US,83,28,Sangiovese,red,Benessere 2008 Sangiovese (Napa Valley),"Not a successful vintage for the winery's Sangiovese. The wine is a bit unripe, with flavors of green vegetable, cherry and white pepper."
US,90,23,Riesling,white,V. Sattui 2014 Dry Riesling (California),"This aromatic wine does a great job of combining effusive fruit with a lively balance. Beautiful orange blossom and honeysuckle aromas blend into delicious apple flavors while a tangy, lemon-zest sensation lights up the texture."
US,89,19,Chardonnay,white,River Road 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"The 2012 reserve costs only $3 more than the regular bottling, but it's a richer wine balanced with bright, citrusy acidity. The palate is dry with flavors of Bosc pears, green apples, vanilla cream and toasted marshmallows."
US,90,32,Pinot Noir,red,Iris Vineyards 2014 Aroha Vineyard Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"Just a couple of barrels were produced of this vineyard-designate. Tasting of lush strawberry preserves, it's nicely focused, slightly peppery, and offers skin flavors as well as fleshy fruit. Sweet barrel spices carry a hint of clove, and round off a big, delicious finish."
France,83,16,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Haut Prieur 2012  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"Vanilla and caramel flavors dominate this wine after 12 months in French oak. That means that the fruit is really not allowed to shine. It is firm, very dry and all about spice. A pepper flavor from the alcohol leaves a burn in the mouth."
US,91,55,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Anderson 2013 Dach Vineyard Chardonnay (Anderson Valley),"This reserved and classically styled wine has subtle fig and marzipan aromas, is dry on the palate, with a bundle of tight fruit and spice flavors wound up in fresh acidity that emerge slowly with each sip and on the finish. It is a serious wine and a good candidate to age until 2018 or longer."
France,89,30,Chardonnay,white,Dominique Cornin 2008  Pouilly-Fuissé,"A soft, rounded wine, feeling generous, even opulent. The acidity is there, fitting into the folds of the rich texture."
US,87,23,Merlot,red,Raymond 2007 Reserve Selection Merlot (Napa Valley),"Spicy and briary, almost like Zinfandel, which gives this Merlot a somewhat rustic feel. But it's rich in raspberries, cherries, currants and toast. Drink it now."
US,89,24,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Alexandria Nicole 2011 A Squared Destiny Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"There's much to like in this wine's notes of cocoa and cherry, with the barrel spices bringing a sense of confection. The flavors are appealing but the tannins bring a slight feel of gruffness that holds it back."
US,84,38,Syrah,red,MacLaren 2009 Judge Family Vineyard Syrah (Bennett Valley),"Bennett Valley is a cooler section of Sonoma County, and maybe the cool vintage was just too much. This wine isn't quite ripe.It's bone dry, acidic and tannic, and the fruit is herbal."
Italy,86,24,Red Blend,red,Rocca di Frassinello 2004 Poggio alla Guardia  (Maremma),"This Merlot, Cab Sauvignon and Sangioveto blend is a bit thorny and sharp because high notes of black peppercorn, cola and pine forest seem to rise above the wine's natural fruit."
US,87,22,Merlot,red,Hudson-Chatham 2011 Merlot (New York),"Luscious black cherry and cassis notes are kissed with menthol on this elegantly structured Merlot. It's a wine with wide appeal, balancing juicy, forward fruit with a streak of cranberry acidity and penetrating, yet velvet-textured, tannins."
Italy,84,14,Pinot Grigio,white,Villa Cornaro 2011 Limited Selection Pinot Grigio (Veneto),"This is one of those fun, easygoing Italian Pinot Grigios that tastes great on a hot summer afternoon. The wine is crisp, light and lean with simple endnotes of citrus and melon."
US,84,28,Merlot,red,Sunstone 2005 Merlot (Santa Barbara County),"A soft, dry and easy wine to like, this Merlot has flavors of cherries, blackberries, Asian spices and cola, with smoky overtones of oak. Drink now."
US,83,28,Chardonnay,white,Keswick Vineyards 2011 Chardonnay (Monticello),"Shy, timid notes of white peach and tropical fruit are offset by hints of vanilla and nutty biscuit. It feels medium to full bodied, but this lacks intensity and concentration overall. A touch of spice on the midpalate adds interest."
US,84,25,Chardonnay,white,VML 2010 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Sweet oak dominates, making it taste like buttered toast dipped into wine. The pineapple and orange fruit underneath all that wood is just fine."
US,93,125,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Janzen 2012 Cloudy's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Dark, rich mountain blueberry and blackberry form the core of this classically delicious Napa Valley wine from an estate vineyard. Velvety dark chocolate melts over integrated tannins and a medium-strength body, the finish lengthy, dusty and well-structured. Age through 2020–2022."
US,89,16,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Francis Ford Coppola 2015 Diamond Collection Yellow Label Sauvignon Blanc (California),"A fresh, grassy aroma and lively grapefruit and herb flavors give a lot of zest to this medium-bodied and almost peppery wine."
US,87,45,Chardonnay,white,Ca' Momi 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros-Napa Valley),"A healthy portion of barrel influence is felt in this reserve wine, amid medium acidity. This makes for a robust, full-bodied experience, highlighted by caramel apple pie and pineapple, with muddles of butterscotch."
France,90,55,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Cantinot 2010 Les Tours de Cantinot  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"Produced from a selection of grapes, this is a bold, fruity wine that has rich tannins and a generous structure. It is all about the black-fruit flavors with balanced acidity and just hints of toast. It is now a delicious, mature wine from a fine year. Drink now."
Italy,88,33,Red Blend,red,Gracciano della Seta 2012 Riserva  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"Toasted oak, espresso, new leather and steeped plum aromas waft out of the glass. The bracing palate offers grilled herb, licorice, toast and dried berry flavors, framed by grainy tannins that grip the finish."
US,91,79,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Caldera 2010 The Earth Speaks Red (Paso Robles),"This blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Franc is still quite fresh for being seven-years-old, offering aromas of concentrated red-cherry juice, allspice, sandalwood and nose-tickling cinnamon. Cedar and myrrh flavors lead the woody palate, where a buoyant acidity lifts up the red cherry and tart red-currant fruits."
US,85,22,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Robledo 2011 Seven Brothers Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),"This is a slightly sweet Sauvignon Blanc that's shy on the nose, without much depth or breadth."
US,88,30,Pinot Noir,red,Holman Ranch 2009 Pinot Noir (Carmel Valley),"Dry and bright in acidity, with a clean, silky mouthfeel. Shows fine raspberry and cherry fruit, with a squeeze of tangerine, leading to a spicy finish. Drink now with pork tenderloin, ahi tuna, roasted salmon."
US,91,21,Pinot Noir,red,Owen Roe 2014 Sharecropper's Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This deservedly popular value bottle gets the star Pinot treatment—nine months in French oak, 27% new. It's spicy and full-flavored, with resonant blue plum fruit, buttery toast and a tannic frame."
US,88,26,Pinot Noir,red,Robert Mondavi 2009 Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"This is a gentle, soft Pinot Noir, dry and silky, offering classic flavors of cherries, raspberries, spices and smoky oak, housed in a good structure of tannins. It's a lovely wine to drink now with steak or lamb."
US,88,40,Riesling,white,Grevino 2014 Estate Vineyards Riesling (Santa Maria Valley),"Yellow rose, honey-glazed almond, tangerine peel and beeswax aromas combine for a complex nose in this bottling from a new label. It's quite dry and tightly wound on the palate, where waxy flavors of sour orange, lemon spritz and grapefruit peel leave a bittersweet impression, finishing with a hint of petrol."
US,88,19,Pinot Noir,red,Fossil Point 2015 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Fleshy red plum and alpine strawberry fruit shows alongside vanilla and baking spice on the nose of this well-priced bottling from the Center of Effort team. The palate will please many, thanks to buoyant acidity and bright red cherry, raspberry and garrigue flavors."
US,86,24,Chardonnay,white,Jacob Williams 2012 Celilo Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this single-vineyard wine brings notes of yellow apple and lees accented by tart acidity. While it provides some interest, it doesn't seem like all of the pieces have quite come together."
US,87,19,Chardonnay,white,Wrath 2013 Ex Anima Chardonnay (Monterey),"The lack of new oak on this wine unleashes a torrent of ripe tropical fruit, including guava, as well as ripe pear. It's briny on the palate yet with quite perfumed and pungent flavors, more typical of a Rhône white than a California chardonnay."
Italy,87,40,Red Blend,red,Feudi della Medusa 2007 Crisaore Red (Isola dei Nuraghi),"Made from the little-known Cagnulari grape, this wine offers a cured meat accent, backed by blackberry and plum notes. It feels tight and raw on the palate, with integrated acidity on the finish."
France,89,35,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Thierry Drouin 2012 Métertière  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"This is a round, full-bodied wine, ripe with yellow fruits and structured with intense minerality. Great fruits and a touch of toast shine at the end. It's potentially a rich, densely textured wine that needs time. Drink from 2016."
France,85,14,Chardonnay,white,Cave de Lugny 2012 La Côte Blanche  (Mâcon-Villages),"Light, fruity and lemony, this wine has some weight, but it is more about crisp citrus with a touch of pear."
US,88,28,Chardonnay,white,Stoller 2008 SV Estate Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),"This is oily and ripe, with plenty of butter, butterscotch and toasty new oak. What elevates it, as with all Pacific Northwest Chardonnays, is the extra acidity, that provides a foundation of support under the lush fruit and generous new oak. It might smooth out a bit over the next couple of years, but it's a wine built to be savored sooner rather than later."
US,92,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,J. Lohr 2012 Cuvée Pom Red (Paso Robles),"This annual study of Pomerol by the longtime California producer is a bit reserved and nearly austere on the nose, slowly revealing black coffee bean, tar, elderberry and herbs. Crushed herbs and bittersweet chocolate show once sipped, giving slight spice to the dense elderberry and blueberry fruit. It's still a bit wound-up, so drink 2018–2028."
France,89,28,Pinot Gris,white,Jean-Baptiste Adam 2014 Les Natures Pinot Gris (Alsace),Rich hints of juicy pear on the nose lead to an equally fruity palate. The pear notes and juiciness are boosted by slight sweetness that is held in check by lovely texture and clean freshness. The finish is off dry.
US,92,70,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Upchurch 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"The aromas are almost completely closed up at present, occasionally revealing notes of barrel spice, dried cherries, herb and dark fruit. The palate displays a sense of elegance and nuance, showing pleasing subtleties. Give it some time in the cellar to for the wood to integrate and the fruit to blossom. Best after 2023."
US,87,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Louis M. Martini 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A good Cab, dry and smoothly tannic, with black currant, cedar and spice flavors. Totally dry, it shows sophistication and class, but not ageability. Easy to find, with more than 15,000 cases produced. Drink now."
US,90,34,Chardonnay,white,Trione 2015 River Road Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This is a bright, effusive, full-bodied wine, with underlying acidity that keeps it fresh in the glass. Apple and pear flavors combine with firm texture, providing weight and breadth."
US,81,12,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Layer Cake 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (California),Potent herb aromas and flavors mark this medium-bodied wine. It will need something assertive like pesto pasta to make a good match.
France,91,50,Pinot Noir,red,Labouré-Roi 2015 Les Marconnets Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),"Although this wine is tight with tannins and wood aging, it shows the softer side of the appellation with its ripe red berry fruit. Needing more time in bottle to deliver the opulence of its fine Premier Cru vineyard, it will be best from 2022."
US,81,12,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Esser 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey),"Nasty in ammonia and bell pepper aromas and flavors. Hardly any fruit at all, maybe a touch of acidic grapefruits and lemons. Yet it's dry and drinkable."
US,94,60,Syrah,red,Betz Family 2014 La Côte Rousse Syrah (Red Mountain),"This wine is a blend of fruit from Ranch at the End of the Road and Ciel du Cheval vineyards. Brooding aromas of dark raspberries, black plum, spice and mineral are followed by ripe generous full-bodied fruit flavors that display a lot of hedonism while retaining a spot-on sense of balance. It's sensational."
France,88,30,Pinot Noir,red,Alex Gambal 2011 Cuvée des Deux Papis  (Bourgogne),"Rich red fruits combine with good acidity, raspberry flavors and soft tannins. Ripe and juicy, it shows great fruitiness at the end."
US,91,56,Pinot Noir,red,Melville 2011 Terraces Estate Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Like all of Melville's new 2011 Pinot Noirs, this bottling is powerful and forward in cherries, raspberries and Dr. Pepper cola, alongside earthier mushroom and earth notes. It's a beautiful wine that shows the classy elegance of a well-grown Santa Rita Pinot, with brisk acids and firm but fine tannins. Drink now–2017 for maximum freshness."
France,90,35,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Pinson 2013 Cuvée Mademoiselle  (Chablis),"Made with skin contact and whole berry maceration to give extra flavor, this is a structured wine with a strong texture along with orange zest and light honey flavors. It is dense and concentrated. Drink from 2016."
US,87,11,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Columbia Crest 2006 Grand Estates Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a waxy, rather soft rendition of Sauvignon Blanc, and the pretty fruit flavors mix grapefruit, citrus and pineapple. There is very little suggestion of Sauvignon Blanc's herbal or grassy side; the grapes seem to have been ripened past that point, though not all the way to California-style, tropical fruit flavors. All in all this is a well-crafted, smooth and flavorful wine, with a portion barrel-aged for extra complexity."
Italy,90,49,Red Blend,red,Capezzana 1999 Ghiaie Della Furba Red (Tuscany),"Very much a baby, this is one big, bold, burly Cab-Merlot-Syrah blend that's filled to the brim with extracted plum fruit, bitter chocolate and earth. It takes a long time in the glass for it to lose its youthful, funky aromatics, and on the palate things are still a bit scattered. But in due time things will settle and integrate"
US,91,26,Chardonnay,white,Riverbench 2013 Estate Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"The nose is still emerging on this bottling by the historic estate, but nectarine, white and yellow flowers and a touch of cantaloupe are starting to peek out. The flavors dance between acidity and ripeness, with green apple flesh, lemon-lime peels and brisk minerality that build into a juicy finish."
US,88,45,Red Blend,red,Tre Nova 2008 Seccopassa Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This was fermented using dried Sangiovese and Barbera grapes, which were sourced from the Ciel du Cheval Vineyard on Red Mountain. Smooth and spicy, it has sweet tomato, red apple and Italian herb flavors, supported by firm acids."
US,88,30,Zinfandel,red,Sarah's Vineyard 2010 Old VIne Zinfandel (Santa Clara Valley),"The grape's brooding character is intensified in this old-vine bottling, with deep, brandy-like aromas of kirsch, cocoa syrup and spearmint. Tannins frame the heavy-duty palate profile, with extracted cherry, cola and vanilla flavorings decorating a firm, balancing structure."
US,88,11,Riesling,white,Pacific Rim 2014 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Mandarin orange, jasmine and honeysuckle aromas leap up. It drinks medium dry with a broad feel and a floral lift on the finish. The palate wants a bit more acid but this wine is appealing."
US,88,32,Zinfandel,red,Scott Harvey 2009 Old Vine Reserve Zinfandel (Amador County),"This is an austere, very structured, leathery Zin, with notes of briary black pepper and dark, ripe fruit from start to finish."
US,93,60,Red Blend,red,Beckmen 2013 TLB Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"The result of an accidental planting of these two varieties in the same block, this blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Syrah provides prime evidence why these two grapes make for a dynamic duo. Aromas of roasted coffee, black-cherry paste, Dr Pepper, vanilla and elderberry prove both juicy and elegant. With a silky mouthfeel and polished acidity, the palate is layered with blueberry, blackcurrant, tobacco, leather and dark-chocolate flavors."
US,88,70,Pinot Noir,red,Chateau St. Jean 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A generous expression of full-bodied fruit and oak, this wine is ripe in black cherry, plum and black licorice, robust and flavorful. The finish offers integrated tannins with a hint of cinnamon spice."
US,91,50,Chardonnay,white,Gary Farrell 2011 Rochioli-Allen Vineyards Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"New oak and ripe tropical fruit, peach and nectarine flavors mark this Chardonnay that is composed of fruit coming from a mix of vineyards in a warmer part of the Russian River Valley. Its zesty acidity gives it brightness, while barrel notes bring a creamy, yeasty complexity. Drink now."
France,89,21,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Saincrit 2012 Réserve  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"While the wood aging and toast do show, this wine is also rich. Black fruits give a juicy, flavorsome character, an opulence that is finished with some acidity. Drink from 2016."
US,92,45,Pinot Noir,red,WildAire 2012 Zenith Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"In the world of rare, single-vineyard Oregon Pinots, this is a relative bargain. The vineyard adjoins the St. Innocent winery, in a prime Eola-Amity location. The fruit delivers the subtle complexity and detail you hope for but don't always find in single-vineyard bottles. Brambly and floral with subtle notes of violets, rose petals, cured meat, orange rind and more, it's a dense and thought-provoking wine that rewards close attention."
US,87,50,Pinot Noir,red,Roar 2005 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Delicious in raspberries, cherries, sassafras, cola, orange blossom tea and vanilla, with a beautifully silky texture, this single-vineyard Pinot comes from low-yielding vines in the central part of the appellation. It's a little too soft for cellaring, but offers solid pleasure now."
US,92,42,Chardonnay,white,Dutton Estate 2008 Dutton Palms Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Super-rich in vanilla and smoky caramelized oak, and ripe in pineapples, peaches and apples, this is a powerful Chardonnay. It's dramatic now in sheer strength, but not an ager, so drink now."
US,94,150,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Notre Vin 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"A huge wine, almost old-fashioned in its tannins. They're so strong, they freeze the palate with astringency, like a shot of Novacaine. It's also very dry, despite sweetly ripe blackberry essence, licorice and dark chocolate. All indications are that this is an ageworthy wine. Should begin to throw sediment and mellow in seven or eight years, and could go the distance to 2020 and beyond."
US,93,135,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Betz Family 2012 Le Parrain Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"A rare reserve-level Cabernet only made once before, this 100% varietal wine hails from esteemed Kiona and Ciel du Cheval vineyards. Char and dark roasted coffee aromas meld with notes of herbs, spice and black fruit. The flavors are dense, layered and concentrated, but also show finesse and detail, with the palate broadening out considerably over time. The tannins are polished but still tightly wound and will benefit from an extended period in the cellar. Best from 2022 to 2028 but has the stuffing to get there and beyond."
France,86,20,Riesling,white,Helfrich 2015 Riesling (Alsace),"The subdued nose leads to a fresh, bright, easy-drinking palate dominated by lemony acidity. This is clean and refreshing. Drink soon."
US,92,28,Zinfandel,red,Ridge 1998 Lytton Springs Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A vineyard blend that includes 16% Petite Sirah, 2% Carignane, 4% Mataro and 1% Alicante Bouschet. Meaty, funky and ripe, with intense fruit, lots of earthy, barnyardy accents, and a long, tannic finish. This is old style Zin, no holds barred, with full-throttle flavors for aficionados."
US,86,15,Zinfandel,red,OZV 2008 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"A strongly briary old vine Zin from Lodi that's strangely restrained, with a taste of just-ripe blackberries that delves into bacon fat and mocha before falling off a tad at the finish. Decent volume and body on this wine, which is priced fairly and probably fairly easy to find."
US,86,26,Sangiovese,red,Danza del Sol 2011 Sangiovese (California),"Red cherry meets with tar, wet herbs and cinnamon stick on the nose of this wine. Framed by a decent tannic structure, the palate boasts flavors of more red cherry and thyme."
US,90,25,Chardonnay,white,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2008 Ethos Reserve Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The price on the Ethos Reserve has dropped significantly, making it an especially good value for a full-on, toasty and buttery Chardonnay. A harmonious mélange of tree fruits and tropical nuances—papaya and banana stand out—with a smooth and luscious mouthfeel."
US,90,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Shaw 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),"Aged four years in oak, this stately wine is adorned with layers of maple sugar, toast and smoked nuts, but its racy sour-cherry flavors shine through brightly. The backbone of this wine is taut with acidity, but bold, richly textured mouthfeel puts the palate at ease. It's sumptuous and revitalizing."
US,90,50,Pinot Noir,red,Bridlewood 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Dark strawberry mixes with allspice, incense and a touch of smoke on this wine's nose. Purple-flower flavors of lavender and violet mix with black raspberry, dried sage, ginger and black tea, all wrapped up in tart plum-peel tension."
US,88,32,Syrah,red,Northwest Cellars 2010 Coyote Canyon Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"This 100% varietal wine offers lightly volatile notes of vanilla, coconut, pepper and dried cherries. The fruit flavors show good concentration along with a beguiling feel and a finish that lingers. Although the wood takes center stage, it plays its part well."
US,89,40,Pinot Noir,red,King Estate 1999 Pfeiffer Vineyards Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Sweet fruit, pure and crystal clear defines this single-vineyard effort from King Estate. It's a crisp, tight Pinot with firm fruit and a concentrated, spicy middle. Nothing jammy or over the top, but well made and knit together. This is the third year they have made the wine, though just the second “official” release."
US,92,19,Chardonnay,white,Alma Rosa 2014 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"This bottling by pioneer Richard Sanford is much more widely available, affordable and stylistically accessible right now than the single vineyard option. It's delicate on the nose with bright lime spritz, Meyer lemon pith, crushed lemon verbena and a grippy brie cheese rind component, then proves tangy on the nuanced palate, with lemongrass and pomelo skin meshing into nectarine and apple flesh."
US,87,20,Chardonnay,white,Ironstone 2013 Reserve Estate Grown Chardonnay (Sierra Foothills),"This is not a showy wine, but the sense of reserve, good acidity, fresh flavors and good balance form an enjoyable picture that will be versatile with food."
Italy,88,12,Red Blend,red,Castello di Gabbiano 2010 Solatio Red (Toscana),"This is a lovely blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and a tiny part Sangiovese that shows dark fruit and spice with blackberry and rum cake at the back. The wine feel soft and plush on the palate."
US,87,32,Zinfandel,red,Horse & Plow 2012 Grist Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This lush, single-vineyard Zin floods the mouth with cola, blackberry jam, black pepper and toasty oak flavors. It's briary and brambly in character, and the alcohol is prominent, lending some prickly heat, but that's Dry Creek Zin for you. Enjoy it now with barbecue and rich meat stews."
US,86,10,Chardonnay,white,Rebusity 2012 Chardonnay (California),"A generous, smooth texture and nicely bright flavors of lemon, lime and apple make this a satisfying wine. It is medium to full bodied, soft in acidity, but fresh in flavor. It should be a winner for large groups."
France,83,14,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Bourbon 2010 Clos Bourbon  (Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux),Heavy toast aromas follow through to a wine that is packed with new wood and some fruit. It has a biting burnt edge that may soften.
US,87,20,Riesling,white,V. Sattui 2011 Dry Riesling (Napa Valley),"Although dry, it seems semisweet, with a honeyed richness to the peach, citrus and vanilla flavors. As Rieslings go, it's soft, compared to German versions, but easy to drink for a weekend brunch."
US,86,19,Chardonnay,white,Boomtown 2015 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),This wine brings aromas and flavors of pear along with light tropical accents. The concentration dips toward the finish.
US,92,58,Pinot Noir,red,MacPhail 2006 Pratt Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Quite a bit lighter in body than MacPhail's other single-vineyard '06s, this one benefits from the elegant structure. With its silky angularity, it offers complex flavors of cherries, raspberries, orange tea, vanilla, cinnamon, cloves and vanilla-rich new oak."
US,93,28,Merlot,red,Stevens 2008 Merlot (Yakima Valley),"As in past vintages, this is half DuBrul and half Meek vineyard fruit. It's a far cry from what most consumers would think of as Merlot—this is a stiff, tannic, muscular wine, with a deep earthiness that speaks of rich loam and ancient rock. It strikes me as more typical of Malbec. The tannins are firm and dense, and the fruits are black as coal and laced with tar and smoke."
US,85,10,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Concannon 2010 Selected Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Central Coast),"A fine wine, brisk in acidity and clean in the finish, with slightly sweet flavors of oranges, pears, peaches and honey. A nice cocktail sipper, or with Asian fare."
US,91,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Guardian 2012 The Rookie Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"A blend of Klipsun and Obelisco vineyards, this Cabernet Sauvignon leads with aromas of blackberry jam, espresso, fresh herbs and toasty barrel spices (60% new French). The black fruit flavors are rich, ripe and sweet, with the oak playing a prominent part in the show."
France,88,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Bertinerie 2011 Grande Cuvée  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"Attractive and smooth, this is a ripe, broad wine with its soft, juicy red berry fruits and supporting firm tannins. Balanced and fruity, it is ready to drink, finishing with a crisp texture of acidity."
US,82,13,Chardonnay,white,Congress Springs 2006 Chardonnay (California),"The structure on this wine is just fine, with crisp, coastal acidity and low alcohol making for a clean, well-balanced Chard. Its weakness is in the thinness of flavor. The wine is watery, with mere traces of citrus fruits and peaches."
US,90,27,Chardonnay,white,Iron Horse 2014 Unoaked Chardonnay (Green Valley),"With a clarity of fruit and minerality, this wine is brightly floral and noticeably stony, with highlights of melon, lemon and green apple."
US,87,27,Zinfandel,red,Pech Merle 2010 Treborce Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This has a powerful, briary character, with a spicy, high-alcohol kick. It erupts in the mouth, with flavors of wild berry, tobacco, cola, anise and white pepper that should pair well with equally spicy fare, preferably fatty meats and cheeses."
US,87,46,Pinot Noir,red,Sonoma-Cutrer 2012 Owsley Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A smokiness rises to the fore initially in this wine, a toasted oak accent that marks its character. From there, sour cherry and grenadine mix for an earthy celebration of red fruit before this full-bodied wine presents its tannins on the finish."
US,87,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Kokomo 2013 Timber Crest Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),"Fermented in both tank and new acacia barrels, there's definitely a depth of woodiness on the opening aromas. This is followed by a creaminess of texture on the palate, the taste leaning toward pear, vanilla and fresh melon. The finish is first creamy, then crisp, veering on spritzy."
US,91,55,Pinot Noir,red,Soléna 2014 Hyland Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"Young, spicy and forward, this immediately accessible wine is a bowl of cherry candy, backed with pineapple highlights from natural acidity. It's full in the mouth, still with primary fruit flavors, but the structure to age gracefully over the next five to eight years."
France,96,250,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Trotanoy 2005  Pomerol,"Certainly it is firm, with impressive power. But the smoothness of the ripe black fruits as they combine with the beautifully judged wood show a contrast of tension with the dense, chewy core. At its heart, this wine is dark and solid and concentrated, promising long aging."
US,86,10,Chardonnay,white,ecoVINO 2010 AstraPouch Chardonnay (Mendocino County),"A 100%-organic Chardonnay, stainless steel fermented and poured into a handy-dandy, also certified-organic AstraPouch (1.5 liter). This easy-to-bring-on-a-picnic wine is clean, balanced and simply drinkable with a note of sweet grapefruit and pineapple."
US,88,20,Riesling,white,Lamoreaux Landing 2009 Yellow Dog Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),"From start to finish, there's so much going on with Lamoreaux Landing's Yellow Dog. Honey and orange blossom aromas are laced with a whisper of musk. The bright lemon-lime sweetness is balanced elegantly with a distinct minerality evocative of smoke, slate and stone, and a bracing acidity that drives a lingering finish."
France,83,12,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Léo de la Gaffelière 2012  Bordeaux,This is a thin wine with way too much acidity for the fruit. The rest of the wine is dry tannin that could soften into a more juicy character. It's always going to be a light wine.
France,92,42,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Vincent Pinard 2014  Sancerre,"This is a smooth, rich wine with just the right amount of tannic structure and wood flavors to add complexity. It has density along with red berry and black-cherry fruits that are lifted by acidity. It's a wine for aging, so don't drink before 2018."
US,93,80,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Mueller Family Vineyards 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"A wine that's had some time to find itself in bottle, this opens in a wildness of mountain tannin and dusty texture, grippy and dry on the palate. Cedar, tobacco and shy black fruit call out for braised red meat, with a structure that should hold up longer in the cellar if necessary."
US,91,40,Merlot,red,Anthony Nappa 2013 Reserve Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"Fleshy, sun-kissed black plums and cherries abound in this supple, velvet-textured Merlot. It's mouthfilling and rich, but brisk cranberry acidity lends firm structure. The palate is subtly nuanced, marked by soft tannins and layers of brambly wood, cedar and baking spice. Aged 19 months with a large proportion of new French oak, it drinks well now but should meld beautifully from 2020–2028."
France,83,18,Chardonnay,white,Domaine des Deux Roches 2013 Plants Carré  (Mâcon-Villages),"This is a wine with harshness, sharp walnut and bitter orange flavors. It gives off a hard feeling that probably won't soften much."
US,84,28,Chardonnay,white,Manzanita Creek 2014 Fantozzi Vineyard Chardonnay (Los Carneros),"This is a diluted, straightforward wine dotted in pleasing layers of pear and papaya. It finishes clean and quick."
US,88,28,Syrah,red,Astrale e Terra 2004 Estate Syrah (Atlas Peak),"At the age of five-plus, this is still a pretty aggressive wine in tannins, with a sandpapery astringency through the finish. But it's also incredibly fruity, offering a blast of superripe blackberries, currants, plums, dark chocolate and pepper. Seems best now and for a couple years."
US,85,28,Pinot Noir,red,Verotto 2006 Juliet Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Good, if a bit heavy and dull. Tastes like an older wine, with soft cherry, cocoa, licorice, spice and dried fruit flavors. Drink now."
France,89,32,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Bardins 2010  Pessac-Léognan,"The wine shows the firmly tannic structure of the vintage. It is dense, packed with dark fruits and dry tannins that are slowly developing. That makes for a rich, black-fruited wine, concentrated and needing to age further. Drink from 2018."
US,86,28,Pinot Noir,red,Miro 2010 Floodgate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A big, ripe, fruity Pinot Noir, this is basically an orchard in a glass, with flavors of raspberries, cherries, persimmons and more. Beyond that, it's dry and soft. Drink now."
US,87,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Spann Vineyards 2007 The Classic Four Red (Sonoma Valley),"This is a Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, and it's very good, especially for the price. Smooth and soft, it offers lush blackberry, red currant, cherry, chocolate and herb flavors that are drinking well now."
US,87,19,Chardonnay,white,Wölffer 2015 Chardonnay (Long Island),"Curious whiffs of raspberry and pink grapefruit lend a particularly fruity, forward tone to this medium-bodied Chardonnay. It's easy drinking and plush in mouthfeel but brightened by sunny grapefruit and tangerine acidity. Drink now through 2019."
US,89,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Jade Moon 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Blackberry, dill, thyme, oregano, bay leaf, roasted fennel and the slightest touch of green pepper show on the nose of this well-aged bottling. Similar elements extend to the palate, where the herbal influence gives intrigue to a backdrop of blackberry and elderberry fruit. Strong acidity ensures even more life."
US,84,36,Merlot,red,Saddleback 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Dry and harsh, almost old-fashioned in its tannic astringency, with a green kick of mint. Relieved by a streak of black cherries and cedar. Drink now."
US,91,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Seven Hills 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The Cabernet is stiffened up with small amounts of Petit Verdot, Cab Franc and Malbec, resulting in a firm, herbal, but very well-balanced Bordeaux-style blend. There's compact cassis fruit, streaked with light stem, earth and herb. This is a wine that should improve with bottle age through 2019."
Italy,88,22,Sangiovese,red,Villa Vignamaggio 2007 Gherardino  (Chianti Classico),"This Chianti Classico is composed of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot. This last variety really shines through, rendering jammy aromas of cherry and blackberry followed by dense, chewy fruit."
Italy,92,190,Red Blend,red,Pasqua 2006 Famiglia Pasqua Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella),"This 90th anniversary edition boasts enticing aromas of baked plum, crushed violet, new leather, French oak and a whiff of pipe tobacco. The firm concentrated palate presents layers of dried blackberry, black cherry extract, licorice and cake spice framed in assertive fine-grained tannins. Give it a few more years to fully develop. Drink through 2018–2026."
US,89,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Laurel Glen 2011 Counterpoint Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Mountain),"What a nice wine for drinking now. The second wine of esteemed Laurel Glen, it's made from 100% Cabernet. The grapes from Sonoma County have been joined by fruit from Napa Valley, resulting in plenty of blackberry and cherry richness. With classy tannins, it's a great success for the chilly 2011 vintage."
France,91,80,Syrah,red,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 2009 Domaine de Roure  (Crozes-Hermitage),"If the oak integrates better and recedes more into the fruit than I suspect, this rating will look conservative. Right now, oak is front and center, arrayed in ranks of toasted cedar and vanilla. It's full bodied and chewy in texture, with a long, plushly oaky finish. Try after 2015."
France,85,12,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Le Petit Panier 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de France),"A fine and ripe wine with touches of black currant and more flourishes of red berry flavors. It is structured, although that doesn't remove its immediate drinkability. The aftertaste is softer, just off dry."
US,91,28,Chardonnay,white,Sinclair Estate Vineyards 2010 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Very much in line with SEV's fine 2009 Chardonnay, this is sourced from the Lewis Vineyard. Instantly round and fruity, it offers up a ripe mix of oranges and apricots, backed with juicy acidity. Then it brings in the butter, toast and nuts—a full-bodied, extremely generous wine."
US,85,150,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Notre Vin 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Although this Cab is nearly seven years old, it's still hard and tough in tannins, and the tart acidity suggests it will remain unbalanced for the rest of its life. If you can get past the sharpness, it has dry flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants."
US,83,8,Merlot,red,Domino 2012 Merlot (California),"For eight bucks you get a decent Merlot. It's dry and medium-bodied, with jammy blackberry and cherry flavors. Fine to drink with burgers, tacos, pizza."
US,87,125,Syrah,red,Sanguis 2012 1/1 Syrah (Central Coast),"This one-barrel bottling is quite intriguing, offering unexpected aromas and flavors. An element of crunched grapeseeds and unfermented wine grapes mixes with licorice, olive and pepper on the nose. A similar sense pervades the palate, along with light coffee and brown tea flavors. It's slightly odd, but also an interesting change of pace."
US,92,30,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Grieve 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),This is a gorgeously floral and herbal wine nuanced in curvy minerality that both defines it and allows it to support lovely accents of apricot and peach.
US,93,68,Pinot Noir,red,B Cellars 2014 Manzana Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Farmed by the Dutton family, this vineyard offers a generosity of fruit and depth, the nose perfumed in rose and lavender. Grippy texture lies atop a robust density and luxurious mouthfeel, the rich roundness never overwhelmed but instead kept fresh in bright acidity."
US,89,24,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),"Aged in a combination of French, American and Hungarian oak for 14 months, Hazlitt's Cabernet balances ripe, rich blackberry flavor with toasty hints of graham cracker and soft velvety tannins that coat the palate. Crisp yet concentrated, it finishes long with soft notes of dried herbs."
US,85,15,Chardonnay,white,Lockwood 2013 San Lucas Unoaked Pure Chardonnay (San Lucas),"Slightly sour elements of lemon and lime meet with a riper nectarine tone on the nose of this wine. There is good citrus-driven acidity on the palate with limeade flavors, though it trends a bit sour and wipes up with not much finish."
US,89,17,Chardonnay,white,Jekel 2014 Gravelstone Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),"Buttercream, sea salt, caramel and lemon candy aromas show on the nose of this solid bottling. The flavors are full but not overly ripe, with yellow apple, poached pear, white peach and a sea salt character that keeps it mouthwatering."
France,93,225,Pinot Noir,red,Bouchard Père & Fils 2006  Chapelle-Chambertin,"Initially round, this develops a strong minerality, with a texture that is firm and dominating ripe fruit. There is definite austerity here. The wine is at present firm and tough, and needs several years to open up."
US,85,13,Chardonnay,white,Lakewood 2006 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"For lovers of the big California Chardonnays, this wine delivers. Bold aromas of buttery spice lead into full flavors of cream, butter and spice. The wine offers complexity and unfolds nicely on the palate. A white that can handle rich dishes and can age."
US,82,24,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Frisby 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Has a sulfur and funk aroma and taste that don't blow off even after plenty of decanting. The underlying wine is pretty good, but it's flawed by cellar influences."
US,86,34,White Blend,white,Browne Family Vineyards 2015 & White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Bright aromas of ripe peach, apricot, flower and jasmine lead to off-dry stone fruit flavors in this simple, straightforward quaffer."
US,91,65,Pinot Noir,red,Nicholson Ranch 2014 Cactus Hill Estate Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Spicy, this full-bodied wine is tart in cherry and piquant in baking spices, able to retain a lively and fresh palate within the weightier proceedings. It has a brooding, brushy underbelly of forest-floor pine."
France,95,34,Riesling,white,Trimbach 2013 Réserve Riesling (Alsace),"Pure citrus zest rises from the glass: lovely, ripe lemon and zesty lime. The palate reinforces these flavors in a rapier-like fashion, with drive and energy in a very linear energetic way. This seem like an elixir or a tonic full of vim, all informed by a central dynamic freshness. This has barely blossomed but promises much future pleasure. This genie should be contained in its bottle for a while longer before letting it loose. It's something to look forward to. Drink 2020–2035."
US,86,13,Zinfandel,red,Truant 2010 Old Vine Zinfandel (California),"Rich and layered in cherries, red currants, pepper and gingerbread, this Zin has soft, lush tannins and a spicy finish. It's a good wine to drink with barbecue."
US,92,50,Syrah,red,Walla Walla Vintners 2014 Estate Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This wine's aromas are a bit locked up at present, revealing plum, herb, clove and barrel spice notes as it opens. The palate is dense and rich, full of dark fruit flavors and generous barrel accents. It pulls no punches."
US,92,32,Sangiovese,red,La Folia Winery 2011 Sangiovese (Sierra Foothills),"Another stunning Sangiovese from La Folia, it's fruity and soft. A smooth, velvety juiciness lingers through the midpalate and into the finish. Balanced in richness and texture, this is a beautiful fulfillment of what many have hoped for years could be possible with the grape in California."
US,85,25,Chardonnay,white,Clos Pegase 2007 Mitsuko's Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),"The oak contributes buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel flavors to this dry, crisp wine, but the underlying fruit isn't strong enough to support all that weight. Shows only modest flavors of pineapples, kiwis and minerals. Disappointing."
France,89,32,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Bellerose Figeac 2007 Cuvée Tradition  (Saint-Émilion),"With its dry, tight texture, this is an austere wine. The fruit is full of piercing black currant acidity, structured with firm tannins. Smoky wood does give an extra dimension, but the wine needs several months more in bottle."
France,88,20,Chardonnay,white,Domaine des Terres Dorées 2013  Beaujolais Blanc,"Smooth, creamy and round, this offers mango, peach and fresher grapefruit flavors, well integrated into its full-bodied texture. With its delicious rich feel, it has weight as well as final acidity."
France,91,36,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Leflaive 2008  Mâcon-Verze,"An impressively full wine, its ripe apricot flavors melding seamlessly into rich wood and concentrated flavors. The lemon acidity enlivens the ripe yellow fruits, leaving a rich final impression."
Italy,95,460,Merlot,red,Tenuta dell'Ornellaia 2005 Masseto Merlot (Toscana),"Fruit was picked later than normal and the Masseto Merlot does indeed show mature aromas of black cherry, ripe blackberry, earthy iron and polished stone. The intensity and purity are amazing and the wine is sophisticated, soft and very rich on the finish. It is already showing beautiful evolution in the glass."
Italy,87,12,Red Blend,red,Cantele 2004 Riserva Red (Salice Salentino),Here's a pretty Riserva Salice Salentino (a blend of Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera) with vibrant tones of spice and mature fruit. The wine's flavors are chewy and dense and fuel the wine's lush texture.
US,83,35,Pinot Noir,red,Johan Vineyards 2007 Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Thin, dilute, with a minty, unripe character, and hard-as-nails tannins."
France,93,45,Chardonnay,white,Albert Bichot 2015 Domaine Long-Depaquit Les Vaillons Premier Cru  (Chablis),"This young, textured wine shows a mix of strong minerality and ripe white fruits. The Albert Bichot Chablis domaine has a fine parcel from this premier cru. Refreshing citrus and tight acidity contrast with the warmer vanilla and yellow fruits. Drink from 2021."
US,89,89,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Bougetz 2012 Prominence Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This dense, tannic and concentrated wine needs more time in the bottle. It features aromas of flint and dried herb, with similar flavors on the palate. With pronounced oak, it's expansive and rich. Cellar through 2020."
US,88,40,Pinot Noir,red,La Crema 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Call this Pinot useful, rather than complex or ageable. It's nicely dry, acidic and silky in the mouth, with jammy raspberry, cherry and persimmon flavors. Food pairings range from steak to tuna tartare or a bacon burger."
France,85,18,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Acker-Perreau 2010  Bordeaux,"This is a fruity, ready-to-drink wine, with acidity cutting through the juicy black currant fruits. This is attractive and bright, yet structured."
US,87,25,Pinot Noir,red,Black Star Farms 2012 Arcturos Pinot Noir (Michigan),"Muddled raspberries and shades of darker berries carry over a smoky background on the nose. The light-bodied palate shows a round, silky texture, with red cherry and savory, herbal tones. A persistent stream of acidity carries everything along to a lingering, fruit-tinged finish."
US,87,17,Syrah,red,Barnard Griffin 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Streaks of citrus, berry and cracker are integrated with light berry flavors. This is a smooth, balanced, easy-drinking Syrah, with light hints of tea leaves."
US,84,28,Zinfandel,red,Benessere 2008 Estate Black Glass Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"A big disappointment, not up there with some previous vintages of this estate bottling. But the price has been lowered considerably on this simple wine. It's unbalanced, with some vegetal flavors. Ready now."
Italy,91,20,Pinot Grigio,white,Abbazia di Novacella 2013 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige Valle Isarco),"Enticing fragrances suggest alpine wild flower, stone fruit and savory herb. The linear palate is loaded with finesse and character, delivering creamy green apple, tangerine, mineral, white peach and mint. It's well balanced with bright acidity."
US,88,54,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Pine Ridge 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Lots of tough, old-fashioned tannins on this pugnacious young Cabernet. While it has a good core of blackberries and currants, it's pretty brutal on the palate. Hard to tell if the fruit will outlast the astringency. Try after 2018."
US,88,21,Zinfandel,red,Balletto 2006 Estate Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Stick this in a blind tasting with Pinot Noir and you might not be able to tell the difference. That's because it's a lighter-bodied Zin, and also because Pinots these days are heavier and riper. It has a silky texture, with rich, long-lasting flavors of cherries, raspberries, licorice, vanilla, wintergreen and cinnamon spice."
France,89,140,Pinot Noir,red,L. Tramier & Fils 2015 Collection Tramier  (Corton),This still-young wine is jammy while firmly structured with dry tannins. There is a foursquare character that misses subtlety with its broad-brush approach. The wine does need to age and will be ready to drink from 2023.
Italy,88,13,Red Blend,red,Stemmari 2012 Cantodoro Red (Terre Siciliane),"A blend of 80% Nero d'Avola and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, this delivers ripe blackberry, black cherry, red currant and vanilla flavors with a hint of mocha. Firm, round tannins balance the juicy palate."
US,88,18,Pinot Noir,red,Pietra Santa 2012 Estate Pinot Noir (Cienega Valley),"From a limestone-laden vineyard 25 miles east of the cool Monterey Bay comes a solid wine redolent with notes of black cherry, toasted sage, cedar and cinnamon. It's big and tannic on the palate, with flavors of blackberry syrup, black licorice and espresso."
US,83,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Gamache 2013 Estate Select Gamache Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas of butter and vanilla overwhelm any sense of the variety. The oak remains out-front on the palate, which seems broad but lacks the acidity to hold it together."
US,92,28,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Jade Moon 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Heavy duty purple aromas of blackberry chiffon and blueberry pudding are lifted by a strong dill element on this darkly layered bottling. Baked blueberries meet with black olives, more dill and cut oregano, held together by a strong tannic structure."
US,90,58,Zinfandel,red,Seghesio 2012 Estate Home Ranch Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"Dry and refined in fine-grained tannin, this long-standing vineyard-designate dances in black leather and brambly blackberry, which expand gradually on the palate, peppered by baking spices. Soft and velvety, the finish lingers in spice."
US,94,52,Pinot Noir,red,Brick House 2014 Les Dijonnais Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"Happily, production of Les Dijonnais has climbed to 800 cases, while the quality remains as good as ever. This smooth and supple wine is velvety in the mouth, with flavors of raspberry, blue plum and black cherry. Its palate-pleasing thickness carries a vein of licorice and dark chocolate. Drink now through 2025."
US,92,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Armida 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Just 10% of this wine was fermented in new French oak which adds a bit of weight and length. Grapefruit, peach and lime mingle on the palate, a briny afterthought providing an edge. Smooth and refreshing, it ends in a long dream of lemon."
US,92,38,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Zinke 2012 Gypsy Thompson Vineyard Red (Santa Barbara County),"From winemaker Michael Zinke, this is yet another stylish Rhône-style blend. Aromas of boysenberry, plum, tar, black peppercorn and lavender delicately lay across the nose. The palate presents very judiciously and evenly, with dried purple flowers, black tea, slight teriyaki and just a touch of plum."
France,89,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Lamour 2009 Réserve  (Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux),"Big, brooding and ripe, this is packed with a blackberry flavor that is laced through the bitter chocolate and mocha notes and dark tannins. It is powerful and concentrated, smooth and dark tasting."
US,87,16,Pinot Noir,red,Calera 2009 Vin Gris of Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"Although this is a rosé, it provides an early glimpse, and a promising one, into the highly anticipated '09 Pinot vintage. Ripe and fruity in cherries, vanilla and spices, the wine shows great finesse and style."
US,91,38,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Chateau Rollat 2008 Rollat Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Sweet barrel flavors set off pretty fruit, a generous mix of cherries and berries, with juicy underlying acidity. This wine needs quite a bit more time to unfold. For the moment, all the components are right but the integration is not complete."
US,88,85,Red Blend,red,Padis 2012 Scintillation Proprietary Red (Napa Valley),"This blend combines 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Syrah. Fat, juicy and tart, it's robust in oak and meaty leather, its tannin profile grippy and tight. A background note of dried herb and cedar add to the classic touch in style."
US,84,18,Sangiovese,red,Barra of Mendocino 2010 Estate Grown Sangiovese (Mendocino),"There's a cinnamon and clove sweetness in aroma of this Sangiovese, which would be a fine accompaniment to pizza or pasta during the week."
US,84,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Red Newt Cellars 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),"Aromas of cedar and black cherry syrup are sweet on the nose, but the black fruit character on the palate could use a boost of intensity and depth. Lean in profile, it's pleasantly brisk, but fades away a bit too fast."
US,93,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hoopes 2013 Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is sophisticated stuff that lives up to Oakville's reputation. It tastes rich and alluring from the first whiff of black currant and espresso to the ultrasmooth mouthfeel and elegant finish. Think extra-fine tannins, opulent currant, dark chocolate and black cherry flavors. Enjoy it now or save through 2023 to encourage even more bouquet."
US,84,24,Pinot Noir,red,Peacock Cellars 2011 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"This light-bodied Pinot has some good raspberry and cherry pie flavors, as well as bright acidity. Decant to let it breathe, and drink now."
US,90,39,Chardonnay,white,Beringer 2012 Luminus Chardonnay (Oak Knoll District),"Beringer reaches into the cool, southerly Oak Knoll district of Napa Valley for this dry Chardonnay, which shows tart flavors of lemons, apples, limes and minerals. It's an elegant Chard, light but complex, with beautiful acidity and just a touch of oak. Dungeness crab with buttered sourdough bread would be a perfect pairing."
France,89,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Bel-Air 2009  Lussac Saint-Émilion,"While the wine has some richness, it is also firmly structured, with a minerally severity from its tight tannins. Under the surface, there is a fruity character that's dominated by a juicy black-currant flavor."
US,91,40,Merlot,red,Northstar 2008 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine gets the all-star treatment, blending fruit from 14 vineyards, and aging it in 60% new French oak. It's a substantial, muscular effort, with dark fruit, earth and tar components. A small addition of Petit Verdot darkens the color and thickens the tannins. There is just a hint of alcoholic burn in the finish."
US,86,25,Pinot Noir,red,Alouette 2011 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"An easy Pinot that shows the variety's silky texture ripe, with sunny flavors of cherries and cola. It's ripe, and fine for drinking now."
US,84,30,Pinot Noir,red,Greenwood Ridge 2009 Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge),"Greenwood suggests cellaring this wine for four years but in the meantime it's more baked bread than earthy, red fruit and pretty high in acidity."
France,84,12,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Bellevue 2011  Bordeaux,"A soft, rather soapy wine, it displays light fruits and gentle tannins. It is unfocused, with just some juicy aftertaste to give some interest."
US,86,19,Chardonnay,white,Veramar 2011 Estate Club Reserva Chardonnay (Virginia),"This has mild, one-dimensional scents of apple and Meyer lemon. The medium-bodied palate has fresh acidity, and shows a touch more depth than the nose with the added note of glazed white apricot."
US,88,13,Chardonnay,white,Glenora 2015 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Pristine fruity touches of fresh apple, pear and lemon shine in this unoaked Chardonnay. Full bodied and round, it's an easy approachable wine with soft sunny acidity. The finish lingers on a bright lemon-candy note."
Italy,87,37,White Blend,white,Zuani 2014 Riserva White (Collio),"Pressed acacia flower, moist earth and aromatic herb scents mingle with fresh orchard fruit ntoes. The vibrant, ethereal palate is spare and subtle, offering yellow apple, tangy citrus and toasted nut nuances, with racy acidity."
US,90,35,Chardonnay,white,Lincourt 2014 Carol Ann Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Clean and crisp lines of sea salt and lemon zest meet with caramelized white peach and pear on the nose of this bottling from the Foley family. The palate's chalky texture delivers richer flavors of baked yellow pears, cinnamon and baking spice."
US,91,60,Pinot Noir,red,Elk Cove 2015 Mount Richmond Pinot Noir,"This wine's cranberry, raspberry and cherry flavors are spicy and tart, carrying a suggestion of hard candy. It's consistent throught its tart finish and promises much development ahead. Drink now through the late 2020s."
US,94,85,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Daou 2014 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Adelaida District),"Viscous and dark in the glass, this can be none other than a Daou wine. The telltale crème de cassis, black cherry, mocha and espresso aromas lead to a palate of exotic black spice and concentrated fruit, its blackberry and blueberry flavors accented with hoisin notes. It has enough structure to age but is also accessible now."
US,94,45,Chardonnay,white,Chateau St. Jean 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"The winery's reserve Chard has consistently been the best among their five Chards. The '05 is a dramatic wine, although oak-o-phobes might find it toothpicky. It is smoky and buttery and caramelly, but a year or so should knit that together with the ripe tropical fruits and make the wine seamlessly complex."
France,95,125,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Pontet-Canet 2008  Pauillac,"Smooth, with dense tannins hidden behind the ripe, pure fruit, this important wine shows class and an impeccable balance of fruit and tannin. Rich as well as structured, this is a beautiful wine."
US,87,35,Pinot Noir,red,Foxen 2015 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This appellation blend is nowhere near as amazing as the winery's single-vineyard expressions from this vintage, but it'll work for an everyday sipper. Light red cherry meets with damp herbs, wet hay and forest floor on the nose, while the simple palate combines red fruit with more herbs and orange peels."
US,92,60,Pinot Noir,red,Ayoub 2013 Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Six clones are blended into this wine, an elegant and aromatic style of Pinot Noir. With breathing time it adds volume, showing more heft and complexity. The pretty red fruits are set in a frame that shows more minerality than tannin."
US,88,18,Riesling,white,Tempus Cellars 2015 Evergreen Vineyard Riesling (Ancient Lakes),"Coming from the state's premier Riesling vineyard, this wine opens with lightly styled aromas of slate, apricot and peach. It drinks a hair off dry, with honeyed stone-fruit flavors."
France,94,45,Riesling,white,Domaine Pfister 2014 Engelberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"The nose is rather restrained but the palate comes alive with ripe lemon and zesty tangerine. This is dry and concentrated, with a lovely vein of lemon freshness that pervades and brightens the entire experience. Prepare to be refreshed. This is luminous, fresh and so illustrative of the 2014 vintage: A challenge that yielded such jewels in the right hands. Lovely now but with ample mileage. Drink 2017–2037"
US,87,15,Riesling,white,Hosmer 2012 Riesling (Cayuga Lake),"Richly concentrated with ripe tropical melons and mangoes, this juicy, fruity, off-dry Riesling is a straightforward yet undeniably tasty pick. It's zesty and fresh, with tart tangerine acidity that wraps the finish up crisply."
US,89,25,Riesling,white,Ravines 2008 Argetsinger Vineyard Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"If you're looking for a truly bone-dry Riesling from the Finger Lakes, look no further than Ravines. It's uncharacteristically austere for the region, with a lean, light body and a mineral laden, wet-stone palate. Lots of freshly squeezed lime juice and a citrus rind finish makes this an elegant, drinkable choice."
US,91,39,Pinot Noir,red,Huett 2015 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This wine is well-rounded, lightly toasty, and soft on the palate. Flavors of butter cream, blueberry and cherry pie make it a hedonistic delight that's perfect for immediate enjoyment."
US,90,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Canvasback 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"The aromas of blue fruit, herbs and spice are initially under tight restraint. The flavors are full, with the tannins simultaneously firm and fine grained. It shows good length."
US,90,45,Chardonnay,white,Expression 38 2014 Gap's Crown Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Lemon mousse aromas and flavors provide the richness and allure of this wine, as steely acidity keeps it fresh and vibrant. Full-bodied, it continues to taste strongly of Gravenstein apple and nutmeg and is bolstered by toasted oak."
Italy,87,23,Sangiovese,red,Pietro Beconcini 2009 Riserva  (Chianti),"This deep and dark Chianti riserva opens with slightly oxidized aromas of candied fruit and raspberry roll-up. Cola, dark spice and bresaola round off the finish."
France,86,13,Red Blend,red,Cave du Marmandais 2015 Richard 1er Red (Côtes du Marmandais),"The Abouriou, which forms a small part of the blend of this wine, is one of those many Southwest grapes that has been rescued from a sad decline. It adds a richly perfumed character to the Bordeaux blend in this grape. Attractive, with young tannins and ripe black fruits, it will age well. Drink from 2018."
US,89,17,Syrah,red,Barnard Griffin 2014 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Immediate in its appeal, this young wine is redolent with aromas of blueberry and huckleberry pie. The blue-fruit flavors are saturated and smooth in feel, trailing a touch toward the finish."
US,90,32,Chardonnay,white,Trione 2011 River Road Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Sultry pear and baked apple are the stars. Lemony and creamy on the palate, this offers slight hints of honey and tropical fruit. It boasts a long finish and robust yet restrained oak that should relax in time."
US,88,57,Pinot Noir,red,Séamus Wines 2014 Doctor's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Dried black cherry, shaved chocolate and dried herb aromas show on the nose of this bottling from a producer based in Marietta, Georgia. Fat flavors of cocoa and black cherry mousse make for a compelling sip."
US,86,50,Pinot Noir,red,Loring Wine Company 2006 Russell Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Paso Robles),"Dark, soft, full-bodied and slightly sweet, this Pinot clearly shows its warm-climate origins. It tastes of jammy blackberries, cherries and raspberries."
US,90,29,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cedarville Vineyard 2010 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (El Dorado),"Fully ripe, saturated fruit aromas lead to deep, lush flavors and a smooth, moderately tannic texture. The wine lets dried plum flavors shine through without a lot of oak tones, so it tastes focused and pure. It keeps improving with each sip. Best now through 2019."
US,88,44,Syrah,red,Bunnell 2010 Discovery Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"This cool-vintage wine offers aromas of vanilla, coconut, barrel spice, clove and red fruit. The palate is full of restrained cranberry flavors that show persistence."
France,95,440,Chardonnay,white,Louis Latour 2009  Montrachet,"The grandest of all white Burgundy vineyards, Montrachet has produced a powerful, great wine, with impressive ripe, dense fruit. There is still elegance, a sense of proportion, but the opulence of the Chardonnay here is impossible to resist."
US,91,22,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cameron Hughes 2007 Lot 149 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Give this young Cabernet a good decant before you serve, because it's a big, brooding wine that needs some air to open up. Right out of the bottle, it's tannic and dry, and the blackberry and black currant flavors are buried under a blanket of astringency. But it's quite a good, well-made wine."
US,88,42,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Dominus 2005 Napanook Red (Yountville),"A very nice Cabernet-based wine from Dominus, the '05 Napanook is a shade less elegant than in the last few vintages, but is still a lush, attractive young wine. Filled with the flavors of ripe blackberries, black currants, tar, chocolate, cedar and pepper, its tannins are hard and a little astringent. Give it a few years or serious decanting."
US,89,40,Chardonnay,white,Armida 2010 Durell Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"This is a flashy Chardonnay that's meant to impress. Big, oaky and ripe, this bears opulent waves of mangoes, papayas and apricots, with notes of buttered toast and sweet caramel. Not particularly subtle, but a crowd pleaser."
US,88,30,Chardonnay,white,Ryan Patrick 2014 Reserve Bacchus Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Bright aromas of vanilla, toast and wood spice lead to a full-bodied, rich palate. The style gets out in front of the fruit but there's still much to enjoy."
US,90,11,Riesling,white,Sawtooth 2011 Riesling,"Spicy and substantial, this authoritative Riesling snaps into tight focus around apple and melon flavors. Hints of clove and ginger add complexity."
Italy,88,30,Red Blend,red,Canonica a Cerreto 2012  Chianti Classico,"Aromas of cassis, chopped herb and licorice lead the nose and carry over to the medium-bodied palate along with dried cherry and espresso. Fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit."
US,91,52,Pinot Noir,red,Rex Hill 2009 La Colina Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"There is a nice lift to the aromas, which focus on sweet black-cherry fruit. Streaks of cola and brown sugar come into play in the mouth, but the rich fruit is the star of the show."
France,95,45,Riesling,white,Domaine Pfister 2012 Engelberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"There is something heady about this: a hint of chamomile tincture and pure lemon zest. The palate cuts in with uncompromising purity and zestiness—this really wants to showcase pure stone and tart citrus. There are glimpses, however, of plump ripe mirabelle plums and a touch of dried pear and quince. Nonetheless, this is governed by stern tanginess and thus is for real adults only. This is dry, slender and shows absolute focus. A celebration of stone and Riesling. Don't drink this now but wait: Drink 2020–2035."
US,88,20,White Blend,white,Testa Vineyards NV Simply White White (Mendocino County),"This is a nonvintage blend of Chenin Blanc and Sauvignon Blanc, with additions of Viognier and Muscat. Its Chenin-like nose is floral and rich, and its lychee, lime and kiwi flavors swirl about before coming to a refined, perfectly crisp finish."
US,86,35,Red Blend,red,Kuleto Estate 2009 India Ink Red (Napa Valley),"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this is soft and rich. It's forward in blackberries, cherries, dried currants and mocha flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. Drink it now before the fruit fades away."
US,88,36,Zinfandel,red,Peachy Canyon 2010 Vortex Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Made in the Peachy Canyon style, this Zin, which contains some Petite Sirah, is very high in alcohol. It's sweet, hot and soft. The blueberry, blackberry and chocolate flavors are almost in dessert wine territory, but it's a very good example of its genre."
US,85,8,Chardonnay,white,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2014 Chardonnay (California),"This wine has a lighter-than-usual color, fresh aromas like cucumbers and jicama, and clean, straightforward apple flavors backed by good, crisp acidity. It's simply good and refreshing."
France,90,17,Riesling,white,Dopff & Irion 2014 Riesling (Alsace),"Beautiful and appetizing notes of Cox Orange Pippin apples shine. The palate is zesty, sprightly and textured, and shows pure fruit—a combination that spells ideal refreshment. The lemony fillip on the finish is lip-smacking."
US,90,26,Zinfandel,red,Ottimino Vineyards 2006 Rancho Bello Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"A wildly flavored, tannic and exuberant Zinfandel that showcases the variety's exotic personality. Dry and full-bodied, it has brambly flavors of blackberries, black currants, licorice, mocha and smoky cedar, liberally sprinkled with dusty Asian spices. Drink now–2013."
France,87,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Saransot-Dupré 2012  Listrac-Médoc,"One of Bordeaux's more memorable labels (orange nymphs supporting a picture of the chateau), Saransot-Dupré is one of a number of chateaus in Listrac with the Dupré suffix. This is a solid wine, chunky in a typical way for the appellation with plenty of black fruits and balanced tannins. Drink from 2017."
US,93,60,Syrah,red,Betz Family 2014 La Serenne Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Coming from one of the state's most esteemed Syrah sites, this wine opens with high-toned aromas of herb, blue fruit and iron, along with light savory accents. The flavors are full, broad and palate coating, showing an exquisite sense of balance and length that kicks it up a notch. Exquisite stuff."
US,85,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Windsor Sonoma 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Very soft and direct in plummy black currant flavors that are so ripe, they veer into plumped raisins and prunes. The wine is fully dry, with refined tannins. Drink now."
France,86,30,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Grand Bireau 2010  Bordeaux,"With wood and black currant aromas, this is a soft, ripe and ready to drink wine. It has a rich texture, with a smokiness and black fruits that are smoothed by wood and lifted by acidity."
US,91,25,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Amici 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This light, bright and remarkably floral white from the Musqué clone impresses in its balance and lingering mouthfeel. Subtle flavors of nectarine and peach invite one in and become more pronounced in the glass over time, providing refreshment and elegance."
US,84,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hess 2005 Allomi Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This basic Cab shows blackberry, currant and oak flavors wrapped into firm tannins. It's a sound, good wine, with a briary, rustic edge. Drink now."
Italy,88,13,Red Blend,red,Cavit 2009 Alta Luna Phases Red (Vigneti delle Dolomiti),"A blend of Teroldego, Lagrein and Merlot, this well-priced Italian opens with inky, dark concentration and loads of ripe fruit, blackberry and cinnamon. Nicely balanced, it's not too bold or overextracted."
US,89,25,Merlot,red,Northwest Collection 2010 Limited Release Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills),"Direct and appealing with notes of dried herbs, cherry, and toast. It's broad in feel with good depth and structure with dry tannins the only thing holding it back."
US,91,58,Pinot Noir,red,Pali 2013 Sangiacomo Roberts Road Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Stemmy in earthy pine and clove-like spice, this is a powerfully dense and delicious wine. It's on the higher side in terms of alcohol, though doesn't reflect it in bouquet or taste. Savory dark berry wraps itself around mushroomy truffles and black tea to linger on the tongue through a lengthy, weighty finish."
US,91,50,Pinot Noir,red,JCB 2010 No. 7 Sonoma Collection Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a rich, delicious and balanced Pinot. It defines the modern California style, being dry, silky and ripe, showing a wealth of raspberry, cherry, cola, persimmon and spice flavors. Oak adds rich notes that are perfectly in keeping with the fruit. Drink this savory wine over the next few years."
Italy,86,25,Sangiovese,red,Brunelli Martoccia 2012  Rosso di Montalcino,"This simple wine has aromas that recall red berries, espresso and toast. The palate is on the lean side, displaying notes of clove, cinnamon and coffee bean. Pair it with hearty first courses, like pasta topped with ragù."
France,90,22,Riesling,white,Emile Beyer 2015 Tradition Riesling (Alsace),"Lifted chamomile joins riper pear and apple fruit on the nose of this wine. On the concentrated palate these are joined by lemon and grapefruit zest in an unapologetically bracing style. This wine is clean, dry, fresh and totally lip-smacking with the full force of citrus behind it."
France,90,40,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Brane-Cantenac 2007  Margaux,"Very modern and polished in style, this wine goes for the soft, juicy fruit characters. The tannins are sweet, equally soft, already delicious in character, finishing with smoky cranberry and black currant flavors."
Italy,91,45,Red Blend,red,Le Buche 2006 Giuseppe Olivi Tempore Red (Toscana),"This Tuscan blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon opens with an inky, dark appearance and beautifully intense aromas of ripe fruit, cassis, blackberry, spice and leather. It's velvety soft, with a long, plush finish."
US,94,45,Pinot Noir,red,Sean Thackrey 2010 Cassiopeia Wentzel Vineyard Clone 115 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Ethereally light with delicate red cherry flavor, this Pinot is soft, complex and interesting, with a racy herbal streak lurking in the background. Think a ham-and-cheese quiche gingerly sprinkled with thyme and oregano. So distinctive, one wonders what grows near this particular set of vines on the Wentzel Vineyard."
France,90,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Léon 2010 Prestige  (Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux),"A classically structured, stalky Bordeaux, with added superripe fruit. The result is a wine with firm, young tannins that merge with the juicy sweet black currant and intense fruitiness to finish. For medium-term aging."
US,91,58,Syrah,red,Sunstone 2005 Estate Bottled Reserve Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Stash this in the cellar for a while, because even though it's well over three years old, it's still a big, immature wine. Dry and tannic, it explodes with jammy blackberries, cherries, chocolate, cola, licorice, orange zest and pepper flavors, wrapped into sweet, smoky oak. The parts should begin to come together by the end of 2009."
US,92,35,Pinot Noir,red,MacMurray Ranch 2009 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Russian River-based MacMurray Ranch turns to the Central Coast's Santa Lucia Highlands for Pinot Noir, with admirable results. This is a terrific wine for drinking now, dry and powerful in red fruits, cola and spices, yet elegantly tailored. Might develop for a few years, but best now for youthful exuberance, although you do want to give it three hours in a decanter."
US,91,30,Chardonnay,white,Fritz 1998 Shop Block Vineyard Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A very distinctive Chard—full of character and even eccentricity. There are strong, up-front aromas of tangerines, vanilla, butterscotch, smoke, ripe peaches and caramel. It's especially notable for the thick, creamy texture and a penetrating, spicy clove note that follows through on the long, rich finish. A complex, serious wine."
US,88,42,Chardonnay,white,Buena Vista 2014 Jovita's Selection Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Reduced on the nose, this wine's petrol-like aromas dissipate as it opens, unveiling a sharp take on preserved lemon, Gravenstein apple and subtle oak flavors, its acidity reasonably sharp."
US,91,75,Merlot,red,Dunham 2008 Lewis Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Firm raspberry fruit, tight and concentrated, is swathed in a generous coat of deliciously toasty oak. Tart and youthful, the wine's depth comes through as it breathes open in the glass, adding licorice, coffee grounds, and buttered nuts to the toasty finish."
France,88,50,Pinot Noir,red,Manuel Olivier 2011  Aloxe-Corton,"This is a delicious, fruity wine with just a core of tannins to hold it together. It is packed with red berry fruits along with intense, still-youthful acidity. As it develops, it will become fruitier and softer."
US,85,10,Riesling,white,Paradise Peak 2012 Sweet Riesling (Washington),"A perfumed wine with notes of candied orange, peach and lavender. The palate is sweet and easy drinking. Chill down and enjoy."
US,93,55,Pinot Noir,red,Small Vines 2014 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This tiny, family-run production shows a tremendous talent at growing grapes and making wines of great substance and sophistication. It aims for a bright, restrained and complex style, which it achieves here with aplomb. Black cherry, mint and a tease of smoky oak accent a fleshy, lengthy texture and body that shines in acidity."
US,90,38,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hunt Cellars 2003 Bon Vivant Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Soft, smooth and elegant in texture, savory in flavor, this Central Coast Cab tastes of cherries, cassis, mocha and licorice. Smoky oak turns up on the finish. Forward enough to drink now, but it should hold for a couple of years."
France,90,37,Pinot Noir,red,Château de Santenay 2015 Les Champs Martin Premier Cru  (Mercurey),"Ripe tannins and rich red-plum fruits give this wine a generous rounded character. Bringing out the generosity of this vintage, the wine is a balance between the broad fruits and acidity. In the background, the tannins give the wine extra weight. Drink from 2019."
US,90,62,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Four Lanterns 2014 Third Blue Hour Cabernet Sauvignon (Templeton Gap District),"Fresh pressed blackberry and boysenberry scents meet wet clay and gravel on the nose of this bottling from one of Paso Robles' cooler corners. Vibrant acidity shows on the palate, with light tannins that frame its plump berry and graphite flavors."
US,88,20,Pinot Gris,white,Yamhill Valley 2015 Pinot Gris (McMinnville),"This brings a lively mix of green citrus and green banana, with a light streak of white peach. All in all, it's balanced and fresh, though it falls on the lighter side, despite the generous finished alcohol."
France,90,55,Chardonnay,white,Bouchard Père & Fils 2011 Les Clous  (Meursault),"From a parcel of vines in the Meursault village appellation, this attractive, soft wine has ripe grapefruit and pear flavors to go with the crisp acidity and the lightest touch of wood. Drink from 2015."
Italy,89,300,Syrah,red,Tua Rita 2011 Per Sempre Syrah (Toscana),"Mature black fruit, spice, underbrush and tobacco aromas lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The round, robust palate delivers spicy plum, blackberry, ground black pepper and licorice alongside big but velvety tannins. The heat of alcohol is evident."
US,87,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,J. Lohr 2005 Hilltop Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"More like the 2000 than the richer '97 or '99, J. Lohr's 2005 Hilltop Cab is very fruity, but a little too soft. The cherry, currant, chocolate, anise and spicy plum flavors have a melted quality. Drink soon."
Italy,88,21,Chardonnay,white,Isidoro Polencic 2014 Chardonnay (Collio),"Vibrant and elegant, this opens with scents of citrus blossom, Golden Delicious apple and a whiff of herb. The bright palate offers tangerine zest, mineral hint of almond alongside bright acidity."
US,86,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Howell Mountain Vineyards 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Soft and sweet for a Howell Mountain Cabernet, with one-dimensional red currant, mocha, cola and new oak flavors. Hard to see it going anywhere, so drink up."
US,83,42,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,V. Sattui 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a dull, hugely tannic wine. It's hard to penetrate, with its robust use of dry oak and heat. The finish delivers a shot of gunpowder and graphite."
France,91,40,Chardonnay,white,Château de Maligny 2010 Fourchaume Premier Cru  (Chablis),"Round and rich, this has streaks of lemon and orange zest that cut through the vanilla and creamed apple texture. A note of spice makes the wine complex and rich. This is worth aging for several years."
US,87,13,Riesling,white,Highland Cellars 2007 Oughterson Family Estates Riesling (Seneca Lake),"This late-release Riesling from Seneca Lake wafts with the delicate perfume of sweet peas, ripe stonefruits and a petrol undertone. Dry, but with a touch of white peach sweetness, refreshing lime juice flavors and a high toned acidity keep this wine refreshing and brisk."
US,91,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Punch 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Much of the fruit for this wine comes from Napa's Mount Veeder, with additions from neighboring Sonoma County and other unidentified statewide sources. Even so, this shows a Napa-esque flair, bearing softly ripe blackberry and cassis flavors, with balance and richness. The winemakers and owners are the husband and wife team from Mount Veeder's Lagier-Meredith."
US,85,30,Syrah,red,Bourassa Vineyards 2005 Rhapsody 3 Syrah (Napa Valley),"Similar to past bottlings, Bourassa's 2005 Syrah is slightly rustic. It has a baked-fruit quality of blackberry and black cherry pie filling, and is very peppery. Given the right fare, such as a pepper steak, it could work some magic."
Italy,90,35,Red Blend,red,Rocca di Frassinello 2009 Le Sughere di Frassinello  (Maremma),"Le Sughere di Frassinello represents a blend of Sangiovese (50%), Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The 2009 shows a dark, inky color and alluring aromas of savory spice, mature fruit, plum, cherry and moist pipe tobacco. There's loads of heft and concentration in the mouth followed by a decadent, velvety finish."
Italy,90,80,Sangiovese,red,Ruffino 2010 Greppone Mazzi  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Pretty aromas of red berry, menthol, savory herb and cooking spice lead the nose. The palate offers tart red cherry, white pepper and Mediterranean herb alongside firm, refined tannins and bright acidity. It needs time to develop fully. Drink 2017–2022."
US,84,38,Zinfandel,red,Turley 2010 Dogtown Vineyard Zinfandel (Lodi),"This is a sound example of the warm-climate style of Zinfandel. It's high alcohol gives it a hot, chili-pepper-like sting, and the blackberry fruit has a Port-like, raisiny edge."
US,87,22,Chardonnay,white,Three Rivers 1999 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is very appealing when first popped, with plenty of forward  butter and caramel scents livening up the fresh fruit. Ready to drink right now, it retains enough acid to stand up to food, though the finish is a little bitter from all the new oak."
US,92,125,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Blackbird Vineyards 2011 Contrarian Red (Napa Valley),"Sweet cherry, red licorice, violet, cocoa and new oak flavors make this wine drinkable now despite firm tannins. Cabernet Sauvignon's role is relatively muted, with Cab Franc taking a starring role, and Merlot also a strong component of the blend. The window of drinkability extends at least through 2019."
US,90,48,Chardonnay,white,Talley 2013 Rosemary's Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Light in aromas, this wine shows light honeydew, gray slate, wet cement and a hint of butter crisps on the nose. The palate is also delicate, with lime juice that arises on the midpalate and lasts through the finish. Citrus-blossom elements add to the bright, light and tight flavors."
US,89,36,Pinot Noir,red,Sarah's Vineyard 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Earthy aromas of potting soil and tomato leaf give nuance to the rose petal and pomegranate fruit that show on the nose of this bottling. It's light and lively on the palate, with cranberries barely showing through the dried sage, oregano, bay leaf and thyme herbs."
US,86,30,Red Blend,red,IL Gioiello 2007 Triumphe Red (Amador County),"Sharp in acids and a little green, this dry red wine tastes like an old-fashioned Chianti. The flavors are of red cherries, herbs and pepper. Made from 70% Sangiovese and Cabernet Franc."
US,85,14,Red Blend,red,Mission Hardware 2007 Winemaker's Select Old Sonoma Red (Sonoma Valley),"This Merlot-Zinfandel blend is very dry, full-bodied and rustic, with blackberry, currant, herb and cedar flavors that have bitter tobacco notes on the finish. Good with everyday fare."
US,87,13,Syrah,red,Sterling 2009 Vintner's Collection Syrah (Central Coast),"There's a lot to like in this affordable Syrah. It's rich and smoky, with blackberry and bacon flavors wrapped in a smooth texture. With 17,000 cases produced, this should be relatively easy to find."
US,85,13,Red Blend,red,Chime NV Schatz Family Vineyard Red (California),"Easygoing and soft in texture, this medium-bodied red wine has fruity, jammy aromas and flavors, and blends in a little black pepper for interest."
US,86,25,Chardonnay,white,Rutherford Hill 2013 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Intensely generous in toffee and buttered caramel, this wine veers into a perception of sweetness, held up by a thick presence of oak. Medium bodied, it tastes heavier than expected."
France,94,60,Pinot Noir,red,Seguin-Manuel 2015 Champs Pimont Premier Cru  (Beaune),"This is a rich wine with great potential. Its juicy spice and acidity are balanced with the red fruits, the generous texture and the fine structure. It is a wine that sums up the ripeness of the vintage. Drink from 2024."
France,90,86,Chardonnay,white,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2015  Puligny-Montrachet,"This wine, while rich, has all the minerality and crisp texture associated with the appellation. Wood aging adds spice. It needs some aging, not much, and will be ready to drink from 2019."
US,88,15,Riesling,white,North by Northwest 2014 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas of lime leaf and citrus lead to sleek, dry fruit flavors, speckled with lime notes on the finish. Pair it with shrimp ceviche."
US,83,40,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,A.S. Kiken 2005 Red Table Wine Red (Diamond Mountain District),"This is sort of a second wine from Reverie. It's rustic and sharp, with tart, jellied blackberry and cherry flavors. Not going anywhere."
US,88,20,Zinfandel,red,Clos du Lac 2004 Reserve Blend Zinfandel (Sierra Foothills),"A few words that describe this wine are lusty, brawny, rustic, really ripe, jammy, peppery, smooth and spicy. In other words, classic Foothills Zin. But just as important is what it's not. It's not high in alcohol, nor is it sweet. Drink this balanced Zin with barbecued ribs."
US,90,40,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Amici 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Spring Mountain District),"Aged half in stainless and half in new French oak for eight months, this is a complex, tangy wine with medium viscosity and a strong taste of lemon peel and green apple. With a slightly tropical edge of lemongrass, it's lively and fresh."
US,82,29,Chardonnay,white,Keenan 2006 Chardonnay (Spring Mountain District),"From the fine Spring Mountain appellation, this has sweet-and-sour flavors of apricots, pineapples and brown sugar."
Italy,87,26,Sangiovese,red,Badia a Coltibuono 2006  Chianti Classico,"You can tell by its thin but still very vibrant color that this is a traditional Chianti Classico (90/10 Sangiovese–Canaiolo) that puts emphasis on delicacy and balance, not on thick concentration. It is that quality that makes this wine well-suited to most Italian and Mediterranean dishes."
Italy,86,37,Red Blend,red,Scilio 2005 Sikélios Red (Sicilia),"This is a distinctive dessert wine that opens with an inky, dark ruby color and savory aromas of root beer, button mushroom, sun-dried fruit, prune and figs. The wine's sweet finish is dense and sticky."
US,86,13,Chardonnay,white,Lamoreaux Landing 2011 Estate Bottled Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Touches of vanilla, spice and smoked nuts lend complexity to straightforward apple, lemon and pear flavors in this dry, medium-bodied Chardonnay. It's refreshing and easy drinking with a brisk, clean finish."
US,92,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Canvasback 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"Coming from a warm vintage in a hot region, this wine brings light aromas of mineral and red and black fruit along with a barrel-spice top note. The black-cherry flavors are lush, full and palate coating, supported by firm tannins. It's high on the delicious scale."
US,86,22,Pinot Noir,red,Stephen Ross 2006 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"A very nice Pinot. You might call it well-behaved. It's clean, dry and crisp, showing good coastal character in the acid-brightened cherry and pomegranate flavors that are enriched with a little smoky oak."
US,88,15,Red Blend,red,Kamiak 2014 Palouse River Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A pretty pale-salmon color, this blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon has aromas and flavors of cherry, watermelon and spice. It drinks dry, with the fruit flavors bringing a textured, fleshy feel."
US,90,32,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Alexandria Nicole 2009 Alderdale Destiny Ridge Vineyards Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"Beautifully structured, this fruit-laden Cabernet shows a rich core of sweet blackberry, cherry and cassis notes that are dappled with pretty baking spices. The tannins are smooth and supple; the finish is clean and inviting."
US,90,24,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Bianchi 2006 Lakeside Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"A very nice Cab made in the Paso style. It's soft, dry and spicy, a round, supple wine with flavors of black currants, raspberries and cedar. Attractive and classy."
US,85,12,Pinot Gris,white,Kings Ridge 2008 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"A little sweaty in the nose, this moves ahead with pineapple and grapefruit flavors, finishing with slightly bitter citrus rind flavors. It's more of a food wine than a sipping wine."
US,88,55,Pinot Noir,red,Acacia 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This is a thickly concentrated and powerfully full-bodied wine, spicy in clove and cinnamon as well as a lingering note of cola. The fruit leans into blackberry and black cherry, with a pronounced weedy, herbal undertone."
US,87,22,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Lava Cap 2009 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (El Dorado),"A very soft-textured Cab, unusual for its high-elevation origins, with sweet red fruit and dark plum nestled around a trace of chocolate."
France,91,39,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Beauséjour 2010  Puisseguin Saint-Émilion,"With the high alcohol typical of 2010 vintage, this is a ripe, jammy and full wine. Black plums ooze richness against a background of firm tannins and acidity that will allow the wine to age. It is dense, concentrated and powerful, needing some time. Drink from 2018."
US,88,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,J. Christopher 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Willamette Valley),"This clean, fresh, bracingly grassy wine makes you wish there were more Sauv Blancs from the Willamette Valley. It has the crisp elegance of the Loire, along with a delicate suggestion of chalk."
US,90,48,Pinot Noir,red,Terra Valentine 2011 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is quite an interesting Pinot Noir. With a scent of mushrooms, cola and cherry pie and good acidity, it's Burgundian, with a pale color and a light, silky body. The alcohol is relatively high, but the wine wears it well. Although it's drinking well now, the wine should get a little better over the next 4–6 years."
US,88,29,Zinfandel,red,Beaver Creek 2008 Zinfandel (Lake County),"Beaver Creek's Lake County Zin is juicy and spicy, full of stewy red fruit and rough-hewn tannins that are thick and fragrant of oak and molasses. Definitely big though well made for its style. Time and air are its friends."
US,85,25,Syrah,red,Rusack 2011 Ballard Canyon Estate Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Tasty but ultimately simple, with raspberry and cherry jam, orange rind and plenty of sweet, toasty oak flavors. Drink up."
US,82,42,Syrah,red,"Donkey & Goat 2012 Broken Leg Vineyard, The Recluse Syrah (Anderson Valley)","The sweet aromas of this wine are like boysenberry syrup, but flavors are very lean, dry, smoky and tart. The texture coats the palate with puckering tannins."
US,88,30,Chardonnay,white,Truchard 2012 Chardonnay (Carneros),"Dry, oaky and minerally, this Chardonnay shows intensely focused Meyer lemon, lime, Asian pear and golden apricot flavors, whose acidity makes it savory.

Italy,88,15,Sangiovese,red,Rocca di Montemassi 2011 Le Focaie  (Maremma Toscana),"Impressive work is quietly being performed at Rocca di Montemassi, the Zonin-owned property in southern Tuscany.

It offers brooding aromas of herbs, dried cherry, licorice and green tea, while the flavors are restrained with cranberry-like tartness and grainy tannins."
US,89,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Savage Grace 2012 Red Willow Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Yakima Valley),"Several different clones are blended into this Loire-influenced Sauvignon Blanc. The freshness and tart, tangy citrus fruit flavors are impressive, and would certainly match well to a plate of raw oysters."
Italy,94,20,Red Blend,red,Le Fraghe 2015 Brol Grande  (Bardolino),"Showing Bardolino's more serious side, this delicious red opens on aromas of wild berry, pressed blue flower, spice and a balsamic note. With a blend of Corvina and Rondinella, the elegant, well-structured palate delivers morello cherry, black pepper and clove. Refined tannins provide the polished framework. Drink through 2019."
US,89,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hightower 2012 Murray Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The blend includes roughly equal amounts of Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec, nicely integrated. The structure and palate weight seem more mainstream Yakima Valley than Red Mountain, lending extra balance and herbal detail to the wine."
US,89,28,Pinot Noir,red,David Hill 2006 Barrel Select Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"David Hill's 2006 Pinot Noirs are a clear step up from earlier vintages. This Barrel Select bottling, done in a fairly light, rather delicate style, offers lovely texture and balance, with ripe flavors of strawberry, brandied cherries and baker's chocolate. Suggestions of earth and iron filings add interest and weight to the finish."
France,88,14,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Laulerie 2012 Elevé en Fûts de Chêne Red (Bergerac),"The wood aging still shows in this wine, although not too aggressively. It also has layers of spice, acidity and plenty of red berry fruits. Let it soften and drink from 2017."

US,91,55,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Two Vintners 2014 Sal May's Discovery Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"The aromas are brooding, with notes of wood spice, incense, black fruit and graphite. The palate brings bold blackberry flavors backed by firm tannins. It needs time to unwind. Best after 2020."
France,87,13,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Mas Carlot 2013 Red (Costières de Nîmes),"This medium-weight wine is a blend of 50% Grenache, 40% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre, and the resulting wine admirably reflects elements of each variety. Treebark notes on the nose from the Mourvèdre, boysenberries from the Grenache and black olives from the Syrah. With its mild tannins, it's drinkable now through 2020."
France,88,70,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Laborde 2009 Cuvée 1628  (Lalande de Pomerol),"This rich, full-bodied wine is becoming smooth and ripe. The tannins are enveloped by the generous black fruits and drier raisins. A core of dryness show the wine is still developing. Drink from 2015."
US,87,30,Chardonnay,white,Fernwood 2006 Estate Vanumanutagi Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Crisp and flavorful, a delicious Chardonnay designed for rich fare like scallops or shrimp in saffron, coconut milk and butter sauce.

France,87,20,Chardonnay,white,Simonnet-Febvre 2014 Quintessence de Lyre,"Named after the Lyre style of vine training, this wine comes from the far north of Burgundy, close to Chablis. It is soft, smooth and creamy, with a light minerality and perfumed acidity. It is just right to drink now."
US,92,70,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Robert Craig 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"A lovely and complex Cabernet from this mountain in the southerly Mayacamas chain. It shows the big, firm tannins of its origins, with a dry sturdiness backing up the intense black currant flavors. Drinkable now for sheer decadence, although it also seems to have the stuffing to age for a decade."
France,89,40,Chardonnay,white,Château de Santenay 2014 Le Roc Blanc  (Mercurey),"Layers of wood aging give this wine its initial spicy character. The flavors broaden out to bring in the ripe citrus and yellow fruits that are already well developed. With its edge of minerality, the wine still has room to age. Drink from 2017."
US,85,32,Chardonnay,white,Athair 2007 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A sound, good Chardonnay that offers popular flavors made in the modern way. The wine is soft and dry, with ripe notes of pineapples, pears, buttered toast and butterscotch."
US,87,12,Chardonnay,white,Greystone 2010 Chardonnay (California),"Acidic and citrusy, this Chard could almost be a Pinot Grigio. The tartness really gets the mouth watering, and the flavors suggest tangerines, grapefruits and limes. Savory and clean."

US,91,18,Pinot Noir,red,Thirsty Owl Wine Company 2015 Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),"Lavish violet perfume introduces this demure yet luminous Pinot Noir. Crisp black cherry and berry flavors are full of tartness and vibe, yet edged by soft tones of toast and earth, along with a fine frame of tannins. The finish meanders beautifully. It's ready to drink now but should continue to drink well until at least 2023."
France,85,6,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Seguin 2015 Sauvignon de Seguin  (Bordeaux Blanc),"Bruno Mottet's 2013 purchase of Right Bank Château Seguin now delivers a ripe, smooth and soft wine.

US,89,45,Syrah,red,Sinor-LaVallee 2013 White Label Bassi VIneyard Syrah (San Luis Obispo County),"Mike Sinor's lighter take on Syrah from his new coastal vineyard is refreshing though not quite as inviting as the Black Label. Black cherry, white sage and spearmint notes entice the nose, before the palate breathes in tart elderberries and black pepper, presented with tight tannins and brisk acidity."
US,93,72,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Macauley 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Although it's soft, it shows enough structure to support exceptionally ripe blackberry, black currant and spice flavors, with richness added by a heady note of liqueur. The tannins are substantial, and the wine is already throwing some sediment. Very nice now, and it should develop bottle nuance over the next 6–8 years."
France,83,12,Chardonnay,white,Tussock Jumper 2016 Chardonnay (Vin de France),This light-bodied wine shows citrus and green fruit touches. It has a soft aftertaste that makes it attractive and ready to drink.
France,94,39,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Daniel Chotard 2015 Les Cris  (Sancerre),"This is a limited production wine from small parcels of limestone soil. Aged in acacia barrels, it has subtle spice and toast flavors. They wood aging has had the effect of broadening the wine and giving it extra richness. It's an impressive wine, ready to drink from 2018."

Italy,87,16,Red Blend,red,Maggiovini 2007 Amongae Red (Sicilia),"An easy blend of oak-aged Nero d'Avola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, Amongae represents a new, modern side of Sicilian winemaking. There are plush fruit aromas here, enhanced by tobacco, cigar box and drying mineral nuances."
US,88,45,Pinot Noir,red,Churchill Cellars 2008 Two Vineyard Blend Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Churchill makes Pinots in a lighter-bodied style, but they're still elegant and complex. This translucent wine is silky in the mouth, and the raspberry, cherry, and cola flavors are enhanced with brisk acidity. Best Now–2014."
US,92,55,Pinot Noir,red,Dutton-Goldfield 1999 Freestone Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Only 120 cases of this wine from the Sonoma Coast, where cool weather limits ripeness. There are Burgundian aromas of grilled meat, raw meat and mushroom, with dark berries. Very dry, but with a glyceriney sweetness, it's light and supple on the palate. Might age; might not. This is still unexplored territory for Pinot Noir."
France,89,23,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Kirkland Signature 2014  Pauillac,This is a new wine in this ever-expanding series. It reflects the structure and solid tannins of the appellation.

US,84,21,Zinfandel,red,Murphy-Goode 2007 Liar's Dice Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"This young, fresh, fruity Zin tastes like raspberry and cherry jam and bubblegum. It's an effusively easy wine, and very dry and soft. Okay with everyday fare like ham or a juicy cheeseburger."
US,84,26,Riesling,white,City Winery Chicago 2013 Across The Pond Riesling (Old Mission Peninsula),Mild aromas of citrus cream and sea spray mark the nose. Broader stone fruit flavors give weight to the palate that doesn't seem to quite balance out by the sugary finish.
US,84,10,Pinot Grigio,white,Discoveries 2010 Pinot Grigio (California),"For the price this is a nice party wine. It's sweet, offering ripe citrus and vanilla flavors. Production was 5,400 cases."
France,90,38,Chardonnay,white,Alex Gambal 2014  Fixin,"From a small vineyard in the north of the Côte de Nuits, this is a rare white wine in a red-wine region. Lightly toasty, it has spice, pear flavors and perfumed acidity. It's bright and crisp, ending with lively acidity."
US,91,41,Merlot,red,Northstar 2010 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"True to the vintage, this is a more aromatically brooding wine than often found from this winery, with notes of dark raspberries, vanilla and assorted barrel spices. It's full bodied, layered and rich with cherry and raspberry flavors showing a lot of depth and intensity. Best after 2017."
US,87,25,Merlot,red,Fidelitas 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Even in his less-expensive wines, such as this Columbia Valley Merlot, winemaker Charlie Hoppes gets excellent color extraction. Along with the color come stiff, substantial tannins; once in the mouth, however, the wine sets a different course, turning rather light and fruity. Tart cherry and wild berry flavors quickly give way to thick tannins and barrel flavors of baking chocolate."
US,86,26,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Cloudlift Cellars 2011 Panorama Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"A blend of 57% Merlot, 26% Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc all come from Alder Ridge Vineyard, shows notes of milk chocolate, cherry, herbs and tire rubber.

US,84,18,Riesling,white,Pyrenees 2011 Riesling (Umpqua Valley),"This is single vineyard Riesling with notes of apple cider, spice and lees. It offsets 2.8% Residual Sugar with tart, electric acidity but doesn't quite have the depth of flavors to match."
US,87,125,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,AuburnJames 2009 Bella Vista Vineyard Block 1 and 4 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This mature block-designated wine shows round blackberry flavors offset by leather and smoke. Full bodied, it's densely built and powerfully ripe."
US,88,20,Pinot Noir,red,Chime 2014 North Coast Pinot Noir (North Coast),"A mix of just-ripe fruit flavors and savory accents on a medium-bodied frame make this wine intriguing to taste. It starts with seemingly sweet fruity aromas, but then the flavors turn a bit leaner and more complex."
US,89,49,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Mari 2010 Row 7 Red (Old Mission Peninsula),"Grown in the winery's Nellaserra greenhouse vineyards, this Cabernet Franc and Merlot blend achieves warmer climate ripeness in one of Michigan's northern AVAs.

Italy,87,22,Pinot Grigio,white,Comelli 2006 Amplius Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"Although Pinot Grigios are white wines, you could consider this a rosé instead because of its luminous copper color.

Italy,91,90,Sangiovese,red,Corte Pavone 2010  Brunello di Montalcino,"Made with organically farmed grapes, this opens with pretty aromas of crushed rose, violet, perfumed berry, leather, truffle and a balsamic note. The warm palate doles out fleshy wild cherry, stewed plum, cake spice, anisette and savory herb alongside velvety tannins. It closes on a licorice note and the heat of evident alcohol. Drink 2018–2025."
US,88,35,Chardonnay,white,Joullian 2013 Highland Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This wine shows more age than it should, but is quite good now, with aromas of vanilla, honeysuckle, molasses, white-flower extract and liquid marshmallow ice-cream topping. The palate brings apple extract and roasted nut flavors."
France,85,31,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Suau 2009 500 ml  (Cadillac),"Billed as a dessert wine, this is in fact more of an apéritif wine, with its botrytis sweetness muted by a soft, open character. It has ripe apricot flavors, hints of honey and a tang of orange peel."
US,90,45,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Dragonette 2013 Grassini Family Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"Distinctive elements on the nose of this wine from the Buellton-based winery include dried peach, lemon ice and a touch of yogurt and sour cream.

US,89,36,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Bartholomew Park 1997 Alta Vista Vyds Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"An unmistakable meatiness marks the nose, and then there's some Middle Eastern spices like cumin and coriander. Earthy and full of black-fruit flavor, with oak pouring in late. Try to ignore the bulky young tannins; assume the wine will mature and find its stride down the road."
France,95,70,Riesling,white,Cave de Turckheim 2015 Brand Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"What a heady nose. Tangerine peel, hay flowers and ripe apples all dance and swirl across the senses. The palate takes the swirling fruit and fragrance up a notch, heightened with the intensity of tangy lemon freshness. This has utter precision and concentration, there almost seems to be a life force of stone and power behind it. It's a textbook Riesling with a clean, dry and totally tangy moreish finish. Lovely now but with great potential. Drink 2017–2035."
France,85,13,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château La Mothe du Barry 2015 French Kiss Red (Bordeaux Clairet),Red-plum and strawberry fruits are combined with a firm structure in this ripe wine. It has attractive acidity to give enough freshness. Drink from late 2016.
France,90,16,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Bernadotte 2012  Haut-Médoc,"With the same winemaking team as Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande in Pauillac, Bernadotte has a good pedigree.

US,88,32,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Maisonry 2012 Hudson Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"The vineyard is in the Carneros district, which makes you wonder why the winery doesn't so identify it.

France,92,55,Chardonnay,white,Louis Latour 1998 Les Referts Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),"A rich, lush melange of fruit and nuts, with sinuous, almost unctuous flavors that twine around the palate like a snake. Long, fascinating finish, elegantly balanced and precise."
US,88,26,Pinot Noir,red,Phelps Creek 2006 Becky's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"This blend of grapes from three different Columbia Gorge vineyards is immediately appealing, with round, smoky, relatively soft and accessible flavors.

US,92,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Rodney Strong 2009 Alexander's Crown Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"This is the winery's top Cabernet. The '09 is very ripe, rich and forward, offering powerful blackberry, cherry and currant flavors that are wrapped into soft, gentle tannins.

US,88,30,Merlot,red,Madrigal 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Here's a dry, stylish Merlot that will take a supporting role on the table, rather than trying to dominate it. It's fairly tannic but well-structured, with subtle flavors of dried cherries, red currants, pepper and violets. Drink now."

The juicy palate delivers mature wild cherry layered with white pepper, cinnamon, thyme and mint.

US,90,12,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Sand Point 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Lodi),"This sophisticated and beautifully balanced wine shows that Lodi can make crisp and poised whites. It has aromas like white pepper and dried thyme, crisp lemon flavors and racy acidity. It is nicely dry, clean and tautly refreshing. While medium bodied, it has a big, vibrant presence."
US,86,30,Chardonnay,white,Mercy 2009 Zabala Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),"Showing oaky flavors of vanilla, butterscotch and buttered toast, this Chardonnay has the brisk acidity of the Arroyo Seco appellation. The flavors are of pineapples, oranges and limes."
US,90,22,Zinfandel,red,Folie à Deux 1998 D'Agostini Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (Amador County),"Full, textured nose mixes cherries and herbs, very clean and complex. The vines are almost 80 years old, and yield a briary, wild berry quality to the fruit. Balanced and complex wine, which unfolds in lingering layers through a long, satisfying finish."
France,86,25,Pinot Noir,red,Château de Santenay 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne),"Sourced from grapes grown in the Côte Chalonnaise, this is a soft, red-fruit-flavored wine, with a ripe, jammy character that makes it almost sweet. It is ready to drink."
US,86,15,Zinfandel,red,Rancho Zabaco 2011 Sonoma Heritage Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Even after an hour of airing, this wine is tart and sweet in primary blackberry, boysenberry and cherry fruit, which gives it a rustic, jammy taste. The sweetness suggests drinking this wine with rich meats slathered in sugary barbecue sauce."
US,91,36,Pinot Noir,red,Mansfield-Dunne 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Very light in the glass, this wine shows strawberry, wild thyme, charred cedar and a smoke character. It's dainty and very herbal on the sip, with cranberry and pomegranate flavors enhanced by dried oregano and bay leaf."
US,84,25,Red Blend,red,Black Box 2013 Red Elegance Red (California),"Ripe tomato, prune and herb flavors come with some sweetness and a soft, full texture. Still, it has enough tannin and acidity to keep it lively on the finish."
US,83,11,Merlot,red,Beaulieu Vineyard 2010 Coastal Estates Merlot (California),"Dry, acidic and tannic, this has cherry and spice flavors. It's reminiscent of an old-fashioned Chianti."
France,89,24,Pinot Gris,white,Rieflé 2011 Côte de Rouffach Pinot Gris (Alsace),"This rich, boldy alcoholic wine has a pepper character that dominates fragrant fruit and spice notes. It should age well, so drink until 2020."
France,91,60,Chardonnay,white,Bouchard Père & Fils 2011 Clos Saint-Landry Premier Cru  (Beaune),"This was the first vineyard bought by the Bouchard family, purchased in 1791. More than 220 years later, this 2011 has a delicate touch of wood nestled in the heart of creamy fruit flavors. Crisp lemon and tight acidity give a bright, fresh aftertaste. Drink from 2016."
US,87,19,Red Blend,red,Midnight 2013 Full Moon Red (Paso Robles),"This everyday drinker leads with concentrated but mellow aromas of black plum, turned earth, anise and sweet mint. It's quite full on the palate, with baked red fruit and baking spice flavors. Very fruit-forward."
US,88,22,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Clos La Chance 2011 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Central Coast),"This brisk and refreshing wine never saw a splinter of oak, so what stars are the pure, ripe flavors of tropical and citrus fruits, lemongrass, honey and a hint of white pepper. The acidity gives it a keen, clean finish. This would be great with everything from roast chicken to Vietnamese food."
US,91,90,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Stags' Leap Winery 2013 The Leap Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"Lushly rich on both the nose and the palate, this wine from the heart of the appellation is etched in chocolate and cedar, showing a ying-yang pull between savory and sweet. Currant and dried herb season chalky, firm tannin and toasted oak."
US,91,45,Pinot Noir,red,Byron 2010 Whole Cluster Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"The stems that were included in the fermentation give this wine a full-bodied, tannic mouthfeel, as well as adding to the spices. With raspberry, cherry and mocha flavors, it's a powerful Pinot that wants two or three years in the cellar."
Italy,90,26,Red Blend,red,Volpaia 2011  Chianti Classico,"Violet, iris, red berry and spice scents take center stage in this delicious blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot and Syrah. The bright, fruity palate delivers wild cherry, black pepper and cinnamon spice notes alongside assertive tannins and freshness."
US,89,10,Pinot Grigio,white,Geyser Peak 2012 Pinot Grigio (California),"Dry, crisp and clean, this has rich flavors of citrus, honeydew, green apple and vanilla, brightened with keen acidity. This should be relatively easy to find."
US,91,85,Pinot Noir,red,Hirsch 2014 West Ridge Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Lean and dry on the palate, this medium-bodied wine has a subtle concentration of red-fruit flavors and fine layers of mineral and spice that unfold on the palate. Grown on a pioneering property along the Sonoma Cost, it will be best after 2020."
US,91,40,Pinot Noir,red,Renteria 2010 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Ripe, succulent flavors of cherries and cola mark this Pinot, along with earthier complexities of grilled mushrooms. Oak adds a sweet layer of toast, yet the wine remains satisfyingly dry. It's so delicious now, you can hardly keep from drinking it, but it will reward a year or two in the cellar."
US,87,27,Chardonnay,white,Twill 2014 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Ripe apple and banana flavors lead this native yeast-fermented, oak-aged wine. Its loose-knit mix of fruit seems on the cusp of oxidation and is countered with tart, lemony acidity."
US,90,28,Syrah,red,Transcendence 2009 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"This is high in alcohol, but it will easily pair with barbecue. It's made from fruit grown in the warm Larner Vineyard in Santa Ynez Valley as well as from the cool Lafond Vineyard in Santa Rita Hills. Rich, dry and complex, it offers brisk, citrusy acidity to offset the ripe blackberry, currant and sandalwood flavors."
US,84,24,Riesling,white,Coquelicot 2008 Riesling (Santa Ynez Valley),"A little clumsy in the mouth, with some green flavors alongside the apricot, citrus and slate flavors. Seems a bit off-dry, although high acidity provides balance. The final impression is of a rustic and everyday quaff."
France,85,7,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Taussin 2014 Premium  (Bordeaux),"Although obviously still young, this fruity wine will develop fast. It benefits from the ripe fruit of the vintage, sweet black currants and berries that are given a crisp edge by the acidity. Already balanced, it will be drinkable from 2016."
US,83,7,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Monterey Vineyard 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon (Monterey County),"Starts out with rough, earthy blackberry and cassis aromas, with deeper notes of plum and chocolate. Drinks very soft and velvety, almost too much so; seems to lack acidity and vibrancy. At this price, though, you can’t expect miracles."
France,89,29,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine Pellé 2014 La Croix au Garde  (Sancerre),"Although best known for its base in Menetou-Salon, Pellé also has 12 acres of vines in Sancerre. This wine is fresh and crisp, with a strongly herbal element that gives a textured character as well as tight acidity. It is ready to drink."
France,96,281,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Jean Grivot 2013  Clos de Vougeot,"This offers a firm, dense structure, with dark tannins and big, ripe, opulent fruits. At the same time the elegance that is the hallmark of the domaine is equally present with stylish red fruits and a velvet texture. The wine needs to age to be at its peak, although it is beautiful now. Drink from 2020."
France,86,17,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Noblet 2012  Côtes de Bourg,The young tannins are keeping the wine dry at the moment. But the flavors of black currant fruitiness and fresh acidity promise a bright and fruity future. Drink from 2016.
US,86,25,Merlot,red,Raphael 2001 Estate Bottled Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"Several years of aging has brought out some nice leather and barnyard tones that blend well with the raspberry and cherry fruit. Pleasant vanilla notes grace the moderately long and gripping finish. Although it was quite pretty when first opened, this wine declines in the glass and should therefore be drunk up as soon as possible. Try with smoked meats."
US,85,10,Red Blend,red,Snoqualmie 2007 Whistle Stop Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Herbal and dill infuse the light flavors, and the tannins feel as if they've been softened up in the winemaking process. The wine does a quick fade."
US,88,40,Syrah,red,:Nota Bene 2011 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain),"This 100% varietal wine offers aromas of barrel spices, mint, dried fruit and barnyard. It's full bodied but still shows good deftness."
US,88,28,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Round Pond 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),"Pear and vanilla ride a wave capped by ripe tropical flourish in this thick and richly layered white from the heart of the appellation. Stainless-steel fermented, it exudes succulence and a strong taste of canned peach."
US,93,175,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Pine Ridge 2013 Fortis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A top-of-the-line effort and a departure from the producer's single-vineyard, 100% varietal bottlings, this blends 4% Malbec and 3% Merlot. Spicy with clove scents, it showcases deep cassis and cranberry flavors, with a lift of red fruit and supportive acidity."
US,85,15,White Blend,white,Annefield Vineyards NV White (Virginia),"Aromas of white currant and green pear are combined with accents of pine and citrus blossom in this blend of Vidal Blanc, Traminette, Viognier and Petite Manseng. The medium-bodied palate tastes off-dry (50g/L residual sugar), and the acidity feels tempered by the sweetness. It finishes with a tropical fruit flavor, a tang of minerality and energy."
US,89,18,Syrah,red,Klinker Brick 2007 Farráh Syrah (Lodi),"There are delicious flavors in this ripe Syrah, and while it's too soft for comfort, it sure is nice to drink. Offers waves of blackberries, mocha, black pepper and smoky sandalwood that finish thoroughly dry and complex in Asian spices."
France,84,22,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Haut Millet 2014  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,This Alliance Bourg wine is dry and firm with its concentrated tannins. Too much extraction has left a bitter character. It will remain a wine that is tough.
US,85,15,Pinot Noir,red,Noble Vines 2012 667 Pinot Noir (Monterey County),"For $15 or less, you can't expect a great Pinot Noir, but you can expect a good everyday one, which is what this is. It's dry, silky and smooth, with cherry pie and white pepper flavors."
Italy,90,25,Red Blend,red,Tenuta Moraia 2010 Pietracupa  (Bolgheri),"This blend of 70% Cabernet and 30% Merlot shows pristine, lively accents of cherry, blackberry and prune. Spicy leather and tobacco tones bring up the rear, which give the palate extra girth and density."
US,85,25,Red Blend,red,Shalestone 2007 Synergy Red (Finger Lakes),"Rich and ripe on the nose with dark black fruit and olives, this is an easygoing blend of Syrah, Cab and Merlot. Medium-bodied in style, it's soft on the palate with plush tannins and flavors of cooked plum compote accented by darker hints of olive and sage."
US,93,50,Pinot Noir,red,Erath 2009 Leland Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Ripe, full-bodied black cherry fruit shines here, with good tannin support. The wine is rich across the palate, with clean, focused, lingering flavors that really extend into a terrifically long finish."
US,82,18,Chardonnay,white,Rued 2010 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"So sweet. With sugary tangerine and pineapple flavors and plenty of caramel, it quickly palls."
US,94,45,Pinot Noir,red,Élevée Winegrowers 2012 Élevée Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"The lovely label does not deceive—this is a quality product from package to palate. It's expressively aromatic, as Pinot should be, with rose petals, orange peel, raspberries and cherries. That clean, pure fruit gains weight as it carries into a lingering finish, streaked with white chocolate and supported with perfect acidity."
US,92,45,Syrah,red,K Vintners 2013 River Rock Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Somewhat locked up at present, the aromas offer notes of brown stems, crushed flowers, dried earth and green olive, with the fruit lurking in the background. The palate mixes savory and red-fruit flavors that play off each other all the way through the finish, showing a lot of elegance and persistence."
US,90,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Trinchero 2005 Chicken Ranch Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Ripe, fruity and delicious. Flatters with deep, long flavors of blackberries, black currants, cassis and cedar, with a lush, tannic mouthfeel and long finish. Nice now, and should develop beyond 2012."
US,88,25,Pinot Noir,red,Claiborne & Churchill 2009 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"This is classic Edna Valley Pinot Noir: dry, light bodied, with crisp acidity, modest alcohol and forward flavors of raspberry, cherry and cola. Production was just shy of 2,500 cases."
US,90,24,Riesling,white,Trisaetum 2013 Wichmann Dundee Estate Dry Riesling (Dundee Hills),"Newly grafted over from Pinot Gris, this is the first vintage for Wichman Dundee Estate Rieslings. Aromas are gentle and offer a suggestion of rose petals and mint. The palate has a lightly toasted aspect, with medium weight and solid fruit flavors. It's a good effort, but it remains the lightest of the Trisaetum offerings."
US,88,35,Chardonnay,white,Marimar Estate 2006 Don Miguel Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Oaky, dry and acidic, this Chard is saved by the ripeness of the underlying fruit, which gives green apple, peach, pear and pineapple flavors. The acidity hangs in there all the way through the tart finish."
US,90,55,Pinot Noir,red,Rex Hill 2013 Sims Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Tart, young and focused, this brings cranberry and black cherry fruit forward, with a lively, spicy mouthfeel. Flavors are battened down with bracing acidity and firm tannins. Give this an hour or more of breathing time, or decant."
US,86,40,Pinot Noir,red,Youngberg Hill Vineyards 2007 Jordan Block Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"A bit thin and astringent, yet with a powerful, clear focus that conjures up straight cranberry fruit flavors. Baking spices and a hint of cocoa penetrate through the hard shell of acid and tannin. Needs more time."
US,89,32,Pinot Noir,red,Chehalem 2008 3 Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A feminine, almost soft Pinot Noir, this opens nicely with scents of roses, red fruits, and pine forest. Despite its light color, it has plenty of grip and density in the mouth, even bringing some streaks of light milk chocolate into the finish."
US,89,65,Pinot Noir,red,Guarachi Family 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This inviting Pinot is broadly ripe and fully lush in earthy, spicy layers, dark cherry and plum that plays across the palate. With a long, substantial finish, iot suits pork roasts and bacon-wrapped scallops."
US,82,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Silverado 2006 Miller Ranch Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Not much going on in this flat, candy-sweet wine. It tastes like the liquid in canned peaches and pineapples."
US,83,13,Pinot Grigio,white,Main & Geary 2010 Pinot Grigio (California),"A bit heavy, with ripe flavors of apricots, pears and oranges. There's a hint of sweetness. It's a rustic wine, but serve it cold at big parties and don't worry."
US,90,32,Chardonnay,white,Kimmel 2010 Chardonnay (Mendocino County),"From Kimmel's cool Potter Valley vineyards, this 2010 Chardonnay has a lot to offer— refreshing lemon and grapefruit flavor, and a hint of orange peel amid its high-toned acidity. Lean and inviting with a richness on the finish, Kimmel is a name to watch in Mendocino Chardonnay."
US,91,45,Chardonnay,white,Testarossa 2012 Brosseau Vineyard Chardonnay (Chalone),"There's a fascinating presence of herb-roasted chicken to the well-balanced nose of this Chardonnay from the historic Brousseay Vineyard, alongside chalky minerality, golden apple and Asian pear. Once sipped, it's very easy on the palate, with baked apple, wet stone, slight kiwi and a noticeable salinity."
Italy,88,30,Sangiovese,red,Serpaia di Endrizzi 2010 Dono Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano),"Forest floor, menthol, espresso, cranberry and pressed violet aromas take shape in the glass. The lean linear palate shows dried sour cherry, licorice and coffee bean alongside assertive close-grained tannins. Even though the tannins are still firm, drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit."
US,85,25,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Scarborough 2009 Midnight Red Red (Yakima Valley),"This Rhône-style red brings Grenache and Mourvèdre from Meek Vineyard and Syrah from Lewis; good sources both. Hard and fruity, the forward flavors quickly hit a wall of tannin, with hints of dried leaf in a tart, short finish."
US,87,28,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Tolosa 2014 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Edna Valley),"A strong herbal front leads on the nose of this wine, with oregano and thyme notes, alongside lemongrass and a fresh, ripe green fruit element. The broad palate shows hints of green pepper."
US,86,13,Riesling,white,Wagner 2008 Select Riesling (Finger Lakes),"There's a maturity that shines through from the honeyed applesauce and steel aromas in this off-dry Riesling. Rich and full bodied on the palate, bright, fresh apple and lemon flavors linger elegantly on the tongue with a hint of bitter lime pith."
France,88,55,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Brulescaille 2010  Côtes de Bourg,"Still firmly tannic, the wine also promises rich black fruits. It has weight, a solid, firm structure and good balancing acidity. Complex and powerful, it's only spoiled by the show of pepper from the alcohol. Drink from 2016."
US,85,80,Red Blend,red,Sutcliffe 2013 Hafoty Fawr Red (Colorado),"Tart raspberry and blackberry are sharp in this medium- to light-bodied blend, with hints of vanilla and white pepper on the palate. Fleeting tannins leads to a tangy finish."
US,93,70,Pinot Noir,red,Lynmar 2013 Quail Hill Vineyard Old Vines Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"From 40-plus-year-old vines planted on old rootstock, this wine is tangy in pomegranate, rhubarb and kirsch, but marked most by an irresistible depth of earthy truffle and black tea. Fine, dusty tannins add to the complexity of the mouthfeel and finish, with a hint of cinnamon at the end."
US,85,45,Pinot Noir,red,August West 2011 Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Rosella's is a very good vineyard, but this Pinot is unripe and unbalanced. There's an herbal, vegetal note that gets in the way of the cherries and pomegranates. Hard to see it going anywhere, so drink up."
Italy,90,210,Syrah,red,Le Macchiole 2003 Scrio Syrah (Toscana),"Scrio boasts chunky aromas of clove, milk chocolate, coconut and pulsing blueberry. You can definitely identify the hot vintage in the wine's complex DNA although it isn't a big issue in terms of quality. The mouthfeel is polished and firm and the wine's long finish is amazing."
Italy,93,70,Red Blend,red,Michele Satta 2013 Piastraia  (Bolgheri Superiore),"A blend of equal parts of Merlot, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese, this opens with mature blackberry, cedar and underbrush aromas. The juicy, creamy palate delivers black cherry, black currant, mint and tobacco flavors, with velvety tannins and a long finish. Enjoy through 2028."
US,92,45,Pinot Noir,red,David Hill 2014 Old Vine Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"From dry-farmed, own-rooted vines planted in 1965 by Charles Coury, this selection is remarkably fresh and forward. Lush strawberry and black cherry flavors comingle, with chocolaty tannins and exceptional texture, detail and length. It spent 14 months in 30% new French oak. Beginning with the 2015 vintage, it will have national distribution."
Italy,88,55,Red Blend,red,Tenute del Cerro 2009 Antica Chiusina  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"Aromas of mature dark-skinned fruit, game, scorched earth and exotic spice lead the nose. The tight palate offers dried black fruit, toasted oak, roasted coffee bean, grilled sage and a smoky note alongside extremely astringent tannins that dry out the mouth."
US,89,27,Zinfandel,red,Solitary Cellars 2012 East Block Zinfandel (Lodi),"Like a well-made café latte, this wine balances the dry and restrained elements against creamy, mocha nuances that round out the texture and bring an almost sweet, jammy taste to the finish. Just substitute rich blackberry for coffee flavors to make the analogy work."
US,90,25,Chardonnay,white,Beaucanon 1999 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"A rich blend that features toasty oak, vanilla and butterscotch on the nose. On the palate, it serves up a pleasing lineup of melon, apple, honey, spice and toast flavors. Creamy rich on the finish, fleshy and seductive. -J.M."
US,87,24,Chardonnay,white,Woodbury 2012 Barrel Fermented Dry Chardonnay (New York),"Pretty floral and apple aromas are laced with butter and smoke on this supple, elegant Chardonnay. Bright with sunny lemon flavor yet silky and smooth in mouthfeel, it's a satisfying, well-composed wine for any occasion."
US,93,42,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Abeja 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"In this warm, ripe, lush and forward vintage, winemaker John Abbott has outdone himself. This is immediately appealing, sending a rush of black cherry and cassis fruit backed with darker notes of coffee, smoke and licorice. The flavors are dense and supple, and the wine combines grace and power, unfolding with additional layers of tar, green tea and smoky herb."
Italy,86,20,Sangiovese,red,Cavalierino 2015  Rosso di Montepulciano,"As reserved on the nose as on the palate, this Rosso shows faint dried black cherry and licorice notes. The subtlest hint of thyme marks the finish."
US,90,90,Red Blend,red,Kuleto Estate 2012 Danielli Red (Napa Valley),"This combines 61% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Syrah and 11% Cabernet Franc, the trio integrating perfectly, with density and tannic grip. Oaky vanilla notes enwrap jammy blackberry, clove and a dark chocolate flavors, its juiciness lingering long into the finish."
US,87,30,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,:Nota Bene 2010 Una Notte Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The blend is 60% Grenache from the Stone Tree vineyard, the rest Syrah from Stillwater Creek and LVdM vineyards. It's forward, fragrant and fruity, with notes of tanned leather. Bright berry fruit shines through into a finish with moderate tannins."
US,80,18,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Arrow Creek 2011 Coastal Series Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Harsh, sweet and sour, this has a gluey texture that frames the cherry cough-medicine flavors."
US,88,44,Pinot Noir,red,Freeman 2008 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a very pure Pinot Noir. It shows its origins in the silky mouthfeel and crisp acidity, as well as a certain minerality that grounds the raspberry, cherry and cola flavors. It's quite good, but not an ager, so drink soon."
US,96,100,Pinot Noir,red,J. Rochioli 2011 West Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a huge wine that's dense in flavors, rich in tannins, and with the soft lusciousness associated with this vineyard. Made from old vines, it's bold in cherry pie, red currants and mocha, yet dry and resilient on the finish. Delicious as it is now, it's a wine with a successful history for aging. Resist the temptation to drink it now and cellar. Best from 2017 and beyond."
Italy,88,55,Red Blend,red,Campo alla Sughera 2013 Arnione  (Bolgheri Superiore),"In this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot, you'll find delicate aromas of cassis and allspice together with an herbaceous note. The smooth palate delivers mature black-skinned fruit alongside rounded tannins."
France,88,25,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Michel Vattan 2012 Cuvée Argile  (Sancerre),"Argile is French for clay soil, and that terroir gives this wine a full-bodied feel that is ripe and rich. The Sauvignon flavors lean more to tropical, rounded and fruity. It could benefit from some aging, so wait until 2015."
US,91,35,Red Blend,red,àMaurice 2006 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This vintage has the Tsutakawa artist label. Nicely crafted and in good proportion, it's a supple wine with plenty of powerful cassis fruit, backed with licorice. Compact and concentrated, with generous barrel toast, butterfat and smoke."
US,92,40,Pinot Noir,red,Sonnet 2013 Muns Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Fresh, dark strawberry aromas mix with allspice, cinnamon strudel and cherry blossom scents on this wine from a renowned Los Gatos vineyard. The palate is more restrained, quite tight and wound up at first, with cranberry and iron flavors that open to darker red fruits with lots of oregano and garden spices. Drink 2018–2025."
US,89,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Bellangelo 2012 Red (Seneca Lake),"Initially dusty mineral tones blow off to reveal an aromatic bouquet full of fresh lilacs and cassis. Tart blackberry and cherry flavors on the palate are bristling and spry, accented by touch of sage and delicate tannins on the finish."
US,87,20,Chardonnay,white,Inception 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"A dense vanilla-bean character coats a nose of seared white peach and toasted nuts. The palate features thick, ripe fruits, preserved lemon, a touch of walnut and a rocky grip."
US,90,52,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Midnight 2009 Mare Nectaris Reserve Red (Paso Robles),"This Bordeaux-style blend of 25% Merlot, 25% Malbec, 25% Cabernet Franc, 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Petit Verdot greets the nose with purple fruits, cigar box and menthol. The soft palate is saturated with blackberry pie and peppery spice, presented with nicely chalky tannins."
Italy,89,35,Red Blend,red,Castellare di Castellina 2013 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Fragrant purple flower, dark-skinned berry, eucalyptus and aromatic herb aromas lead the way. The bright, no-frills palate offers sour cherry, chopped mint and a hint of clove while lithe tannins add polish. Drink through 2017."
US,84,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cosentino 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa County),"Marked by excessive oak, with toasty-sweet caramel flavors dominating the ripe blackberry and cherry pie flavors. Nice tannins, though. Drink now."
US,83,24,Syrah,red,Arché 2012 Syrah (Texoma),"Craisin and geranium aromas mark the nose of this Texas Syrah. The medium-bodied palate brings more floral tones, soapy in nature, with soft tannins giving little support."
US,87,10,Riesling,white,Oak Knoll 2013 Semi-Sweet Riesling (Willamette Valley),"Veteran producer Oak Knoll remains one of Oregon's most underrated value wineries. This full-bodied, super-fruity Riesling offers bright, off-dry, well-balanced flavors of citrus, honey and tea."
Italy,90,35,Sangiovese,red,Tenuta di Sesta 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,"This opens with tobacco, dark spice, forest floor and leather aromas. The palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and clove flavors, set against tightly wound, taut tannins. It still needs a few years to come together. Drink 2019–2025."
US,90,20,Pinot Grigio,white,Palmina 2015 Pinot Grigio (Santa Barbara County),"Steve Clifton takes this common grape on an uncommonly tasty spin, starting with taut and fresh aromas of green-apple flesh, grapefruit pith and light white flowers. The earthy palate shows river-stone and wet-cement minerality but also Key lime and Gravenstein apple warmth, all wrapped up in a compelling texture."
US,84,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hunt Cellars 2007 Bon Vivant Destiny Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Hot in alcohol, soft in acidity and sweet in berry-cherry fruit, this simple Cabernet earns a point or two for its lush, ripe tannins."
France,84,9,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Château Mas Neuf 1998 Red (Costières de Nîmes),"Exhibits superripe Grenache aromas and flavors of apricots and cherries, all in a midweight format. Some peppery notes chime in on the finish, adding welcome spice to this otherwise soft and fruity wine."
France,82,45,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Frédignac 2013 La Favorite  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"This wine has too much tannin for its own good. It's tough and bitter, showing wood and extraction. In this difficult Bordeaux vintage, the vineyard produced less than half what is normal."
US,89,36,Chardonnay,white,Vino V 2010 Solomon Hills VIneyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Ripe and juicy, this has flavors of tangerine and tropical fruit, plus notes of creamy lees and smoky, sweet oak. It would feel heavy if not for the brisk acidity that provides balance and elegance."
US,89,36,Syrah,red,City Winery of New York 2012 Reserve Alder Springs Vineyard Syrah (Mendocino),"A stalwart, sturdy rendering, this smells like ripe plums and dark spices. It tastes full of fruit but is shaded nicely by slightly smoky, peppery notes. The body is full and the texture firm with tannins and acidity. Best drink this after 2018."
US,92,33,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Chalk Hill 2008 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Chalk Hill),"A bright, beautifully brisk Sauvignon Blanc, marked with crisp acidity and racy flavors of citrus fruits and gooseberries, accented with sweet oak. It's a creamy, deliciously complex wine, and although it's fully dry, it finishes with a honeyed richness."
US,91,95,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Force Majeure 2014 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"The aromas are light initially, with notes of cocoa, herb, barrel spice and cherry not yet fully ready to reveal their charms. The cherry and bittersweet chocolate flavors are backed by lightly grainy tannins that need some time to unwind. The wood is intense at present but there are good things underneath."
US,87,44,Pinot Noir,red,Dierberg 2011 Dierberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"The nose on this estate bottling is sparse at first, with pencil shavings and a speck of boysenberry fruit. It opens more once sipped, delivering a pleasant tartness powered by sour cherry flavors and a tiny bit of clove."
Italy,91,130,Sangiovese,red,Podere Le Ripi 2011 Lupi e Sirene Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"This opens with aromas of ripe black plum, underbrush and a whiff of cassis. On the concentrated palate, notes of tobacco, mint and thyme accent a black cherry core while polished tannins provide the framework. Drink 2018–2024."
US,94,46,Chardonnay,white,Talley 2009 Rosemary's Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley),"A brilliant Chardonnay, bone dry and crisp in acidity. Almost lean in citrus and mineral flavors, but on further inspection shows complex layers of toast, honeysuckle, peach and stone, with a deft touch of new oak. Feels weighty and important, and finishes wonderfully dry."
Italy,84,9,Chardonnay,white,Cabert 2007 Chardonnay (Friuli Grave),"Here's a light, easy Chardonnay from Friuli in Northern Italy that offers measured aromatic intensity and notes of stone fruit, flowers and white mineral. The wine would wash down an easy salad thanks to its lean consistency and fresh finish."
France,93,100,Chardonnay,white,Château de Santenay 2014 La Maltroie Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),"Supposedly set on an ancient burial ground, this vineyard is well placed halfway up the slope of Chassagne. It has almond and spice flavors as well as a tighter, steely texture. The wine, with its wood-aging flavors, is still developing. Drink from 2018."
US,86,24,Zinfandel,red,Napa Cellars 2014 Classic Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"A healthy addition of 13% Petite Sirah provides added weight and intensity to this wine, a soft, supple and richly conceived combination of smoky black fruit and mocha."
US,84,12,Zinfandel,red,Villa Mt. Eden 2007 Grand Reserve Antique Vines Zinfandel (Amador-Napa),"A bit too soft and sweet for Zinfandel, but it sure is delicious in berry fruit, chocolate, pepper and herb flavors. Drink now with barbecue."
France,87,15,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Touzot 2016  Mâcon-Villages,"Bright and fruity, this delicious wine is crisp, clean and refreshing. With yellow fruits followed by zesty acidity, it's both open and textured. Drink now."
US,94,55,Pinot Noir,red,Byron 2014 John Sebastiano Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"There's a great deal of sagebrush on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard in the eastern Sta. Rita Hills, along with red cherry, pencil lead and sandalwood. Dark cherry and cranberry flavors power the palate, the fruit wrapped in hickory smoke. Thyme flavors carry into the tannic finish."
France,86,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château le Grand Paroissien 2003  Haut-Médoc,"and fruity, this packs good, ripe flavors of blackberries, leather, herbs and sweet acidity. The tannins remain firmly dry, structured, leaving fine, black fruits and acidity."
France,86,13,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Cheval Quancard 2010 Prestige de Bordes  (Bordeaux),"This fruity, light and fresh wine offers easy tannins and red berry fruits. It's rounded and juicy, smoothed by wood aging that gives it a ripe aftertaste. Drink now."
US,90,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Fidelitas 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This pure Cabernet is stubbornly unyielding at first, showing a lean and herbal expression. But with extensive (overnight) breathing time, the fresh and bright flavors of boysenberries and cassis pop into focus, the tannins are ripe and polished, the finish still tightly wound but textural and long."
Italy,90,23,Sangiovese,red,San Felice 2011 Il Grigio da San Felice Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"This firmly structured Sangiovese opens with aromas of underbrush, fragrant purple flowers, ripe berry and a whiff of ground pepper. On the savory palate, notes of licorice, clove and espresso add depth to the core of ripe cherry."
US,91,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Summit Lake 2010 Emily Kestrel Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"From a small family-run operation that is 100% estate, this Cab is thick in blueberry and blackberry, almost syrupy rich. With a big juicy backbone, it offers a full-figured body and leathery texture, ending explosively with notes of black licorice and toffee. Cellar through 2020."
US,89,37,Zinfandel,red,Ravenswood 2013 Teldeschi Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This old-vine wine contains 12% Carignane and 8% Petite Sirah, and is one of the larger of the producer's single-vineyard offerings. Feral black fruit and fig form a core of concentrated richness before red-berry pie and vanilla come into play, finishing with a blur of toasty oak."
US,81,28,Merlot,red,Tahoe Ridge 2004 Merlot (Lodi),"With its sugary, baked blackberry fruit, this Merlot is simply too soft and sweet, especially at this price."
US,84,14,Pinot Noir,red,Cambridge & Sunset 2013 California Series Pinot Noir (California),"A good, basic wine, this has a mix of fruity and vegetal aromas, tart cherry and watermelon flavors, firm texture with moderate tannins, medium body and a slightly astringent finish."

It is textured, tense and full of minerality. Drink from 2017."
US,89,18,Red Blend,red,Tamarack Cellars 2014 Firehouse Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A tribute to the art of blending, this wine is a mix of 10 different varieties with none making up even a third of the blend. It leads with aromas of plummy blue fruit, smoke, vanilla and herbs followed by plump fruit flavors and lightly grippy tannins."
France,89,80,Chardonnay,white,Manuel Olivier 2012 Premier Cru  (Meursault),"This is a blend of grapes from a number of Premier Cru parcels. It gives a rich, ripe and fruity wine with a good depth of flavor and strong signs of the wood aging. At this stage, the wood is leaving some bitterness and toast, but this will round out. Drink from 2017."
US,91,50,Pinot Noir,red,Ken Wright 2010 Guadalupe Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Raspberry and cherry fruit, pure and concentrated, introduces the wine aromatically and glides smoothly into the midpalate. It tightens its focus and lingers gracefully, a mouthful of tart, primary, ripe and deliciously fresh fruit."
US,84,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Six Sigma Ranch 2008 Rooster Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),"This is a Marlborough-style Sauvignon Blanc. It's bone dry and crisply acidic, with a firm, minerally finish. The flavors are of limes, lemons and gooseberries, with a potent suggestion of feline intensity."
France,87,25,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Hubert Veneau 2014  Pouilly-Fumé,"This wine is ripe, full in the mouth and rich. With grapefruit tanginess and crisp apple richness, it is generous with its fruits and texture. Like many wines from this appellation, it needs to age, so drink from 2016."
US,91,40,Chardonnay,white,Chasseur 2012 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Fully creamy and generous in crème brûlée and lemon curd, this dances in acidity and is balanced, the texture silky smooth.

The blue-fruit flavors are full bodied and perfumed, showing a pleasing sense of balance and a lingering finish."
US,87,24,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Stinson 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Monticello),"Grapefruit spray and gooseberry aromas jump from the glass initially, with an herbal tomato-leaf tone lingering behind. Lemon-lime acidity cuts through the medium-bodied palate of underripe peach and tropical fruit, leading to a talc-dusted finish. This is zesty, lively and perfectly enjoyable as an apéritif or paired alongside tangy cheese."
France,91,36,Red Blend,red,Clos Teddi 2014 Grande Cuvée Red (Patrimonio),"Just maturing, this is a rich, wood-aged wine. Its tannins have softened and melted into its ripe dark plum and black fruit flavors and concentrated structure. A serious wine, it's powered by a dry core and rich fruitiness. Drink from 2018."
US,88,18,Merlot,red,Blacksmith 2012 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This appealing wine features notes of woodspice, herbs, mint, coffee and jammy red fruit. It's full bodied in feel with coffee and red fruit flavors that linger."
US,89,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Firestone 2013 The Chairman Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"Deep blueberry and blackcurrant aromas waft off this bottling, as do scents of oak smoke and beef char. It's thick in the glass, with sticky tannins and strong acidity that present flavors of boisterous blackberry, tar, pepper, dark chocolate and dried herbs."
US,88,20,Chardonnay,white,Alder Fels 2015 The Eagle Rock Chardonnay (California),"Bright green apple and herb flavors and light to medium body make this non-oaky wine refreshing and lean in profile. It has appetizing acidity, a great sense of freshness and a lingering finish."
France,94,80,Chardonnay,white,Alex Gambal 2014 La Maltroie Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),"Crisp and packed with lively lemon-like acidity, this wine shows both minerality and intense fruitiness.

Italy,86,13,Sangiovese,red,Tenuta San Jacopo 2010 Poggio ai Grilli  (Chianti),"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of wet leaves, underbrush, leather and prune. The palate offers dried red and black cherry, grilled sage and a confectionary note alongside lithe tannins. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit."
France,86,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château l'Avocat 2006  Graves,"Classically structured, which means dry tannins mixed with fresh black currant juice, and set over a bed of tight wood. This is a firm wine, perhaps lean for the vintage, but with a sense of balance and structure."
US,94,48,Chardonnay,white,Benovia 2014 La Pommeraie Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A rich, voluptuous nose gives way to crisp layers of lemon, pineapple and quince flavors in this barrel-kissed and full-bodied white. The ripeness of the fruit is brightened by stony minerality, allowing for a floral bite of apple blossom."
France,89,21,Pinot Gris,white,Pierre Sparr 2010 Réserve Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Spice and cream combine in a rounded, soft, very ripe wine. It has intense flavors of lychee and white peach with a refreshing amount of acidity. The wine is dry, but rich from the ginger and with a peppery final bite."
US,92,60,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Betz Family 2014 Clos de Betz Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Merlot (71%) takes the lead on this blend followed by Cabernet Sauvignon (19%) and Petit Verdot. It opens with aromas of herb, plum, pencil lead, smoke and barrel spice. The palate packs a mouthful of red and black-fruit flavors, showing an impeccable sense of balance and styling, followed by an extended finish."
Italy,90,35,Red Blend,red,Canonica a Cerreto 2010  Chianti Classico,"Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this opens with aromas of forest floor, blue flower, black fruit, graphite and a balsamic note.

US,87,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Murphy-Goode 2012 Poker Knight Cabernet Sauvignon (Knights Valley),"Weighted in tannins and oak, this wine is also perfumed in ripe berry and chocolate, along with dried herb. Bittersweet tobacco marks the finish, complemented in vanilla."
US,85,25,Chardonnay,white,Terra Sávia 2006 Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (Mendocino),"A bit rough and scoury in texture, but otherwise this dry sparkling wine has rich, complex flavors of citrus fruits, strawberries, brioche and vanilla. Shows fine Mendocino acidity that makes it finish brisk and clean."
France,86,10,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Champ du Moulin 2015  Bordeaux,"Produced from organically grown grapes, this is a ripe, easy and fruity wine. It has light tannins, juicy black-currant fruit and acidity. It is still young, showing off its fruitiness and will be ready to drink soon, from early 2017."
US,89,27,Zinfandel,red,Miraflores 2010 Estate Zinfandel (El Dorado),"A soft, well-integrated mountain Zin gifted in sweet raspberry and leather, balanced completely between juicy and savory. The finish lingers for a long time, and the wine's acidity accommodates a range of foods, from the expected barbecue and other grilled meats to risotto or gourmet pizza."
US,85,20,Red Blend,red,Martinez & Martinez 2008 César Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon, this blend also has Sangiovese, Syrah and Merlot. The result is a pleasant, unfocused red wine, with candied flavors of berry and cherry, plus some tannic bite. Drink up."
US,90,23,Riesling,white,N. Kendall Wines 2012 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"2012 marks only the second vintage for winemaker Nathan Kendall, but this dry, exceptionally stony Riesling suggests a promising start already. Fermented spontaneously with indigenous yeast, it's exquisitely spry but concentrated in lime, blossom and white grapefruit notes."
US,88,52,Pinot Noir,red,Nicholson Ranch 2013 Estate Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Cherry-vanilla and cola provide a voluptuous, full-bodied outline for this estate-grown wine, given 20 months in French oak, one-quarter of it new."
US,86,28,Red Blend,red,Patit Creek Cellars 2007 Roux Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"About half Cabernet, the rest a Bordeaux mix, this opens nicely with forward plum and cherry fruit. There are notes of savory herbs in the nose, but the wine turns astringent and the finish a little chalky and stemmy."
US,86,50,Red Blend,red,Bending Branch 2012 Estate Cuvée Red (Texas),"This is an approachable blend of Aglianico, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Mourvédre, Petite Sirah and Tempranillo, melding ripe dark cherry, vanilla and cedar on the nose and palate. A plush and soft texture makes this wine perfect for everyday consumption, especially when barbecue is involved."
US,92,25,Riesling,white,Standing Stone 2014 Ice Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Layers of sweet orange marmalade, citrus rind and pollen mingle seamlessly into this deliciously honeyed ice wine. Intensely ripe, almost creamy in texture, its succulent sweetness is balanced neatly by a dazzling spray of tangerine acidity."
US,89,26,Zinfandel,red,Neyers 2015 Vista Luna Zinfandel,"Ripe fruit flavors and chocolate accents give opulent character to this full-bodied wine. The flavors are suggestive of late-picked grapes, raisins and ripe figs, while the texture is easy and almost soft, with no tannic bite."
US,92,26,Merlot,red,Steltzner 1999 Merlot (Stags Leap District),"There's lots to admire in this well-ripened, elegant dinner wine. It has aromas of green olives, white chocolate, and plums, with a waft of smoky oak, while the flavors are spicy and fruity. Bone-dry, it's richly tannic and complex, with depth and interest."
US,89,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Schug 2012 Heritage Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Fruit is sourced from multiple sites, including Sangiacomo and Rancho Salina for this elegant wine which is slight in black and blue fruit with a subtle notion of leather. Structurally, it has a deep complexity of tannins that remains integrated on the back of the palate. It's ready for the table."
France,87,14,Pinot Noir,red,Willm NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace),"With just a touch of bitterness and structure, this is a finely textured wine. It has plenty of fresh red and white fruit flavors, a lively, busy mousse and a tight acidity on the finish."
US,88,45,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Andrew Rich 2014 Glacial Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is a blend of 52% Syrah, 26% Mourvèdre and 22% Grenache. Aromas of black licorice, herb, barrel spice and cassis are out front. The palate is chock-full of black fruit flavors that bring a dry, lightly astringent feel."
US,93,21,Pinot Noir,red,Felten Cellars 2011 Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"Buttery-crusted cranberry pie aromas meet with smoked meats, pencil lead and beef jerky on the nose of this private-label wine by longtime producer Stephen Felten, who has more than 40 years of winemaking experience. The palate shows brown flavors, from dried oregano and marjoram to coffee beans and mocha, with a bit of smoked red-cherry fruit."
US,90,74,Pinot Noir,red,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2013 Trenton Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Earth and black tea meet forest floor notes in this dark, brooding and powerfully full-bodied wine. A touch of reduction accentuates the profuse oak, recalling clove and cardamom, as tingling acidity vies for attention and integration."
US,92,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Anthony Nappa 2013 The Savage Cabernet Sauvignon (North Fork of Long Island),"Long Island is not typically known for Cabernet Sauvignon, but in the hands of winemaker Anthony Nappa (who also crafts excellent Cabs at Raphael), the variety shows remarkable promise. Juxtaposing heady notes of bramble and dried herb against a backdrop of luscious black currant and plum, this wild-fermented red is enticingly “savage” in style. Sharp cranberry notes and mineral tones lend edge to a lingering finish."
US,86,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Donati 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paicines),"The dryness and low alcohol are praiseworthy, but more challenging are hard tannins and biting acidity. With blackberry and sweet green-herb flavors, it's the opposite of today's ripe cult style, but by no means unattractive."
US,92,17,Pinot Noir,red,J. Lohr 2012 Estates Falcon's Perch Pinot Noir (Monterey County),"Deep, inviting aromas of cherry, strawberry and cranberry mesh with red licorice, violet and nutmeg on this superbly priced wine. It's a fleshy Pinot, named after a falcon that perches in the vineyard's lone pine tree, with pretty, punch-like flavors of violet, rose and more red fruit."
US,88,38,Merlot,red,Swanson 2010 Merlot (Oakville),"This isn't a wine to age. It's soft and appealing in its charms, offering drink-me-now cherries, red currants, herbs and sandalwood. The winemaker blended it with a little Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Verdot, which gives it structural and flavor complexities."
US,92,65,Syrah,red,Va Piano 2014 Stoney Vine Vineyard Black Label Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Herb, stem, green olive and floral aromas lead to generous fruit and savory flavors that carry though the finish. It shows a lot of finesse and a beautiful sense of balance."
US,90,55,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hendry 2012 Hendry Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Muted aromatics hide beneath thick, leathery tannins and a puckering structure of crisp red currant and cranberry in this full-bodied wine that will benefit from time. Cellar through 2020."
US,95,75,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Aleksander 2011 Red (Paso Robles),"From a label owned by former L.A. Laker Sasha Vujacic, this Merlot-dominant wine delivers aromas of bricks, dust, black cherries, dried oregano and cedar, the sense of ripe but serious fruit lingering in the background. The energetic, grippy palate is reminiscent of Vietnamese coffee—creamy yet properly bitter, rich and flavorful—with blueberry and tart blackberry fruit proving lush and welcoming."
Italy,85,19,Pinot Grigio,white,Endrizzi 2014 Pinot Grigio (Trentino),This simple white opens with scents of honeysuckle and ripe orchard fruit while the easygoing palate offers hints of nectarine and green apple. Fresh acidity gives it a brisk finish.
US,94,35,Chardonnay,white,Hunnicutt 2008 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"A beautiful Chardonnay for drinking now. It's dry and crisp, with pineapple, peach and pear flavors accented with vanilla oak and creaminess from lees aging. Despite the richness, there's a firm minerality, a tang of steel that makes the wine bracing. The grapes are from a vineyard in the southerly, cool Coombsville area, an area that needs its own appellation."
US,91,23,Chardonnay,white,Gainey 2010 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"This shows an evident layer of oak in the form of buttered toast and vanilla notes, but the underlying wine is strong in pineapple and golden mango flavors. Fine coastal acidity and a hint of mineral provide structural balance."
France,90,85,Pinot Noir,red,Joseph Drouhin 2007 Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),"Finely perfumed, a wine that has some elegant structure, sweet red-berry fruits and a light acidity. The texture is gentle, soft and rounded, ready to drink now."
US,93,32,Zinfandel,red,Kokomo 2012 Timber Crest Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"There's something special about this Zin, given a handful of Petite Sirah for aromatic depth. It opens with supple, high-toned raspberry and cherry before delving into a layering of dusty, cinnamon spice. Juicy, alive and fresh, it delivers a cherry-vanilla finish."
US,93,38,Chardonnay,white,La Follette 2012 Sangiacomo Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Crisp and balanced in bright acidity and apple skin, this also offers subtle toasted oak and caramel, the best of both worlds, exuberant and elegant at the same time. Enjoy now or cellar until 2020."
France,88,55,Chardonnay,white,Forget-Brimont NV Blanc de Blancs Premier Cru Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"Ripe and full, this comes from a producer based just south of the Côtes de Blancs. Yellow fruits are cut with citrus to give a rich, while refreshing wine. Smooth with an orange-zest texture, it is ready to drink."
France,94,190,Pinot Noir,red,Chanson Père et Fils 2008  Charmes-Chambertin,"Big, full-bodied wine, the great tannins dominating the underlying red fruit. It's firmly concentrated, intense, a powerhouse of dense texture and obviously a wine that will need aging. Give it 5–6 years."
US,84,10,Pinot Grigio,white,Glen Ellen 2010 Proprietor's Reserve Pinot Grigio (California),"This big bottle of Pinot Grigio has strong aromas of peach and is pretty full in flavor though not in finish. Not a lot of acidity here, but the wine is fine for the price and volume. No problem next to a plate of spicy paella."
Italy,90,115,Red Blend,red,Monteverro 2011 Tinata Red (Toscana),"A blend of 70% Syrah and 30% Grenache, this robust red opens with aromas of ripe, black-skinned fruit, cedar and ground pepper. The concentrated palate doles out fleshy black cherries and black currants accented by licorice and allspice. Velvety tannins and the heat of evident alcohol provide the framework. It will definitely appeal to fans of bold, muscular wines, but it's shy on freshness so drink now."
US,90,25,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Ousterhout 2016 Redwood Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley),"With initial weightiness and fullness on the palate, this wine ultimately delivers crisp, cool peach and melon flavors, a lingering lemon zest note adding to its freshness."
US,88,15,Syrah,red,Redd Brand 2009 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Mixed in with the Syrah are small amounts of Merlot and Tempranillo. The structure is firm and carries generous acids, while the flavors suggest citrus and berry, vanilla and chocolate. It delivers a lot of pleasure for the modest price."
Italy,90,50,Red Blend,red,Tenute Salvaterra 2008  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"Aromas of toast, prune, dried earth, leather and a balsamic note emerge on this full-bodied wine. The structured palate delivers dried black cherry, mocha, tobacco and a touch of baking spice accompanied by a network of tightly woven tannins."
US,87,17,Sangiovese,red,Holly's Hill 1999 Sangiovese (California),"Lightish in color, it opens with earthy, tobacco aromas, a hint of mint and, if you really concentrate, blackberries. It's very limpid in the mouth, light as a feather, but the fruit is great. The concentrated blackberry taste is dry and flavorful, with wonderful acids. This is a very individualistic wine, and fun to drink."
France,85,11,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine Uby 2014 No. 1 Sauvignon Sauvignon Blanc (Côtes de Gascogne),"Flowery and fresh, this is a classic cool-climate white. Fragrant acidity is balanced by the citrus and pear flavors. Fruity and crisp, it is ready to drink."
France,91,120,Syrah,red,Jean-Luc Colombo 2013 Vallon de l'Aigle  (Cornas),"From 70-year-old vines, this cedar-tinged wine reflects its maturation in one-third new oak. Brown sugar, cracked pepper and plum notes mingle easily into a pleasant, silky Cornas that should have broad appeal. Drink now–2025."
France,88,15,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Léon Perdigal 2014 Red (Côtes du Rhône),"This is a juicy, medium- to full-bodied blend of Grenache, Syrah, Cinsault and Mourvèdre. Berry-like fruit picks up some herbal, tea-like notes on the finish, creating mouthwatering tension. Drink now."
France,94,86,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Laroche 2010 Les Blanchots Grand Cru  (Chablis),"Structured and minerally, this has citrus fruits that sit prominently over the tight acidity. A vanilla note is there to round the wine out. The crisp fruits and steely acids are intense and impressively balanced. Age for at least 5 years. Screwcap."
US,87,35,Red Blend,red,Kuleto Estate 2010 Native Son Red (Napa Valley),"Feels a little off in the mouth, with edgy tannins that give it a sandpapery texture. But it's interesting in flavor, showing everything from black cherries and currants to tobacco, pepper, salted charred beef fat, persimmons and cola. The multi-variety blend includes Zinfandel, Sangiovese and Merlot."
US,95,60,Syrah,red,Reynvaan Family Vineyards 2012 In the Hills Estate Foothills in the Sun Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A wine glass can hardly contain this lightly colored wine's generous aromas of black olive, sea salt, crushed flowers, orange peel, black pepper, mineral and smoked meat. The smoke and savory flavors display a fascinating mixture of lightness and intensity, leading to a floral finish that seems near endless."
US,96,55,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,J. Bookwalter 2009 Conner Lee Vineyard Conflict Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The Conflict red is a mash-up of 38% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Franc, and it's a crowd-pleaser from the instant the cork is pulled. Dense scents of cherry, roasty-toasty barrel and cracker are inviting. The grapes were sourced entirely from the Conner Lee Vineyard. This effort showcases the winery's signature style, with notes of black fruits, exotic spices, coffee grounds and dark chocolate. Drink now or cellar for 6–8 years."
France,90,56,Chardonnay,white,De Sousa & Fils NV Blanc de Blancs Réserve Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),A ripe and rounded wine with a touch of oygenation to give extra complexity and ripe fruit. Flavors are of pineapple and peach as well as a good citric content. Elegant and fresh as well as rich.
US,88,34,Pinot Noir,red,Boedecker Cellars 2005 Athena Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Aromatic and floral, this lovely bottle has a tangy, nicely defined core of raspberry, cranberry and pomegranate. The tannins are crisp, the acids bracing, the fruit etched in minerals, and the balance poised and appropriate to the lightness of the wine."
US,90,48,Pinot Noir,red,Big Table Farm 2014 Cattrall Brothers Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Tangy cranberry fruit carries light impressions of stem, in a compact frame. This single vineyard offering gains depth as it breathes, and shows enough stuffing for some mid-length cellar potential. Drink 2018–2024."
US,85,20,Merlot,red,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2008 Estate Merlot (Alexander Valley),"A good, somewhat rustic Merlot, with cherry liqueur, sweet tobacco and white pepper flavors. Drink this pleasant wine now with a nice roast chicken."
France,83,14,Chardonnay,white,Eric Louis 2016 Alphonse Dolly Les Doigts d'Or de Dolly Chardonnay (Vin de France),"Soft, rounded and fruity, with apple flavors, this is pretty anonymous in character. Drink now."
France,94,164,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Valandraud 2013  Saint-Émilion,"This wine is rich with jammy fruits and ripe acidity. Firm tannins are only just making a mark on the sweet, fleshy fruitiness. It revels in its concentrated fruit and in the dark tannins that are still at the back. This wine will certainly age, dense while always fresh and juicy at the end. Drink from 2022."

US,89,32,Pinot Noir,red,The Four Graces 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"For a (relatively) mass production Oregon Pinot, this offers excellent flavors and comparatively good value. A seductive nose leads into a plush palate mixing berries, cola, clean earth and rock. It's textural and balanced, with enough complexity to keep you coming back to the glass."
US,87,12,Red Blend,red,14 Hands 2013 Limited Release Kentucky Derby Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. Aromas of barrel spice, herb and coffee lead to easy-going vanilla and coffee flavors. Barrel notes are dominant but it brings appeal."

US,90,16,Riesling,white,Billsboro 2013 Sawmill Creek Vineyards Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Orange blossoms, grapefruit piths and freshly cut pineapple explode on the nose of this perfumed, yet impeccably elegant Riesling. It's gossamer-light in texture, but deeply concentrated with generous streaks of ripe yellow peach and tangerine. A bristle of bitter lime zest accompanies a long finish. Gorgeous now but substantial enough to mature well though at least 2023."
US,88,32,Syrah,red,Novy 2011 Rosella's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Hard tannins, dryness and brisk acidity can't hide the enormous core of blackberries and currants.

Italy,88,55,Sangiovese,red,Fattoria dei Barbi 2010  Brunello di Montalcino,"The light garnet color, brick rim and tertiary aromas indicate this is evolving quickly.

It offers a complex assortment of herbs, including thyme and sage, along with floral notes, blackberry and anise. It's restrained yet fully flavored with a captivating feel and firm, fine-grained tannins. A complete dazzler that will only improve with some additional time in the cellar. Best from 2014 on."
US,92,60,Pinot Noir,red,Blue Rock 2014 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"The producer sources from three sites, each vineyard-designate worthy: Cleary Ranch and Rayhill Vineyard in Freestone, and Stiling Vineyard in Russian River Valley. Together they sing, coaxing spicy white pepper and clove from the grapes while a velvety texture of firm tannin provides support. Raspberry and baked cherry highlight the fruit flavors."

US,89,40,Syrah,red,Canoe Ridge 2012 Limited Edition Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"The aromas of huckleberry, flowers and blueberry are bright, with a dark-chocolate top note. The palate is full bodied and rich, made in a hedonistic style with a tart finish."
US,94,85,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hunnicutt 2006 9-3-5 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Quite a good, distinguished Cabernet. It's rich and robust, with explosive blackberry and currant flavors, liberally coated with smoky oak, that finish in a swirl of chocolate. Most exquisite are the tannins, so pure and refined. The name refers to the number of barrels in the blend, which comes from St. Helena, Rutherford and Spring Mountain."
US,88,18,Chardonnay,white,Whitecliff Vineyard 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Hudson River Region),"Sultry vanilla, smoke and bergamot notes thread languorously on the nose of this intensely perfumed Chardonnay. The palate is more subdued, showing zesty red apple and lemon anchored by a crisp acidic backbone. It's a touch woody now but could balance out with a few more years of bottle aging."
France,89,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château la Roque de By 2014  Médoc,"From one of the estates owned by the Pagès family in the northern Médoc, the wine is spicy and rich with tannins and blackberry fruit.

Drink now."

US,92,50,Zinfandel,red,Renwood 2014 Sea of Grapes Vineyard Zinfandel (Amador County),"Another outstanding Renwood vineyard designate, this has great structure and abundant fruit flavors without overt oakiness. Full-bodied, smooth and seamless, exudes a wild berry and mineral character in the aroma and flavor, and keeps everything in balance due to moderate tannins and acidity."

France,94,70,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Ducru Beaucaillou 2004  Saint-Julien,"Impressively dense, dark flavored wine, very rich and quite extracted. But it still keeps the elegance and some of the freshness of 2004, and there is plenty of blackberry flavor to push the wine along. Heavier than many 2004s, it still shows that great acidity."
US,85,32,Merlot,red,Tertulia 2007 Pepper Bridge Vineyard Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is a bit sweaty in the nose, with a mousy undertaste that takes some time to blow off. Sour and unresolved; nothing really connects here. Very tart, with unripe citrus, pale red fruits, and a little toast and chocolate."
US,90,30,Chardonnay,white,La Crema 2012 Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),"Made in a drier, tarter style than the winery's Russian River bottling, this Chard favors elegance over opulence. It's streamlined and crisp, with subtle notes of green apples, kumquats and honey, gently touched by smoky oak."

France,95,142,Pinot Noir,red,Roche de Bellene 2014  Corton,"While the color of this wine is light, the intensity and the structure are not.

US,84,19,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Dead On 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"Lots of green, less-than-ripe gooseberry and ammonia flavors in this bone-dry wine. The tartness is relieved by some riper peaches and limes, but it's still pretty severe."
US,84,35,Zinfandel,red,V. Sattui 2009 Mounts Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"There's an unripe, green edge to this Zinfandel that detracts from its appeal. Yet it has some good blackberry fruit, and it's nicely dry and tannic. Pair this with rich meats and cheeses to coax out the sweetness."
US,90,30,Chardonnay,white,Bucher 2014 Unoaked Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Austere and elegant, this wine opens in the glass to deliver fresh-cut apple, matchstick and graham cracker, balancing fruit-forwardness with complexity. From an estate property with only two acres planted to the variety, the rest to Pinot Noir, it exudes its Middle Reach roots, ripe and fresh, and entirely aged in stainless steel."
France,90,20,Pinot Gris,white,Domaine Roland Schmitt 2012 Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Very spicy, full-in-the-mouth wine. It has just the right amount of acidity to keep it fresh, but its main thrust is towards rich pepper and weight. At the end, a tighter mineral character appears. Keep for 2–3 years."
US,86,22,Chardonnay,white,Kendall-Jackson 2012 Grand Reserve Chardonnay (Monterey-Santa Barbara),"Lots of oaky flavors mark this dry wine. Buttered toast, brown butter and vanilla flavors dominate the underlying peach, pear, citrus and mango flavors."
France,86,13,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Vrai Caillou 2012  Bordeaux Supérieur,"The wine is full of ripe berries, red and black fruit flavors. Soft tannins are a subtext to the main fruitiness. Although the tannins are still dry, they will soften to give a fresh wine that will age quickly. Drink from 2016."
France,90,65,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Château Tour des Gendres 2014 Anthologia Parcelle No A299 Sauvignon Blanc (Bergerac Sec),"This single-parcel wine is rich and with layers of wood aging in the flavor, giving a spicy slightly toasty character. Behind that, there is a more herbal green-fruit character that is crisp with acidity and with a tangy, zesty aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
US,90,36,Zinfandel,red,Cellars 33 2013 Bacigalupi Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Piquant in allspice, this soft, single-vineyard designate from a property known for Pinot Noir conveys a sense of elegance and subdued tannins, offering plum and red cherry atop shy waves of cedar and sage. A smoky component on the robust finish makes it memorable."
US,85,23,Chardonnay,white,Otium 2011 Chardonnay (Virginia),"Subdued notes of butterscotch and flaky pie crust mark this Chardonnay's nose. It is a buttery, waxy-textured selection with tame acidity, and it would pair well with steamed lobster in a casual setting."
US,90,22,Merlot,red,Canoe Ridge 2009 Vineyard Select Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This 100% estate-grown Merlot opens with meaty aromas of plum and black cherry. There is a pleasant, roasted character to the flavors, with nutmeg and cinnamon spice. Still youthful and tight, this breathes open into a supple wine with a finishing streak of pencil lead."
US,93,60,Pinot Noir,red,Clendenen Family 2007 Le Bon Climat Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Ultrarich and spicy, with exotic flavors of bacon, cherry pie, cola and sandalwood. Notable for its structure, so dry and sturdy in tannins, yet so silky. A big, full-bodied wine, it should develop bottle complexity over the next four years."
US,91,30,Pinot Noir,red,Lenné Estate 2014 LeNez Pinot Noir,"This fruit-forward, entry level release is nonetheless all estate grown and spent just under a year in French oak. It's a supple flavorful mix of plum and cherry fruit, accented with iron filings, lead pencil and dark chocolate."
US,85,18,Riesling,white,Wedge Mountain 2010 Dry Riesling (Washington),"Wedge Mountain makes a Riesling that is as bone dry as any Riesling can possibly be. It's consistent, and styled for slurping with fresh oysters more than anything. Mouth-puckering acidity, lean citrus fruits and a lingering sense of sucking on a ripe lemon."
US,87,22,Riesling,white,Chehalem 2013 Three Vineyard Riesling (Willamette Valley),"As with all the 2013 white wines from Chehalem, the alcohol is way down and the acids up in this blend of the three estate vineyards. All-stainless fermented, it's quite tart with green apple and grapefruit flavors dominating."
US,88,17,Pinot Gris,white,Tangent 2012 Paragon Vineyard Pinot Gris (Edna Valley),"There's a honeyed finish to this unoaked wine along with peach, Meyer lemon and nectarine flavors. Vibrant acidity makes it a clean and vibrant Pinot Gris."
US,90,95,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Obelisco Estate 2010 Estate Grown III Nefer Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"The estate's reserve, this pure Cabernet Sauvignon has been given 22 months in new French oak. Sculpted and well-defined, it offers raspberry and blueberry fruit, set in lovely tannins. The finish shows details of orange blossoms, citrus and coffee grounds. At this time, the new oak is a bit overwhelming, but additional bottle age or decanting for several hours will help to balance it out."
France,86,12,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château la Rose Belair 2010  Bordeaux Supérieur,This is a bright and fruity red-currant and berry-fruited wine. It has some richness along with a more stalky edge. Wood aging shows subtly along with the firm tannins of the vintage. Drink from 2014.
US,84,35,Pinot Noir,red,Castello di Borghese 1998 Hargrave Vineyard Pinot Noir (North Fork of Long Island),"The dominant aromas are smoke, toast, and cinnamon, which ride over tart-cherry fruit.  Turns quite stemmy and tough on the finish.  Drink young--with a piece of rare beef to help tame the tannins."
US,90,50,Chardonnay,white,Kathryn Kennedy 2004 Twenty-Seven Blanc de Blanc Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Just-cracked, yeasty sourdough bread and dried lemon-skin aromas float off of this bottle-aged sparkler from an esteemed, longtime producer. Her winemaker son named this wine in honor of her birth year. An oxidative warmth gives bready depth to the palate, which shows lots of toast and lemon marmalade flavors."
Italy,89,35,Red Blend,red,Val delle Rose 2013 Poggio al Leone Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano),"Fresh and easygoing, this opens with scents of berry, blue flower and a whiff of baking spice. The light-bodied, simple palate offers tart cherry, black currant and a hint of espresso alongside soft, not very persistent tannins."
US,89,50,Zinfandel,red,Williams Selyem 2008 Feeney Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"So rich and powerful in fruit. Blackberry and cherry jam, mocha, cola, tobacco, black pepper, anise, licorice, beef jerky, it's all there, on steroids."
US,89,15,Chardonnay,white,Matchbook 2015 Estate Bottled Old Head Chardonnay (Dunnigan Hills),"Rich and oaky, this wine gives plenty of flavor at reasonable price. It has an abundance of baking spice, butter and toasted-baguette flavors, full body and a pleasantly viscous texture."
Italy,86,50,Sangiovese,red,Castello Tricerchi 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,"French oak, coconut and spice aromas follow through to the lean palate, where they're joined by sour cherry and vanilla flavors. Grainy, fleeting tannins give it an abrupt finish."
US,90,63,Syrah,red,Sweet Cheeks 2014 Limited Edition Winemaker Series Syrah (Applegate Valley),"An excellent effort, this deserves its “limited” designation, and not just because it's a three-barrel selection. Dense raspberry and black cherry anchor a substantial wine with plenty of well-ripened tannins. Spending 22 months in one-quarter new French oak adds streaks of dark chocolate and espresso. The acid-tannin balance is spot-on."
US,92,50,Red Blend,red,Ancient Peaks 2011 Oyster Ridge Red (Paso Robles),"The top-level bottling from the ambitious, sprawling property originally planted by the Mondavis, this vintage-varying blend of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 44% Merlot, 4% Petite Sirah and 4% Malbec offers licorice, German chocolate cake, blackberry jam, violet extract and night jasmine on the detailed nose. It's visceral once sipped, with thick jammy blueberry and plum fruits, bloody meats, leather, dark chocolate and coffee grinds."
France,93,120,Chardonnay,white,J. Dumangin Fils NV Cuvée Firmin Brut Nature Chardonnay (Champagne),"Named after the first Dumangin to own vineyards (in the 17th century), this is part of a limited-release family-ancestor series. From a single parcel, it is a mineral, taut wine, full of white fruits with a lemon twist. It is fresh, bright and ready to drink."
US,93,39,Zinfandel,red,Sineann 2015 Old Vine Zinfandel (Columbia Valley (OR)),"These Pines Vineyard vines are nearing a century in age. In the new vintage, the wine seems almost brutally powerful, with rough, rugged oak flavors that will want further bottle age to mellow. Ripe blueberry and cherry tones are matched to strong streaks of caramel, cocoa and coconut. Drink 2018–25."
US,92,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Barra of Mendocino 2015 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino),"Concentrated earthy, meaty and spicy aromas precede layered, dense flavors of espresso, cassis and cherries as this full-bodied, velvety wine coats the palate and clings to the sides of the mouth. It has extraordinary depth, showing lavish but appropriate oak accents and a delicious lingering finish."
US,87,19,Riesling,white,Standing Stone 2013 Old West Block Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Waxy white florals and lifted apple aromas add freshness to slightly cider-like flavors of pressed apple and mulling spice in this dry Riesling. Delicately light bodied it has a brisk, refreshing finish."
US,94,79,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Woodward Canyon 2012 Estate Reserve Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This blend is near-equal parts Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon along with a healthy dollop of Petit Verdot (18%). It shows a mix of fruit and savory elements, with notes of potting soil, green coffee bean, mocha, fresh herbs, licorice, generous barrel spices and red and black fruit—showing more with each swirl. The fruit and chocolate flavors are dense and rich, with bright acids and a firm core of tannins. The balance is spot-on and the finish lingers. It drinks beautifully now but you can expect it to age for another 20 years."
US,89,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Roberts & Rogers 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Big, powerful and flashy, this is made in the modern cult style, showing ripeness, high alcohol and oakiness. The blackberry and cassis flavors are classic Napa, while the texture is smooth and mellow, but as heady as cognac."
US,91,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Pegasus Estate 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"Deep blackberry syrup, chipped slate and sharp black-plum skins show on the nose of this bottling. The tannins are very chalky and a bit overwhelming on the palate at first, but then open to reveal zesty but dense blackberry fruit and a touch of peppercorn. A solid choice now, it will be even better in a couple years."
US,89,48,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Steven Kent 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"A minty, tomato-leafy Cabernet with 12% Petit Verdot and 3% Merlot, this is an accessible, round-tannin wine, elegant and tempting in cardamom spice. The flavors ping pong between dark chocolate and dark cherries, with enough density to pair well with filet mignon and enough high-toned acidity to drink before that steak is done."
US,87,24,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Bernardus 2016 Griva Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Arroyo Seco),"Chilled tangerines and honeysuckle show on the interesting nose of this bottling, along with a pleasant touch of baked apple. The palate offers black lime and kaffir lime leaves, plus a yellow-apple-flesh component in the midpalate."
Italy,85,20,Red Blend,red,Duca di Salaparuta 2009 Calanìca Frappato-Syrah Red (Sicilia),"This version of Calanìca (made from 60% Frappato and 40% Syrah) offers a low impact bouquet of earthy forest fruit and bramble. It's a light, lean wine with a touch of soft spice on the close."
France,92,70,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Chevillon-Chezeaux 2014 Les Bousselots Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),"On one of the many steep slopes above Nuits Saint-Georges, this vineyard produces wines with much of the classic structure of the appellation. This is rich, full of firm tannins and with a solid structure and future. Blackberry flavors are dark and intense and the wine needs time. Drink from 2019."
US,93,70,Pinot Noir,red,Patton Valley 2012 Lorna Marie Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The winery's reserve-level bottling, this has the extra concentration to warrant the designation. Tart young berry/cherry fruit carries the brunt of the midpalate. The barrel treatment is delicately balanced, bringing in nuances of toast, coconut and almond. Very well made, and cellarworthy. Drink now through 2025."
US,93,19,Pinot Gris,white,Sokol Blosser 2012 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"This is a powerful wine, with intense scents of pineapple leading a lively interplay of citrus, stone, Asian pear and spices. Thrilling texture, balance and length make this a standout, even in this outstanding vintage for all Pinot Gris."
US,85,20,Pinot Gris,white,Benziger 2000 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"Strikes a middle-of-the-road pose, combining a nice apple and watermelon fruitiness with a little softness, a little sweetness and enough acidity to make it balanced. It's an easy wine to like and to pair with casual foods."
US,90,22,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Bink 2013 Randle Hill Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Yorkville Highlands),"Subtle flavors, great balance and some mineral complexity add interest. It is tangy, refreshing and just a bit restrained until the finish, where it opens up and stays with you."
US,88,50,Pinot Noir,red,Argyle 2014 Nuthouse Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Light strawberry fruit with tart acidity carries a wine of modest proportions. It's drinking well, and might be a good choice for a simple salmon preparation, as it would not overwhelm the fish. The finishing tannins have a definite herbal flavor."
US,87,36,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,The Williamsburg Winery 2009 Gabriel Archer Reserve Red (Virginia),"A blend of 44% Petit Verdot, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Malbec, 12% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc, this is dressed with brown spices, tart cherries, dried rose petals and char aromas. Medium in body, it has polished acids and fine, muscular tannins that latch onto the finish."
US,91,26,Chardonnay,white,St. Innocent 2015 Freedom Hill Vineyard Dijon Clone Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Aged and fermented in neutral French oak, this luscious wine is smooth and open, with just the right touch of butter, presumably from partial malolactic fermentation. The mouthfeel is creamy and rich, like a peach cobbler, with a splash of butterscotch."
France,94,75,Chardonnay,white,Au Pied du Mont Chauve 2012 Les Chenevottes Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),"Structured and tight, this mineral-driven wine is still in its initial stages of development. It has crisp acidity, layers of spicy wood and a rich palate. Apples and white peach emerge from the firm, young structure. Drink this wine from 2018. The vineyard is next door to the Grand Cru Montrachet vines."
US,81,28,Pinot Grigio,white,Three Fox 2014 Calabrese Pinot Grigio (Middleburg),"Waxy lemon and pear aromas are muddled by bee pollen aromas. The palate is light and watery, driven by a plastic citrus flavor."
US,88,32,Sangiovese,red,La Folia Winery 2012 Sangiovese (Sierra Foothills),"This has a well-aged aroma plus tangy raspberry and cranberry flavors. It offers good balance between flavor, crispness and firm tannins. Most of all, it conveys a personality that mirrors this grape variety's Italian roots. It's dry, medium bodied and slightly astringent in texture."
US,92,38,Syrah,red,Frequency 2015 Mormann Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),"Plump blackberry and black currant meet with asphalt and dark chocolate on the nose of this bottling from a relatively new vineyard on Gypsy Canyon in the heart of the appellation. Dried violets, lavender, tart boysenberry, peppercorns and a hint of cardamom make for an exotic yet balanced palate."
US,87,35,Chardonnay,white,Firesteed 2014 Citation Chardonnay (Oregon),"Oaky and buttery all the way, this unabashedly old-fashioned Chardonnay will certainly appeal to those who love that style. It's a big chunky blocky wine, with simple, generic fruit awash in oak."
US,88,38,Chardonnay,white,Early Mountain 2016 Quaker Run Chardonnay (Virginia),"Lush aromas of pineapple and yellow apple ride over undertones of vanilla, coconut and butter on the nose. Concentrated flavors of pineapple, chamomile, vanilla and apple meld effortlessly on the palate. While the feel is round and silky, bright acidity keeps the balance. The finish is long and smooth."
US,93,85,Chardonnay,white,Bergström 2012 Sigrid Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Always in the top rank of Oregon Chardonnays, the Sigrid expresses itself with voluptuously ripe fruits, a generous mix of apples, peaches and pears. The barrel regimen holds nothing back either, sending a tsunami of baking spices, buttered nuts and toasted biscuit flavors across and through the palate."
Italy,86,90,Sangiovese,red,La Velona 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Oak, toast and scorched soil aromas lead the nose along with a whiff of dry underbrush. The assertive, robust palate shows dried cherry, licorice and the heat of evident alcohol alongside bracing tannins that leave an astringent finish. While the tannins need time, this lacks the fruit richness to stand up to lengthy aging."
Italy,87,20,Red Blend,red,Castello di Meleto 2011 Meleto  (Chianti Classico),"Aromas of blue flower and black berries lead the nose in this blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot/Alicante. The straightforward, linear palate shows black cherry and espresso alongside drying tannins."
US,91,30,Red Blend,red,Tres Sabores 2012 Por Que No? Red (Napa Valley),"Chocolaty, this fun blend of 56% Zinfandel, 31% Petite Sirah, 12% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Petit Verdot hails from estate, dry-farmed vineyards. Big, mountainous tannins soften in the glass to reveal juicy notes of dark and red cherry."
US,88,14,Chardonnay,white,Irony 2014 Small Lot Reserve Chardonnay (Monterey County),"Light in the glass, this solidly priced bottling shows light vanilla, caramel sea salt, squeezed lemon and white peach on the plump and approachable nose. The palate sizzles with the chalky energy of pink-grapefruit peels, with poached-apple flavors laced across pithy texture and a steely elegance."
Italy,91,18,Pinot Grigio,white,Volpe Pasini 2001 Ipso Pinot Grigio (Friuli Venezia Giulia),"This tremendous wine is 100% Pinot Grigio, of which 50% was aged in new wood. It is rich and full-bodied, with complex layers of vanilla. It comes from low-yielding, old vines. Only 8,000 bottles were produced."
US,89,54,Pinot Noir,red,Carabella 2010 Dijon 667 Clone Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This is a fine effort from first-year fruit that was cropped way down for extra concentration. It's a vibrant wine with a bright raspberry flavor that has a pretty, lightly candied quality."
US,85,29,Riesling,white,Chehalem 2014 Wind Ridge Block Riesling (Ribbon Ridge),"Oddly, among a nice selection of Chehalem Rieslings, this seems disjointed, with sour flavors and other components that don't quite knit together. Finished with a screwcap closure, there's no bad cork to point the finger at. Maybe more bottle age will help to pull it together."
US,84,24,Merlot,red,Northwest Cellars 2012 Cordon Grove Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Some good things are going on with this wine, including abundant red fruit and a soft feel. However the wood overpowers them with strong aromas and flavors of vanilla, dill and coconut along with a bitter note that distracts."
US,86,69,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cobblestone 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This soft, sweet, oaky Cabernet will appeal to those who like the New World style. It's as puffy as a dessert concoction, with cherry, chocolate, nougat and cinnamon spice flavors, and is ready to drink now."
US,87,55,Pinot Noir,red,Ideology 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Made in tiny quantities, this reserve-tier wine is smoky and robust in black cherry and vanilla flavors, supported by a density of oak."
Italy,88,12,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Sella & Mosca 1999 Le Arenarie Sauvignon Blanc (Sardinia),"A Sauvignon Blanc from Sardinia, and it’s a good one. One worries after the slightly reticent nose, but after that it’s all uphill. Well balanced, with crisp acidity and an expansive mouthfeel. Its predominantly melon finish goes on and on."
France,84,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Lapelletrie 1997  Saint-Émilion,"From a vintage known for its readily-approachable wines, this grand cru Saint-Emilion shows surprising structure. Some toasty oak frames delicate black-cherry fruit. Black tea notes on the finish carry more tannins than the fruit can handle in the long run, so catch this one soon before it heads south."
US,95,50,Chardonnay,white,Three Sticks 2014 Durell Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"Spicy acidity lies beneath the full-bodied richness of this wine, providing balance, freshness and a lightness on the palate that surprises. Meyer lemon, salty caramel and a feral overtone of forested woods combine effortlessly to intrigue and delight, showcasing the beauty that is Durell."
US,88,24,Merlot,red,Charles Krug 2008 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A lovely Merlot, softly tannic and rich, with oak-influenced herbs, cherries, blackberries and cassis. It's stongly flavored, but nuanced, with an elegant structure. Drink now."
France,88,68,Pinot Noir,red,Chanson Père et Fils 2009  Nuits-St.-Georges,"A foursquare, solid wine that shows its structure right up front. It is backed by red fruits and acids that lend a warm feeling. Full and dense, this needs to age."
US,87,12,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Geyser Peak 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"This wine is serious in style, starting with a dark color, then concentrated aromas like pomegranate juice, black olive and blackberry come through. It is full bodied and moderately tannic for the kind of dense texture that's great with meat and cheese."
Italy,90,33,Sangiovese,red,Nittardi 2012 Vigna Doghessa  (Chianti Classico),"You'll find aromas of ripe dark-skinned fruit, espresso, brown spice and sun-baked earth on this medium-bodied red. The palate delivers dried black cherry, blackberry licorice, coffee and ground black pepper set in a framework of packed, fine-grained tannins."
US,89,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Market Vineyards 2011 Derivative Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Merlot and Cabernet Franc. It leans slightly into the green, with aromas of fresh herbs mixed with vanilla, chocolate and other barrel spices. The palate is elegant, with a soft feel to the chocolate, cherry and barrel flavors."
US,90,36,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Andrew Murray 2013 Esperance Curtis Vineyard Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"The man who makes a million Syrahs dives into a blend of 60% Grenache, 25% Mourvèdre and 15% Syrah on this bottling, which offers composting lilac, black pepper, fresh boysenberry, dried herb and a tarry quality on the nose. There's a strong blackberry-balsamic reduction flavor once sipped, as well as beef char, elderberry and more tar."
US,89,11,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cupcake 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),"A screaming deal, this wine shows a nice blend of pencil lead, strawberries, peppercorn, oregano and chaparral scrub on the nose. The palate offers plenty of mocha and herbs including oregano and thyme, alongside elderberry and boysenberry fruit. It has enough tannic structure to notice but not enough to get in the way."
France,88,53,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Bellegrave du Poujeau 2006  Haut-Médoc,"Now maturing, this retains its red fruits; its bright texture and acidity go with the firm tannins and dark structure. It is balanced and ready to drink."
US,96,85,Pinot Noir,red,The Eyrie Vineyards 2012 Original Vines Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Separate from the other Original Vines bottling, this is part of the new single-vineyard series, and includes the famed South Block grapes. Lush and fragrant, full-bodied yet in the classic, elegant Eyrie tradition, this bursts with complexity. Bramble, cherries, strawberry preserves, coffee grounds and a hint of root beer come together in a deep, dense and thoroughly delicious wine."
France,86,25,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Perrin & Fils 2007 L'Andéol Rasteau Red (Côtes du Rhône Villages),"On the dusty, earthy side of the Rhône spectrum, with hints of cordite accenting cherry fruit. It's undeniably fresh and vibrant, just lacks some of the richness characteristic of the 2007 vintage."
France,87,19,Chardonnay,white,Pierre-Yves et Olivier Fichet 2016 Château London  (Mâcon),"This is a warm, rich wine. Its fruit is muted at this stage although there's potential in the good acidity and smooth, juicy texture. Let it open out more and drink from 2018."
France,90,30,Pinot Noir,red,Pierre André 2011  Savigny-lès-Beaune,"Rich as well as structured, it's ripe and already delicious. Berry and cherry fruits are nicely surrounded by both acidity and tannins. Full in the mouth, it's going to be an estimable wine. Drink from 2017."
France,90,60,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Haut Bellevue 2010  Moulis-en-Médoc,"Already the structure is beginning to make way for ripe plum and damson fruits. With its firm structure, this is a complex and concentrated wine that will need to age over at least four years."
France,94,69,Chardonnay,white,La Chablisienne 2014 Blanchot Grand Cru  (Chablis),"From the most southerly of the Grand Cru vineyards, this wine is firm and tightly structured. Its wood aging shows in its toasty, spicy character that will integrate as the wine ages. Its rich yellow fruit and taut acidity suggest it will taste best from from 2021."
France,87,15,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Cap Royal 2016  Bordeaux Blanc,"There is a touch of toastiness to this otherwise fruity wine, produced by Jean-René Matignon of Château Pichon Baron in Pauillac. It has class as well as attractive tangy acidity and a refreshing citrus backdrop. Drink now."
France,88,27,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Fournier Père et Fils 2016 Les Belles Vignes  (Sancerre),"A tightly structured wine, the entry-level Sancerre from this producer has density and concentration. It also has great fruit, a hint of green asparagus and swathes of lime and lemon balanced by acidity."
US,93,45,Pinot Noir,red,Les Voleurs 2012 Hurst Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"The wine is so pale in color, you could read a newspaper through the garnet hue. That suggests its silky and delicate texture. The flavors are classic Sonoma Coast, suggesting perfectly ripe raspberries and strawberries, persimmons and cola, with a rich jacket of smoky sandalwood. You can enjoy this lovely Pinot Noir now, and it will age interestingly through 2024."
US,88,17,Merlot,red,Barnard Griffin 2014 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The fruit is at the fore here, with aromas of blue fruit, wet stone and spice, along with a whiff of tire rubber. The palate has sweet fruit flavors with nubby tannins and a tart coffee-filled finish."
US,93,95,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Boeschen Vineyards 2013 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This small, estate-grown red from the eastern edge of St. Helena shows meticulous care taken both in the vineyard and cellar, with its remarkably soft, integrated tannin, especially in this warm, ripe vintage. Given just 2% Petit Verdot, it shines in black pepper, black cherry and a tiny suggestion of vanilla."
US,87,30,Pinot Noir,red,Duck Pond 2005 Jory Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This Pinot Noir, named for a particular soil type in the Willamette valley, is scented strongly of the lumber smell you get at a building supplies store. There is a simple but pleasing layer of strawberry/raspberry fruit hidden in the wine's core. Perhaps a year or two of bottle age will pull things together."
France,94,50,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine Bernard Fleuriet et Fils 2015 Pur Jus  (Sancerre),"This wine has no added sulfur, giving crisp, clear and clean fruitiness. It also adds an light touch of oxidation that broadens the wine and makes the white stone fruit richer. Drink this impressively ripe wine from 2018."
France,88,10,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Auguste 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur,Juicy red fruit dominates this wine. It has some firm tannins underneath—just enough to support the delicious raspberry and red-currant flavors. It is maturing well and will be ready to drink from 2017.
US,88,30,Chardonnay,white,Sante Arcangeli 2014 Pelio Vineyard Chardonnay (Monterey),"From vines that sit at 1,000 feet overlooking Monterey and the Carmel Valley, this wine only went through partial malolactic fermentation. It shows a tight nose of lemon-laced sour cream and grapefruit blossoms. Lime peels, more sour cream and stronger grapefruit-pith flavors mark the tight, tart palate that has firmness that will mellow with age."
US,89,30,Merlot,red,Colter's Creek 2012 Colter's Creek Vineyard Merlot (Idaho),"The raspberry aromas are bright and jammy. The flavors are sumptuous yet elegant, going down easy."
US,86,25,Red Blend,red,Juxtapoz 2012 Red (North Coast),"Smooth and fruity, sleek and spicy, it oozes sweet cherry and strawberry flavors. Feeling silky for all its ripeness, it has just a touch of tannin to help the finish linger. It's made from Syrah, Zinfandel and three other varieties."
US,89,20,White Blend,white,Tenshen 2015 White (Central Coast),"Expertly light touches of banana, honey, pecan, tuberose and citrus peel show on the nose of this blend by Joey Tensley and Alex Guarachi. There is great energy and tension to the sip, with yellow-grapefruit-juice flavors. Crisp, this would be a great shellfish pairing."
France,90,60,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château de la Brède 2011 Cuvée Montesquieu  (Graves),"French philosopher and writer Charles-Louis de Montesquieu once lived at the moated Château de la Brède, hence the name of this wine. It is a ripe, finely perfumed wine, with new wood and eucalyptus aromas, rich red fruits and a soft, open series of tannins. It is almost ready to drink, but the chocolate edge suggests it should be kept until 2017."
France,87,17,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château de Lisennes 2015  Bordeaux,"Ripe fruit, firm tannins and acidity are showing the potential of this wine. With its blackberry flavors and attractive light tannins, this one should be ready to drink soon, certainly by early 2018."
US,89,19,Red Blend,red,Beresan 2010 The Buzz Yellow Jacket Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon are the principal components, with smaller amounts of Cab Franc and Merlot, all from one of the estate vineyards located in the Rocks (Walla Walla's soon-to-be newest sub-AVA). Strongly tannic, its core of cassis fruit is anchored in potent flavors of iron, earth and licorice."
US,87,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Faust 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Lots of ripe blackberry, currant, toasty oak and spice flavors shine in this dry, tannic young Cabernet. Small proportions of Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc add complexity to the blend. Drink it over the next few years."
US,88,17,Zinfandel,red,Sebastiani 2012 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"A well-priced, higher production Zin with smaller amounts of Petite Sirah, Syrah, Malbec and Alicante Bouschet, this features plenty of ripe black and red berry fruit leveled by restrained, dusty tannins. Smooth and well crafted, it makes for a good house wine."
Italy,88,20,Pinot Grigio,white,Conti Formentini 2011 Pinot Grigio (Collio),"Satisfying freshness makes this northern Italian Pinot Grigio perfect for salad lunches or smoked salmon. There's a bright personality here with vibrant tones of citrus, green grass and Granny Smith apple."
US,88,21,Riesling,white,Château Frank NV Célèbre Crémant Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Whiffs of lemon and lime zest lend verve to waxy white-floral notes on this honey-touched Riesling sparkling. Juicy and a touch sweet with ripe stone-fruit flavors, it's elegantly balanced with a streak of high-pitched acid and soft, delicate bubbles."
Italy,91,20,Riesling,white,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2012 Montiggl Riesling (Alto Adige),"This dry Riesling boasts intense apricot, yellow peach, citrus and smoky mineral sensations. The rich but polished palate is restrained by crisp acidity that leaves the mouth feeling fresh and clean."
US,87,110,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Nice 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is very rich in blackberries and currants, bearing lots of oak that adds caramelized toastiness. While the tannins are thick and fine, there's something rustic on the finish in the form of extracted, candied sweetness and heat. Flashy as it is, you're best drinking this wine now."
US,83,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Field Stone 2008 Wally's Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"This is a raisiny Cabernet, tannic and slightly coarse. Drink it now with barbecue or beef stews."
US,94,65,Pinot Noir,red,Three Sticks 2012 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Succulent and juicy in velvety waves of black-cherry cola, this is a delicious expression of Durell, with intriguing teases of truffle, black tea and forest floor. Concentrated and full bodied, it offers additional seasonings of cinnamon and black pepper, which persist through a long finish. Enjoyable now, this wine is structured to cellar through 2020."
US,91,26,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Gordon Estate 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is the finest Cabernet from Gordon Estate in some time; forward and pretty, with a juicy mix of red fruits. The raspberry and cherry and currant flavors are nicely defined and deep, underscored with crisp acidity, and showing the sort of youthful concentration that suggests further cellaring is in order. Nonetheless, it's a wine to enjoy right away simply for its luscious, exuberant fruit."
US,90,32,Pinot Noir,red,Tamayo Family 2006 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"A rich, complex Pinot that shows the intricacies of Santa Lucia Pinot Noir yet retains an immediate drinkability for its silky fruit forwardness. Dry and crisp, the flavors of cherries, currants, cola, vanilla and smoky oak finish with a clean spiciness."
Italy,88,18,Chardonnay,white,Baglio del Cristo di Campobello 2008 Adènzia Chardonnay (Sicilia),"Adènzia is a Chardonnay-based wine with 13% Grillo grown in white, chalky Sicilian soils that offers a drying mineral note behind fresh aromas of spring flowers and exotic fruit. The wine is crisp and pristine but also has the natural heft to pair with delicious fish dishes."
France,85,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Grand Bourgeau 2015  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"Dense and dry, this is a tough, extracted wine. It has a hard edge followed by juicy acidity and will probably remain on the dry side."
US,87,14,Chardonnay,white,Keuka Spring 2009 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Judicious use of oak makes Keuka Spring stand out in a line-up of Finger Lakes Chards. Subtle on the nose with whiffs of fresh apple and toasted hazelnuts, the wine's palate is quite full with luscious sweet melon, vanilla and cream. Hints of smoke and burnt sugar add a dimension of darkness to the finish."
US,92,40,Syrah,red,Waters 2006 Loess Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This Loess is definitely more—more concentration, more ripeness, more Côte Rôtie character than the 2005, but already showing dramatic flavor development. Cofermented with 3% Viognier, it's a silky wine with flavors of blood, meat and earth dominating. Tannins are ripe, and it was barreled in second-fill oak, preserving the natural flavors of the vineyard. Clearly the best so far from Waters."
US,89,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Januik 2014 Weinbau Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Wahluke Slope),"This wine's aromas suggest woodspice, herb, parsley, cherry and smoke. Its cherry and coffee flavors are light in style and cut short on the finish."
US,83,12,Chardonnay,white,Edna Valley Vineyard 2008 Paragon Chardonnay (San Luis Obispo County),"Simple and sugary sweet, with peach, pineapple and mango flavors that taste like a supermarket fruit juice. It's okay for an everyday Chard."
US,83,20,Chardonnay,white,Simple Math Cellars 2008 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"Not much going on with this dry, crisp Chardonnay. It has watery flavors of citrus fruits and apricots, with a hint of oak."
US,88,28,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Wente 2005 Charles Wetmore Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"Pretty straightforward Cabernet, done well and blended with bits of Petit Verdot and Merlot. Vanilla, tobacco and cassis aromas mark the nose, while the flavors are similar, but with a slightly plummy edge. Soft and supple on the finish, there's no need to cellar this wine."
US,92,47,Pinot Noir,red,Schermeister 2012 Paladini Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"From the Napa side of Carneros, this small-production Pinot is concentrated and oaky, layered throughout in spicy black cherry tart. The strong flavors lead to a strong, emphatic finish."
US,91,95,Merlot,red,Jarvis 2012 Estate Grown Cave Fermented Merlot (Napa Valley),"Enviable structure marks this lovely wine that appears to have been made in a slightly reductive style. Light oak, a bouquet of dried herb and vanilla ride along a medium-bodied texture that's soft and silky, with a panache of juicy blackberry and currant on the finish."
US,87,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Windsor Sonoma 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"A very nice wine for the price. It's bone dry and high in acidity, with a crisp tartness that's just what you want in Sauvignon Blanc. The flavors are pleasant, of oranges, citrons, limes and green apples."
US,88,18,Zinfandel,red,Big Smooth 2014 Zinfandel (Lodi),"Nicely balanced for dinner time, this dry wine is not too fat and not too lean, but just right. It has raspberry aromas, fresh berry flavors and a touch of fine tannin to add grip to the texture."
Italy,87,30,Pinot Grigio,white,Franz Haas 2014 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),"Yellow wildflower and peach aromas follow through to the fresh, linear palate along with a nectarine note. It's zesty and balanced, with crisp acidity."
France,94,145,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Faiveley 2014 Les Cazetiers Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),"This wine is already well balanced. Ripe strawberries and red cherries are shot through with the acidity of the vintage. The tannins are present, complementing the already attractive fruits. The aftertaste shows the considerable potential with its tannins. Drink from 2020."
France,90,28,White Blend,white,Yves Leccia 2015 YL Blanc White (Ile de Beauté),"Dominated by Vermentinu, this is a rich while crisp wine. With its fresh apple flavors and good acidity, it is deliciously perfumed, ripe and poised with a strong line in minerality. Drink from 2017."
US,89,56,Syrah,red,Sparkman 2010 Darkness Syrah (Yakima Valley),"There's a whiff of garrigue in this wine, scents and flavors of stem and herb and brambly berry. The acids are plentiful and bring notes of citrus threaded through the finish."
France,85,51,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Bellegrave du Poujeau 2007  Haut-Médoc,"With red berry fruitiness, this is an attractive wine. It has a light texture, some juicy acidity and it's ready to drink."
US,93,105,Pinot Noir,red,Adelsheim 2012 Nicholas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Framed beautifully with scents and flavors of toasted hazelnut (the property was orginally a walnut, hazelnut and plum orchard), this builds its substantial core around deep black cherry fruit. The density and length are impressive, and though delicious already, it will surely gain in complexity with further aging. Drink now through 2025."
US,86,65,Pinot Noir,red,Fogline Vineyards 2013 Fogline Neighbors Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"With a handsome percentage of whole-cluster fermentation in the mix, this wine shows a funky undercurrent of marshmallow and mushroom. It never quite finds its voice amid a light-bodied texture and disjointed body."
US,88,35,Pinot Noir,red,Amity Vineyards 2008 Crannell Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The 2008 Crannell leans to the herbaceous side of Oregon Pinot Noir, relatively low in listed alcohol (13%). Cranberry is the dominant fruit flavor, along with fresh herbs and whiffs of tomato leaf."
France,90,19,Riesling,white,Lucien Albrecht 2015 Réserve Riesling (Alsace),"Slightly bruised apple on nose and palate also becomes apparent on the textured, balanced palate of this wine that aligns citric freshness with more mellow and sonorous tones of ripeness. The finish is dry and whistle-clean."
US,89,34,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Sculpterra 2014 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Boisterous blueberry, black cherry and black-currant aromas make for a hedonistic nose on this bottling that also offers a sultry line of cocoa, espresso and clove spice. The palate shows similar layering, from black-cherry compote to herbs to black olives, proving unique overall."
US,88,20,Merlot,red,Wellington 2012 Merlot (Sonoma County),"This is a lushly concentrated, likable wine, soft in tannin and subtle in oak, with strong layers of black plum, berry and espresso."
US,83,10,Merlot,red,Glen Ellen 2010 Proprietor's Reserve Merlot (California),"Simple and green, with mint, tobacco and cherry flavors. It's a sound, clean wine. Even though the fruit isn't exactly concentrated, it's an easy wine to drink at parties."
Italy,86,17,Pinot Grigio,white,Plozner 2006 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Grave),There's a distinctive herbal and mineral linearity to this white that is accented by tones of kiwi and passion fruit. Offers a sharp point of spicy acidity and just enough structure to broaden its appeal in the mouth. Closed with a glass cork.
US,90,66,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Chimney Rock 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"Marked by hefty tannins, this Cabernet is a little too astringent to drink now. With blackberry, currant and mineral flavors, it should develop for a while, but it could go downhill quickly, so it's a gamble. Production was 13,500 cases."
US,92,70,Pinot Noir,red,Bergström 2015 Silice Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Formerly the deLancellotti vineyard, Silice brings fresh, supple flavors of bright raspberry and cherry fruit. A distinctive ashy stone note forms the bassline, holding the finish firm. It should benefit from another year of bottle age. Or give it a long decant to enjoy now."
US,92,35,Chardonnay,white,Darcie Kent Vineyards 2013 Hoffman Vineyard Chardonnay (Livermore Valley),"Each sip of this graceful wine brings a little more depth and flavor. The aromas at first are quiet with just a hint of butter and toasted baguette, but on the palate it's easy to enjoy the pear-tart flavors and creamy texture. Everything seems to build toward the finish, which is long and luxurious."
US,84,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Frog's Leap 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),"This unoaked Sauvignon Blanc is crisply acidic, with honey-infused lemon, lime and pink grapefruit flavors. It has an edge of acrid gooseberries that some people will find troublesome, while others will compare it favorably to New Zealand wines."
US,87,27,White Blend,white,Macari 2013 Dos Aguas White (North Fork of Long Island),"Zesty and fragrant with notes of grapefruit and citrus blossom, this is an endlessly quaffable white with wide appeal. Juicy and fresh with a focused edge of acidity, it finishes briskly with just a touch of minerality."
US,90,35,Pinot Gris,white,Aubichon Cellars 2015 Reserve Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),This barrel-fermented wine has an aggressive toasty aroma that carries over into the flavors. Its ripe apple and buttered toast notes lead to a finish accented with coconut. A Chardonnay lover's Pinot Gris.
Italy,93,100,Red Blend,red,Fattoria Le Pupille 2012 Saffredi  (Maremma Toscana),"Structured and elegant, this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 10% Petit Verdot offers aromas of blackberry, red currant, blue flowers, clove and oak. The concentrate palate doles out black cherry, plum, sage, anise and tobacco alongside a backbone of fine-grained tannins. Drink 2016–2022."
US,87,48,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Merry Cellars 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas of freshly cut wood, pickling spices, vanilla dark cherry lead to plentiful black-fruit flavors, supported by lightly astringent tannins. There are good things underneath but the wood gets in the way."
US,88,25,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Peju 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Stainless-steel fermented and aged in neutral oak, this wine threads the line between grassy wet stone and fresh-squeezed grapefruit, offering dry refreshing acidity. Light bodied, it provides just enough oomph to hold its own at the table."
France,89,29,Riesling,white,Domaine Pfister 2014 Tradition Riesling (Alsace),"Notes of stone and smoke join lemon and green apple on the nose of this wine. The palate has an earthier aspect but is bracingly fresh and precise with pure lemon zestiness. Dry and slender, the wine will round out with some bottle age. Drink 2018–2023."
Italy,86,20,Red Blend,red,Corte Archi 2010 Gli Archi  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),"This is an extracted wine that has very ripe aromas of prune and raisin, along with a hint of burned rubber. The palate shows blackberry, fig, spice and licorice flavors, along with a hint of orange peel and a warm midpalate. A bit one-dimensional, but enjoyable."
US,88,20,Chardonnay,white,Cherry Tart 2014 Chardonnay (California),"Big and flavorful, this full-bodied wine boasts butter, toast and smoke nuances layered over ripe pear and marzipan flavors. Fermented in stainless steel but aged in French oak, it has a rich texture and overt sweetness without going to extremes."
France,86,13,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Bois de Favereau 2011 Cuvée Jean-Jules  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"Ripe and fruity, this is an attractive wine. It has a rich, spicy character from wood aging. It has a friendly, open character, making it ready to drink now."
US,83,7,White Blend,white,Covey Run 1998 White (Columbia Valley (WA)),Citrus fruits and figs are backed with a healthy dose of acidity in this somewhat tart offering.
US,88,53,Pinot Noir,red,Dutton Estate 2014 Jewell Block Vineyard Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This vineyard site, like many others in Green Valley, was once planted to Gravenstein apples. That heritage persists in this wine's tartness that highlights an earthiness of sassafras, pomegranate and even citrus, bright elements atop a velvety-smooth texture."
France,92,110,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Faiveley 2010 Les Cazetiers Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),"This is rich, showing the full-bodied character of a Gevrey-Chambertin Premier Cru. It has a sense of gravity and structure, with a flavor of red-plum jelly. Solid and chunky, this already expresses its fruit, although it does need at least six years to mature."
US,87,15,Riesling,white,Firestone 2014 Riesling (Santa Ynez Valley),"Fresh orange blossoms and jasmine spring from a chalky backbone on the nose of this clean and crisp semisweet bottling that also shows tangerine pith, lemon-lime soda and a touch of quinine. Though a bit sweet on the sip, it is far from cloying and remains refreshing throughout."
US,87,15,Chardonnay,white,RouteStock 2009 Route 121 Chardonnay (Carneros),"The apricot and pear flavors are obviously very ripe, but they're balanced by brisk acidity, and a certain stong minerality you often find in Carneros Chardonnays. Oak plays its part. A bit obvious, but for the price, there's plenty of opulence."
US,90,34,Syrah,red,Shane Wines 2012 The Villain Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"From a former Kosta Browne winemaker comes this very dark Syrah, which shows still-wound-up aromas of elderberry, black coffee, white pepper and a touch of game. There are rich soy and beef notes once sipped, packaged by dense tannins and zesty acidity, with more elderberry, beef char and crushed slate emerging with time. Still young."
US,88,35,Zinfandel,red,Ravenswood 2012 Teldeschi Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A field-inspired blend of 80% Zinfandel with 12% Carignane and 12% Petite Sirah, this wine holds red jammy fruit at its core. Medium to full-bodied in weight, it has fine tannins that give silkiness to offset the wine's sizable power."
US,89,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Riboli 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A very fine Cabernet, blended with some Petit Verdot which seems to add body and perfume, but it's quite young, and needs some time to resolve its issues. Right now the tannins, dusty as they are, dominate, and the blackberry and cherry flavors are all jam. Should develop healthily for 6–8 years."
US,91,95,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cliff Lede 2011 Moondance Dream Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"The winery's Poetry Vineyard names its blocks for famous rock songs, this one a combination of Van Morrison's “Moondance” and Aerosmith's “Dream On.” The resulting wine, mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller portions of Petit Verdot, Malbec and Merlot, is elegant in earthy cinnamon and clove followed by currant and black cherry, with a spiciness to the taste. The finish all savory, smoky oak."
Italy,85,23,Red Blend,red,La Cignozza 2009 Riserva  (Chianti),"Aromas of tilled earth, leather, ripe black-skinned fruit and a gamey note set the stage for this funky wine. The overripe palate displays fleshy black plum, dried blue flowers and bitter barnyard sensations set against a backdrop of soft acidity. Drying, astringent tannins cut the finish short."
US,85,60,Pinot Noir,red,Bouchaine 2013 Bacchus Collection Terraces Estate Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This is a dry, tannic estate wine that's rich and ripe with a leathery aspect of gun smoke and blackberry. It shows more in the way of black fruit and spicy pepper than fruit that's delicate or crisp."
France,91,32,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine Roger & Christophe Moreux 2016 Les Bouffants  (Sancerre),"The wine is ripe, soft and generous. It has a fine balance between spice and rich white and green fruits. Lightly structured with a herbal edge and with pepper, it is still young. Drink this fine wine from 2018"
Italy,89,18,White Blend,white,Gini 2001 La Froscà  (Soave Classico),"From a single vineyard, this exemplary Soave has great intensity and concentration, with flavors of peppers and ripe, green fruits. The wine's long fermentation wine gives it structure and great extraction of flavor."
US,95,120,Syrah,red,Horsepower 2013 Sur Echalas Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This wine opens with aromas of earthy funk, steak tartare, potpourri, pepper and earth, showing outrageously minerality. The flavors are dense and textured, leaning hard into the savory with abundant flower and fire pit notes that linger effortlessly. It's a very cerebral wine but with no shortage of hedonism."
US,88,13,Pinot Gris,white,Waterbrook 2008 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Bold and fruity, this runs through a spectrum from tart lemon to ripe pineapple to hints of something riper and sweeter, like banana or papaya. A good alternative to Chardonnay for those who favor fruit over oak."
Italy,90,75,Red Blend,red,Nanni Copè 2012 Sabbie di Sopra il Bosco Red (Terre del Volturno),"Made from native grape Pallagrello Nero along with 5% Aglianico and 5% Casavecchia, this robust wine opens with aromas of black fruit, earth, game, leather and black spice. The dense palate delivers rich blackberry, black cherry and black pepper, with robust tannins and a solid acidic backbone. Drink after 2016."
US,89,18,Sangiovese,red,Trio Vintners 2007 Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A very pretty effort, the wine's strawberry and rhubarb flavors are balanced against spring herbs and hints of leaf. The Morrison Lane Sangiovese is blended with 15% Syrah from the Boushey vineyard."
Italy,90,29,Sangiovese,red,Avignonesi 2012  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,"Aromas of forest floor, violet, red berry and a whiff of dark baking spice unfold in the glass while wild cherry, black raspberry, ground pepper and star anise drive the palate. Framed in firm, fine-grained tannins, this is a classic Tuscan red. Drink through 2020."
US,87,25,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Mayacamas 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Mount Veeder),"Good acidity gives this Sauvignon Blanc a nice crispness. The flavors are of limes and green apples, with a stony minerality. It's an elegant wine, with a touch of wood. A little tough at first, it grows in charm in the glass."
US,86,55,Pinot Noir,red,Longoria 2011 Fe Ciega Vineyard Block M Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Lean and minty. Despite a certain elegance, this Pinot lacks the voluptuous richness you want in a wine of this price. The chilly vintage seems to have taken its toll. There's some good cherry and currant fruit, but the wine falls short. Drink up."
France,89,16,Pinot Gris,white,Koenig 2015 Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Fresh pear notes and a touch of white blossom appear on the nose. The palate is rounded with fruit and a touch of flavor-boosting residual sweetness. This is easy but generous, full of ripe pear fruit."
US,92,25,Pinot Noir,red,Ancestrale 2016 Pet Nat Method Ancestral Bassi Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"Mike Sinor's pet-nat experiment scored big in 2016. This pink sparkler offers complex yeasty bread, crushed rock and turned clay aromas. Zingy and racy, it grabs hold of the palate. It's all about fascinating texture and refreshing acidity."
US,93,100,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Paul Hobbs 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Paul Hobbs coaxes beautifully classic Cab aromas and textures from this wine, which comes from the tricky 2011 vintage. Expect black currant, olive, cassis and peppercorn to intermingle on the palate amidst soft elegance, the perfect balance between fruity and herbal. On the finish a dusting of mocha turns up the dial on deliciousness."
US,86,15,White Blend,white,Whitecliff Vineyard NV Awosting White (Hudson River Region),This fruity forward wine boasts punchy tangerine and lemon flavors with a tart melon-rind edge. It's a touch herbaceous and dusty but finishes brisk and clean.
France,87,10,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château de la Bouyère 2010  Bordeaux,"This is a fruity wine, and its black currant flavor emerging right away. Next comes the bright acidity, while the tannins form a solid, dark and dry contrast. The wine needs at least two years to soften into something rich."
US,86,14,Chardonnay,white,Old Soul 2016 Chardonnay (Lodi),This is a good no-nonsense wine that emphasizes fresh lemon and apple flavors and adds in light oaky elements. It's medium bodied and the texture balances crispness with a touch of buttery richness.
US,92,100,Red Blend,red,Krupp Brothers 2012 The Doctor Red (Napa Valley),"This unusual blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Malbec comes from the folks who own Stagecoach Vineyard high atop Atlas Peak. A bombastically dense and concentrated wine, it's gamy, meaty and brawny all around. Black fruit, tar and tobacco combine to full-bodied effect. It would be best to wait on this one, cellaring through 2020."
US,91,22,Syrah,red,Bergevin Lane 2008 She-Devil Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The best value among all of Bergevin Lane's 2008 Syrahs, this rich and smoky effort spent 20 months in oak. Sourced from Stone Tree and Francisca's vineyards, it has tight, ripe berry flavors and beautifully manicured tannins."
US,89,38,Zinfandel,red,Benessere 2006 BK Collins Old Vines Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Spicy and briary, suggesting wild forest berries, nettles, chamomile, bitter greens and black pepper. Drink this exotically dry, tannic wine with roast lamb prepared with garlic and rosemary."
US,95,56,Pinot Noir,red,Williams Selyem 2009 Flax Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A sip is all it takes to fall in love with this potent Pinot Noir. Big tannins and crisp acidity make it hard to appreciate now, but there's a gigantic core of cherries and raspberries, with a firm minerality from the soil. Will develop bottle complexity over the years. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2015."
US,92,75,Chardonnay,white,ZD 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros),"Winemaker Chris Pisani used small American oak barrels to age this well-made, generous wine, which opens in a sweetness of vanilla bean, grilled peach and toasted oak. Richness and concentration make friends with a decent level of minerality and plenty of length, the wine made in a full-bodied style."
US,90,19,Chardonnay,white,Fleur 2014 Chardonnay (Carneros),"This wine has a high-toned richness that presents as clean and linear. Briny olive notes define the opening aroma, while more developed pear, apple and peach flavors fill out the palate."
US,88,27,Merlot,red,Vanderbilt 2013 Reserve Merlot (Dry Creek Valley),"A mild current of cinnamon, clove and tobacco provide a spicy entry into this wine, backed up by a fruity mid-palate. Medium weight and body give it some power and substance, while on the finish, it comes under an herbaceous light."
Italy,92,86,Sangiovese,red,Corte dei Venti 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Spicy and full-bodied, this opens with aromas that suggest sunbaked earth, leafy underbrush, baking spice and a whiff of leather. The smooth, chewy palate doles out ripe Morello cherry, fig, cinnamon, tobacco and star anise alongside solid, velvety tannins. It's already surprisingly approachable and offers fine near- and mid-term enjoyment. Drink 2017–2025."
US,87,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Darcie Kent Vineyards 2009 Rava Blackjack Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey),"Good citrus fruit flavors, along the lines of grapefruits, limes and Meyer lemons, accompanied by zesty acidity mark this bone-dry Sauvignon Blanc. It really scours the mouth clean. Very nice with puff pastry mushroom appetizers, bruschetta with goat cheese and roasted red peppers, or crudités with a garlicky sour cream dip."
Italy,92,95,Red Blend,red,Brunelli 2011 Campo dei Titari Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"Aromas of resin, spiced plum, blue flower and a whiff of pipe tobacco float out of the glass. The smooth brawny palate presents dried black cherry, prune, vanilla, mocha and cinnamon framed in firm, velvety tannins. Drink 2018–2016."
US,94,48,Pinot Noir,red,August West 2015 Graham Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Concentrated cherry and plum aromas meet with iron, cinnamon and gingersnap on the nose of this single-vineyard wine. The flavors surpass the aromas in succulence—star anise, nutmeg and bay leaf seemingly wrapped in buttered pastry."
US,95,155,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Robert Mondavi 2013 To Kalon Vineyard 50th Anniversary Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"A wine marking the 50th anniversary of Robert Mondavi Winery's founding, this shows the grandeur of the man, the vineyard and the vintage. Full bodied and robust, it's intense in bark, tar and black licorice, with dottings of coconut. Aromatically inviting, it's dusty and soft, with acres of complexity and structure. Enjoy it in 2023 and beyond."
US,90,25,Chardonnay,white,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2006 Cold Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The Cold Creek Chardonnay is built upon 30-year-old vines, fully ripened at this warm site. Sensuous, soft and broadly laced with flavors of toasted nuts, brioche and apple pie, this luxurious Chardonnay still maintains a pleasing, focused structure that carries along flavors of lemon and apple, cut against the dominant oak. Cold Creek wines are among Washington's most ageworthy."
US,89,16,Chardonnay,white,RouteStock 2012 Route 121 Chardonnay (Carneros),"Apple and fig are layered throughout this elegant, medium-bodied wine that offers the ripeness of a warm vintage without veering into sweetness. The barrel impact is managed well, adding to the impact of honey and dried nuts on the finish."
US,87,13,Riesling,white,Lucas Vineyards 2012 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Stony mineral notes lend a stately feel to this off-dry Riesling bursting with ripe peach, tangerine and quince flavors. It's brisk and bright on the palate with a lingering finish of lime and lemon zest."
US,83,26,Merlot,red,Tedeschi Family 2012 Stargazer Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"This is a 100% varietal wine, with a dullness to the nose and a simplicity to the palate that makes it hard to distinguish, the fruit and acidity diluted."
France,92,69,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils 2014 Vaillon Premier Cru Cuvée Guy Moreau  (Chablis),"Planted by Guy Moreau in 1934, the vines for this wine are now over 70 years old. This vintage is richly endowed, layering delicious wood spice and yellow fruit flavors over crisp, citrusy acidity. It's firmly textured with a mineral edge, finishing with concentration. Drink from 2020."
US,88,34,Pinot Noir,red,MacRostie 2014 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine combines fruit from several notable vineyards, including Goldrock Ridge, Thale's Estate and Wildcat Mountain. Together, they drive a focused expression of smoky dark fruit and tart, moderate acidity. The fruit shows a depth of ripeness that's intense, with a finish of spicy black tea."
US,88,27,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Zoetic Wines 2014 Complesso Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Blended with 5% Viognier and aged in a combination of new French oak, neutral oak and stainless steel, this is a full-bodied white that offers a wealth of ripe peach, apricot and key lime flavor."
US,89,22,Pinot Grigio,white,Seghesio 2011 Pinot Grigio (Sonoma County),"Pinot Grigio can be made in almost any style, but Seghesio nails the dry, elegant approach. This is a terrific wine, mouthwateringly tart, and the lime flavor is satisfying. Unoaked, this is so versatile, you can drink it with almost anything calling for a dry white, or all by itself as an apéritif."
France,90,60,Chardonnay,white,Christophe Cordier 2013 Vieilles Vignes  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"A wine with great fruit and balance, this is totally ready to drink. Harmony between the juicy acidity and yellow fruits gives the wine richness, intensity and an intensely fresh aftertaste."
France,92,30,Riesling,white,Domaine Charles Baur 2012 Eichberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"A truly aromatic Riesling that has a wonderful series of fruit and spice perfumes. It's ripe and full in the mouth, offering a strongly mineral edge as well as rich apple and citrus. Textured and still very tangy, the complex wine needs to age, so drink from 2017."
US,89,29,Pinot Noir,red,Schultz 2014 Freedom Stand Sure Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Strawberry fruit defines this open, broad-flavored wine. The palate is smooth in feel and carries accessible red-fruit flavors that offer immediate appeal."
US,88,42,White Blend,white,Chimney Rock 2007 Elevage Blanc White (Napa Valley),"A white Bordeaux-style wine based on Sauvignon Blanc, it shows upfront citrusy flavors of pineapples and limes, enriched with the vanilla and smoke of oak. Could be a little drier and more complex, but pretty good."
US,93,56,Pinot Noir,red,Testarossa 2007 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This is a big, kick-butt wine that shows the powerful fruit and hard tannins that make Pinots from this vineyard ageable. You'll find it tough and gritty now, with rich, deep flavors of cherries, currants, cola and cedar. Best beyond 2011."
US,86,20,Sangiovese,red,Balverne 2012 Forever Wild Rosé of Sangiovese (Chalk Hill),"Lots of ripe raspberries, persimmons and vanilla in this fairly dark blush wine, along with notes of tobacco and cinnamon. The finish is sweet, suggesting pairing with charcuterie and goat cheese."
US,88,16,Chardonnay,white,Bianchi 2012 El Camino Vineyard Signature Selection Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"There's a little oak on this Chard, but you can hardly detect it. The flavors are all about ripe pineapples, oranges, peaches and apricots, accented by crisp acidity. A fine example of coastal California Chardonnay, it will marry well with grilled salmon."
US,91,45,Pinot Noir,red,Carlton Hill 2010 Pinot Noir,"Spicy, with a hint of mint, this deftly integrated, late-release wine brings rhubarb and raspberry fruit into place. There's enough acidity to complement a nice, fatty piece of salmon, with a light streak of dried herbs running through the finish. It's drinking well, at or near its peak."
US,86,10,Riesling,white,Lucas Vineyards 2002 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Slightly floral on the nose, with some pear and nectarine as well, this light-bodied wine blends sweet stone-fruit flavors with tart green apples on the palate, giving it a degree of balance."
Italy,92,36,Red Blend,red,Salcheto 2010 Riserva  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"Aromas of black plum, cake spice and hints of leather and tilled earth lead the nose. The spicy palate combines elegance and structure, offering black cherry, vanilla, mocha and white pepper alongside firm but fine-grained tannins. Drink 2016–2022."
US,89,42,Syrah,red,Meyer Family Cellars 2012 High Ground Syrah (Yorkville Highlands),"This nicely dry, not-too-big wine smells like turned earth and new leather, tastes rather tart and berrylike, and feels lean and moderately tannic in texture. Those who like their wines on the taut side will love it."
US,87,18,Riesling,white,Glenora 2011 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Hints of sea salt and crushed stone add layers of minerality to this Riesling that's just a shade off-dry. The palate is concentrated with notes of tangerine juice, lemon peel and pressed apples, balanced by puckery lemon acidity."
US,82,25,Pinot Grigio,white,Black Box 2014 Pinot Grigio (California),"Unusually dry and tangy, this light-bodied wine smells like celery and herbs, and tastes very lean and straightforward."
US,87,10,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Fetzer 2013 Valley Oaks Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"There's absolutely nothing wrong with this very affordable, concentrated and trimly built wine. Earth and sage aromas lead to bright black cherry and plum flavors, with a typically firm texture for the varietal."
US,87,18,Pinot Noir,red,Jezebel 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"A smoky nose carries a strong suggestion of bacon fat, wrapped around tightly wound blackberry fruit. Flavors play out broadly and thin out quickly, but this young wine offers solid value and immediate pleasure."
US,87,60,Chardonnay,white,Hirsch 2013 Estate Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),A vibrant yellow-gold color and a good blend of delicate citrus and butter in the aroma and flavor give this understated and medium-bodied wine the balance and interest to satisfy.
US,91,54,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hanna 2007 Bismark Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Dark, spicy and deeply flavored, this Cabernet is dense and concentrated in blackberry and cassis flavors, with a stony minerality at its core. The fruit is so ripely expansive, it tastes sweet on the finish, yet the wine is utterly dry. It's good now despite the hard mountain tannins, but should begin to blossom after 2014."
US,91,64,Pinot Noir,red,Foxen 2013 Melville Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Surprisingly shy in aromas at first, this eventually releases pleasing elements of mace, nutmeg, star anise and red cherry. The palate is softly lush and earthy, with black rocks, heavy black plum, hoisin sauce, boysenberry and a cola character. With quite strong structure, this will smooth and grow more delicious with time. Drink 2018–2028."
US,86,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Hanna 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"With ammonia, green pea, gooseberry and pink grapefruit flavors, it defines a grapy, dry, acidic style. Tasted in January, the wine was still a little bubbly from the fermentation process."
US,87,26,Merlot,red,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2011 Canoe Ridge Estate Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills),"Though the oak is high quality (62% new American and French), it's in your face on this 100% varietal wine, with notes of char and toast. It's soft, silky and elegant in feel but the barrel flavors take over making it hard to get all the fruit notes."
US,91,42,Pinot Noir,red,Ghost Hill 2014 Bayliss-Bower Vineyard Pinot Noir,"This substantial, powerfully styled Pinot Noir is layered with tart, punchy red fruit. That rich core is laced with brown sugar, coffee, caramel and cola streaks. It was aged in 10% new French oak."
Italy,90,20,Red Blend,red,Tenuta San Vito 2005 Madiere Red (Toscana),"This happy blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet and Merlot delivers delicate blueberry nuances and warm toast. It's a wine that flows over the palate, leaving it clean and refreshed."
France,90,30,Chardonnay,white,Jean Rijckaert 2008 Epinet  (Viré-Clessé),"Rich, smooth, ripe flavors of wood with some pear and peach juice. Soft, but with good depth of flavor."
US,90,48,Pinot Noir,red,Witching Stick 2011 Gianoli Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge),"Former longtime Edmeades winemaker Van Williamson is offering the world his take on cool-climate Mendocino Pinot Noir with this and his Cerise Vineyard bottlings. This one is light in color but weighty on the palate with rich, spicy notes of raspberry-vanilla wafers and earth."
US,88,13,Pinot Gris,white,Firesteed 2013 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"Smooth-drinking, this offers soft, mellow flavors of melon and pear. Light but persistent, it's a clean, fresh and appealing selection, best enjoyed now."
US,89,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Rock Wall 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is hard in tannins and firm in acidity, which gives it fine structure. It's not shy in flavor, and it offers waves of blackberries, black currants and cassis liqueur, plus a note of toasty new oak. While it could develop well with age, the forward fruit suggests drinking it over the next five years."
France,89,41,Pinot Noir,red,Bouchard Aîné & Fils 2005 Les Marconnets Premier Cru  (Beaune),"Typical Beaune in its round, soft character. If the tannins are not particularly powerful, it still shows a generous nature, with super-ripe fruits supported by some dryness. The finish is jammy, ripe, a salad of red berries."
US,89,35,Syrah,red,Apsara 2011 Las Madres Vineyard Syrah (Carneros),"While it's on the soft, fruity side, this single-vineyard Syrah has the depth and complexity of a fine wine. Showing black and red currant, cola, plum, sandalwood and spice flavors, it's boosted by refined tannins and a proper dryness. Ready to drink now."
Italy,87,17,White Blend,white,Baglio del Cristo di Campobello 2011 C'D'C' White (Sicilia),"Chardonnay, Grillo, Insolia and Catarratto are blended in equal measure to provide a fresh yet complex wine. It bears a drying mineral tone, backed by notes of citrus, sweet peach and pear. A soft touch of fruity sweetness gives it roundness and depth."
Italy,89,89,Red Blend,red,Terralsole 2005 Pasticcio Red (Toscana),"A distinctive wine with firm, brooding notes of black fruit, kirsch and dried Mediterranean herbs. This is a fine-grained and elegant wine with chiseled graphite nuances and rock-solid tannins. It has great potential: Drink after 2010."
Italy,90,132,Sangiovese,red,Sesti 2011 Phenomena Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Aromas of underbrush, tobacco, used leather, scorched earth and a suggestion of oak slowly take shape in the glass. On the palate, round velvety tannins underscore raspberry compote, dried cherry and baking spice. It's rather forward so drink over the next several years."
US,85,15,Red Blend,red,Cirque du Vin 2009 Red (Paso Robles),"Made from a whole bunch of varieties—including Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon—this is a soft, fruity wine. It has lush flavors of blackberries, cherries and spices."
US,94,75,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Epoch Estate Wines 2013 Authenticity Red (Paso Robles),"Dark and thick in the glass, this blend of 82% Syrah and 18% Mourvèdre leads with black cherry syrup, smoked beef and dark chocolate aromas, which blossom as the wine opens. Rich and lavish on the palate, it has fine tannins that frame its blueberry, cassis and mocha flavors. It's firmly structured, with a lingering acidity."
US,92,60,Pinot Noir,red,Tendril 2014 Pretender White Pinot Noir Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This new entry into the growing ranks of Oregon Pinot Noir vinified in the style of a white wine belongs with the very best of them. A hint of tawny gold results from barrel fermentation (all neutral) and 16 months of lees stirring prior to bottling. It's rich and layered with toast, apples, pears, cream and a touch of citrus."
US,88,50,Chardonnay,white,Lynmar 2011 Divinity Late Harvest Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This sugary-sweet dessert Chardonnay tries hard to please, offering waves of honey, tangerine, mango and vanilla flavors. It's tantalizingly delicious, but could be just a tad more concentrated, especially at this price."
US,89,25,Zinfandel,red,Hobo 2007 Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"Soft and gentle, this is a Zin to drink right now for its lush, exotic flavors. It's dry, with dusty tannins and mouth-filling tastes of ripe crushed blackberries and cherries, baked into a pie and sprinkled with cocoa, cinnamon, nutmeg and black pepper, with a pinch of salt."
US,86,55,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Lawer 2011 Three Coins Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Flavors of ripe blackberry, cola and mulberry stand out in this dry, elegant Cab. The tannins are thick but the wine isn't likely to improve with age, so drink soon."
US,95,49,Pinot Noir,red,Marimar Estate 2008 Cristina Don Miguel Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The winery held this back an additional six months after their other 2008 Pinots were released, presumably to let it become integrated. Still, it's quite tannic, with a sandpaper-like toughness. Despite the astringency, the massive wild-cherry, cola, mushroom and anise flavors come through. It's a huge wine, feral and untamed—quite exquisite in its wildness. So delicious now, it's hard to resist, but the wise collector will cellar it for 4–5 years, maybe even longer."
US,93,110,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Stone The Crows 2014 Three Twins Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"From an estate vineyard, this impressive wine is earthy with tobacco leaf and juicy cherry and cassis notes. Soft, supple and lengthy, it lingers on the palate as a well-integrated, balanced and beautifully crafted expression of the grape."
Italy,87,15,Red Blend,red,La Braccesca 2014 Sabazio  (Rosso di Montepulciano),"Aromas of violet, wild red berry and dark cooking spice lift out of the glass. The aromas carry over to the soft, straightforward palate accompanied by mellow but rather fleeting tannins."
France,88,18,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Landereau 2015  Entre-Deux-Mers,"Situated on the ridge in the center of Entre-deux-Mers that produces fine white wines, this vineyard has produced a wine that is rich and full. Apricot and ripe pear fruits have a perfumed touch along with almond and spice flavors. It could do with a few more months and will be best from 2017."
US,86,22,Chardonnay,white,Napa Cellars 2014 Classic Collection Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"A hearty cradling of oak provides a tinge of vanilla sweetness here, before richer notions of apple pie and cinnamon tug at the wine's fuller-bodied core. It'll appeal to fans of this richer, riper style, while still finishing in a measure of acidity."
US,89,13,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Geyser Peak 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Dry and smoothly tannic, this wine is packed with complex blackberry-pie, currant, anise, herb and cedar flavors. This is nearly as good as the winery's more costly Walking Tree Vineyard Block Collection Cabernet, but it's just a little less concentrated."
France,95,685,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Jacques Prieur 2014  Chevalier-Montrachet,"This wine is opulent and rich without losing sight of the freshness of the vintage. Layers of new wood (100%) are blended with rich and perfumed fruits. At the same time, the acidity goes right through the wine, indicating an impressive future. It comes from a tiny patch of vines that gave two barrels. Drink from 2022."
Italy,90,60,Sangiovese,red,Ruffino 1997 Greppone Mazzi  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Musclebound with an earthy, spicy character to the nose. The body is fleshy but pure, offering black cherry flavors accented by tar and licorice. It finishes smooth, with just the right touch of vanilla oak. It's a polished Brunello, good for near-term drinking, but also a candidate for the cellar."
US,89,24,Pinot Gris,white,King Estate 2015 Paradox Barrel Aged Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Completing and complementing the winery's extensive portfolio of Pinot Gris, this is the only one that spends time in barrel. As a note to its uniqueness, the King Estate name is intentionally printed upside down on the label. Though there are no intrusive oak-dominated flavors, the technique definitely softens and smooths the wine, eliminating some of the aromatic details and much of the tang. It's ready to drink: lightly toasty, with pleasant apple and pear flavors."
France,87,26,Red Blend,red,Commanderie de la Bargemone 2009 Cuvée Marina Red (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),"This wine is rich with smooth tannins that meld into fresh red-fruit flavors. It's a juicy wine with a crisp, acidic finish. Drink now."
US,85,24,Pinot Noir,red,Honeywood Winery 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Far and away the freshest and most interesting of the three vintages submitted for review. The fruit retains more of its youthful gloss; it's riper and shows more cherry character, along with bright, spicy highlights. The tannins are proportionate and less earthy and herbal. This is no barn-burner, but it's a good quaffer."
US,87,18,Chardonnay,white,The Archivist 2014 Chardonnay (Monterey County),"Full and ripe with broad aromas of jasmine, cooked apple and lilies, this wine gets a twist from brown spice on the nose. The rich palate reflects a touch of cinnamon sprinkled on baked apples, along with flint, sandstone, pineapple and a smoky character."
France,88,29,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château La Bastienne 2009  Montagne-Saint-Émilion,"This richly perfumed wine is firm with tannins, showing its high alcohol through a sharp peppery edge. It is dense and concentrated, almost too much so to pair with food."
France,89,35,White Blend,white,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2015 Euskal Egun White (Irrouléguy),"From this small enclave in the foothills of the Basque Pyrenees, this blend of Gros Manseng, Petit Manseng and Petit Courbu is crisp, cool and perfumed. White stone fruits and a ripe tangy texture are cut with acidity and a bright, tight aftertaste. Drink from 2018."
France,85,10,Pinot Noir,red,Maison de la Villette 2016 Pinot Noir (Vin de France),"This ripe, structured wine is full of cherry flavors and crisp acidity. Spice and dark chocolate notes make an appearance, but the wine is mainly about perfumed fruit."
Italy,88,50,Sangiovese,red,Poggio Nardone 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,"Dark-skinned berry, underbrush and leather aromas lead the nose. The palate is firm, offering plum, toast, mocha and tobacco flavors, while assertive tannins leave a taut finish."
US,87,14,Red Blend,red,Girardet 2011 14 Vines Red (Umpqua Valley),"A mash-up of eight grapes, including such obscure varieties as Landot Noir, Maréchal Foch and Chancellor, this is the sort of wine you might happily enjoy while driving the back roads of rural Europe. Light, tart flavors of pie cherries are touched with leathery earth. Hints of plum and tobacco add further interest."
US,91,38,Pinot Noir,red,Flying Goat Cellars 2010 Salisbury Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"A vibrant minerality consumes the aromas on this bottling from an extremely coastal vineyard. On the palate, strawberry and sagebrush flavors emerge, all couched in a clean, crisp and refreshing acidity with appropriate bitterness as well. Ready to drink now."
US,88,30,Merlot,red,Columbia Crest 2011 Reserve Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This very limited reserve is from a particular block, and as with most block selections, it offers focused, somewhat constrained flavors. Precisely defined red berry fruit is set in a frame of vanilla, toast and coffee. It's a pleasant, albeit generic quaffer."
US,85,10,Pinot Grigio,white,Tamás 2008 Pinot Grigio (Central Coast),"This inexpensive white wine does a good job of being dry and ultracrisp in acidity, which gets the mouth watering. It offers pleasant flavors of Lifesaver candy pineapples and lemons, with a hint of vanilla."
US,86,58,Merlot,red,Twomey 2010 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This soft and approachable Merlot brims in smoke and oak, with subtle plum fruit. A slight layering of spice on the back of the palate is pleasing."
France,92,72,Chardonnay,white,Jean-Claude Boisset 2009 Champ Gain Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),"Still showing its youthful fruity character, this concentrated wine is going to develop richness while always retaining its elegance. The acidity and structured fruit lend a strong sense of minerality, although it keeps its ripeness. Age for 3–4 years."
France,86,14,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Buisson-Redon 2014  Bordeaux Blanc,"Intense with acidity and young fruitiness, this wine needs some time. The potential of the white and citrus fruit is there, with an herbaceous character that needs to soften. Drink from late 2015."
US,91,30,Chardonnay,white,Martin Ray 2015 Limited Release Chardonnay (Green Valley),"A blend of vineyards including the winery's Mill Station site, this white shines in steely acidity and layers of lemon, lime and grapefruit flavor. Tart and tangy with a light-handed approach to ripeness, it doesn't hold back on complexity, offering subtle vanilla tones on the finish."
France,96,231,Pinot Noir,red,Louis Jadot 2014  Echézeaux,"From one of the larger of the great grands crus of Vosne-Romanée and Flagey-Echézeaux, this is a dark, structured wine. It has power and juicy acidity that drive its black plum and berry fruit flavors. A dry core of tannins promises many years of maturing. Drink from 2026."
US,88,15,Pinot Gris,white,The Eyrie Vineyards 2008 Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills),"Sharp and driven with spicy pear and pineapple fruit, this challenging Pinot Gris is distinctive and tailored for food. The flavors seem to come from the grape skins more than the pulp, and there is no new oak to intercede. Fermented and aged in steel, put through malolactic, still showing plenty of acidity and spice."
US,88,20,Chardonnay,white,David Hill 2013 Estate Reserve Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Soft and buttery, this drink-now style is as smooth as a polished stone. The fruit is fairly generic and light, but the penetrating punch of popcorn and nut oil carries it along nicely."
US,92,43,Red Blend,red,Falkner 2011 Amante Red (Temecula Valley),"Perhaps Temecula's future is in Super Tuscans. This balanced blend of 50% Sangiovese, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 9% Cabernet Franc offers a complex nose of cranberry, pomegranate, pencil lead and chocolate sauce. Flavors of hot brick, white pepper, raspberry and stewed mushrooms rock the palate."
US,93,46,Pinot Noir,red,Couloir 2012 Monument Tree Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Another lovely Monument Tree Pinot from Couloir, this vintage is stemmy and earthy, yet soft, silky and voluptuous in all the right ways. It's pleasantly refined and ethereal, with whispers of cherry and raspberry fruitiness alongside equal parts gravitas and substance."
Italy,90,25,Red Blend,red,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi 2008 Tenuta di Castiglioni Red (Toscana),"This super Tuscan blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Sangiovese delivers rich softness and a plush, approachable style. You can't help but love those decadent layers of chocolate, spice and cherry liqueur."
Italy,85,14,White Blend,white,I Capitani 2007 Clarum White (Irpinia),"Here is an easy and straightforward Falanghina (with some Coda di Volpe) that offers sweet notes of yellow candy, peach fuzz, caramel and brown sugar. The wine is easy and fresh and could be served with hors d'oeuvres."
US,91,29,Merlot,red,Market Vineyards 2009 Benchmark Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is done in an open, palate-friendly style, with rich, generous black fruits accented with cocoa, coffee and caramel. There's a streak of vanilla custard also, and the fruit has enough depth and mass to hold up through a satisfying finish."
US,85,20,White Blend,white,Tarara 2010 Charval White (Virginia),"Hazy aromatics of sautéed apple and baking spice mark the nose, with notes of toasted nut and dill that surface on the palate. It feels full, round and supple, gaining some lift toward the close."
US,81,10,Syrah,red,McManis 2011 Syrah (California),"Despite some cherry and blackberry fruit, this is fairly simple and dull. It's soft and sweetly spicy."
US,85,38,Syrah,red,Four Vines 2005 Bailey Vineyard Syrah (Amador County),"There's plenty of ripe pie-filling fruit flavor in this dry wine. Cherries, blackberries, boysenberries and all sorts of other red fruits and berries mingle with melted chocolate, licorice and peppery spice. Turns a bit hot on the finish."
Italy,86,55,Red Blend,red,Villa Spinosa 2012  Amarone della Valpolicella,"This opens with aromas of spirits, underbrush, menthol and dried tobacco leaf. The assertive palate displays dried sour cherry, raisin and licorice alongside astringent tannins. It lacks fruit richness while scorching alcohol dominates the finish."
US,88,30,Red Blend,red,Fall Line 2006 Aldercreek Vineyard Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Bright, intense, spicy and sharp, this right bank-style Bordeaux blend brings red currant and berry scents and flavors. There is a chocolatey layer right under the fruit, but it's not entirely integrated, though these are good components. Give this one more bottle age."
France,88,30,Pinot Noir,red,Philippe Jeannot 2015 Quentin Jeannot La Fussière Premier Cru  (Maranges),This is a pale-colored wine with a soft texture and gentle strawberry fruits. The texture comes through slowly to give a firmer edge to what is a wine for medium-term aging. This is stylish and smooth. It should be drunk from 2018.
US,88,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Canoe Ridge 2013 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"This wine is a blend of fruit from Canoe Ridge, Wallula and Wahluke Slope vineyards. Aromas of dried herbs and leaves, green pepper and cherry are followed by a fruit-filled palate. The tannins come off as a bit scratchy."
France,91,36,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Ogier 2013 Oratorio  (Crozes-Hermitage),"Oak aging has added layers of vanilla and cinnamon, clove and menthol to this wine's ample black cherry fruit. There's a velvety plushness unusual for Crozes-Hermitage, but it adds welcome dimension to the finish."
US,93,60,Pinot Noir,red,Bergström 2014 Temperance Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Unusual aromatics conjure ruby red grapefruit, Douglas fir needles, green tea and a touch of cola. The site, which is rather cool, fills in the main palate with grapes offering sleek subtle flavors of mountain berry."
US,90,45,Zinfandel,red,Rock Wall 2015 Hendry Vineyard Block 29 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"This softly textured wine explodes with chocolate and strawberry flavors, a bright streak of acidity keeping its ripeness in check. Low in oak impact, it shows cigar and black licorice seasonings as it opens in the glass."
US,86,28,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Convergence Zone 2009 Storm Front Red Red (Red Mountain),"A Bordeaux-style blend, tart and fruity, with an unusual fruit flavor mix that starts with citrus and orange and runs into bright berries. Two things keep the score down—a chalky edge to the tannins, and some noticeable volatility (a whiff of nail polish)on the nose."
US,88,18,Chardonnay,white,Hovey 2010 Duende Chardonnay (Calaveras County),"A lovely Foothills Chardonnay from longtime area winemaker Chuck Hovey, who also makes the Stevenot wines. With strong apple and cinnamon personality the wine also has an intriguing creaminess to it, with lilting lemon meringue. Let it open slowly or place it in the cellar for 2–5 years to let the tartness on the finish disappear."
Italy,85,11,White Blend,white,Gorgo 2006  Custoza,"Garganega, Trebbiano, Tocai and Cortese are blended to shape a rich and thick wine with loads of fruit fragrances and honeysuckle aromas. The feel in the mouth is smooth and rich and this well-priced wine would pair perfectly with white meat or risotto."
France,90,39,Pinot Noir,red,Louis Jadot 2014  Marsannay,"This wine from the most northerly of the Côte d'Or appellations is a blend from multiple growers. It has red cherry and plum fruit with a fresh streak, typical of the vintage. Underlying firm tannins will sustain it as it ages. Drink from 2018."
US,88,13,Pinot Gris,white,O'Reilly's 2006 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"O'Reilly's is the budget label for Owen Roe, featuring an attentive wolfhound on the label. Crisp and bracing, this is loaded with textured pear and apple fruit, flavors of barrel fermentation and wonderful pearskin highlights."
US,89,14,Chardonnay,white,Treveri Cellars NV Blanc de Blancs Brut Méthode Champenoise Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas of pear, brioche and citrus peel are forward. The palate brings lively citrus and spice flavors that linger."
US,86,40,Pinot Noir,red,Adelaida 2011 Vineyard Series Doctor's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is a tasty Pinot Noir, but it's not particularly characteristic of Doctor's Vineyard or Santa Lucia Highlands. It's soft, ripe and sweet, and while the raspberry, cherry and red currant flavors are balanced with acidity, the wine tastes like it could have been grown anywhere. Drink now."
US,90,40,Riesling,white,Fox Run 2010 Riesling 11 Lake Dana Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Although it has a delicate structure, that feels almost lace-like on the palate, this light-bodied Riesling bursts with concentrated ripe peach and apricot flavors. Semisweet in style, this has vibrant acidity and an oyster-shell- and stone-like minerality that lingers on the long finish."
Italy,88,23,Sangiovese,red,Le Bocce 2010 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Aromas of sawdust, espresso and ripe dark-skinned fruit lead the nose. The plush palate offers dried black cherry, coffee, toast, licorice and black pepper alongside evolved tannins. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit and freshness."
US,90,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Buttonwood 2015 Musqué Sauvignon Blanc,"Refreshing on the nose, this clonal study shows lively and tropical aromas of Asian pear, guava, Meyer-lemon skin and that characteristic grassy note. It's racy on the palate, where green-apple rinds meet with lime skins, cement and crushed white rocks."
US,90,70,Pinot Noir,red,Ram's Gate 2012 Ulises Valdez Diablo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"High-toned strawberry and cherry open this medium-bodied wine that takes on heavier, darker overtones of dried herb, nutmeg and black tea as it goes. From a meticulously farmed vineyard also known for Chardonnay, it conveys a stamp of tobacco on the oak that invites thoughts of leather chairs and cigars."
France,89,83,Pinot Noir,red,L. Tramier & Fils 2015 Laurent Dufouleur  (Nuits-St.-Georges),"Firmly tannic and structured this is a young wine that will need time to soften. It has the foursquare character that is often found in Nuits Saint-Georges. The fruit weight is there, promising a ripe red-fruit future. The wine should be ready from 2020."
Italy,87,24,Red Blend,red,Planeta 2010  Cerasuolo di Vittoria,"Planeta has done a terrific job of communicating the merits of Cerasuolo di Vittoria to wine drinkers around the world. This light, ruby-colored red wine is packed with bright fruit nuances and a crisp mouthfeel. It makes an ideal pairing partner to the best Italian pasta recipes."
France,84,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Vieux Ferrand 2011 Cuvée Legta  (Lalande de Pomerol),"Lean, soft and soapy in character, this has a dry core and soft tannins, with a lightweight red-berry note. Not for aging."
US,90,75,Red Blend,red,Lorenzi Estate 2012 The Catalyst Red (Temecula Valley),"Candied red and black cherries, vanilla cookies, crushed stones and sweet kirsch aromas show on the nose of this red blend. The palate starts with brick and baked red-plum flavors, followed by waves of aniseseed, roasted fennel and fresh oregano. It's complex with cooked fruits."
US,84,24,Chardonnay,white,Stemmler 2011 Chardonnay (Carneros),"This simple wine tastes overly oaked, with woody notes overwhelming diluted citrus, tropical fruit and lees flavors. The acidity is great."
US,94,50,Pinot Noir,red,Roar 2008 Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Just exquisite, combining power with elegance to produce a truly great Pinot Noir. The vineyard is in the heart of the appellation. The cool climate has made it dry, crisp and silky, but it shows powerfully concentrated cherry, pomegranate, mocha and bacon flavors, with overlays of smoky sandalwood. Compellingly good, this Pinot will develop over the next 6–8 years."
US,93,60,Chardonnay,white,Sanguis 2011 Loner W11-A Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"This is the most dynamic 2011 entry in Matthias Pippig's Loner series, starting with aromas of lemon juice, lime sorbet, wet chalk, white pepper and crushed herbs. The tight, mineral-driven flavors dance across diced peaches and baked apples, with lime spritzer and baking soda thrown on top."
US,86,25,Riesling,white,Buttonwood Grove 2015 Frances Amelia Riesling (Finger Lakes),Vibrant lemon and tangerine acidity freshens savory tones of pressed apples and nuts in this slightly rustic earthy Riesling. It's dry on the palate and finishes briskly.
US,86,28,Syrah,red,Fess Parker 2010 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Complex, rich flavors of mulberry, cola, leather, pepper and sandalwood mark this dry, tannic Syrah. The texture is aggressive, with jagged tannins. Ready to drink."
US,90,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Enos Vineyard 2013 Totem Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon (Knights Valley),"This is sourced from a steep site on the southern end of the appellation, a sunny location that provides concentration and weight to the wine. Smoky, herbal and earthy, it offers a wealth of rounded tannin and approachable texture that's complemented by dark cherry, blackberry, clove and vanilla."
US,92,38,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Avennia 2011 Justine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The Justine, a new, southern Rhône-style red blend from Avennia, is an expressive wine, with aromas of berries, plums and cassis. There's a whiff of smoked meat also, but the Grenache—roughly half of the blend—brings lovely fruit that trumps the rest. Delicious now, or cellar it for a few more years."
US,92,85,Red Blend,red,San Antonio 2014 Centennial Blend Red (Paso Robles),"Winemakers Anthony Riboli and Arnaud Debons crafted this blend of 36% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Malbec, 21% Petit Verdot, 11% Petite Sirah and 4% Syrah to celebrate the winery's 100th year, with big and tasty results. Ripe blackberry, black currant, blueberry, caramel and dried herb aromas show on the nose, while dark elderberry, lavender and thyme flavors mark the palate. The package is rich and powerful, yet spicy and structured."
US,80,25,Zinfandel,red,Moss Roxx 2011 Ancient Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),This offers allspice aromas around a thin core of hard-to-decipher fruit and a finish that veers into burnt-rubber territory.
Italy,89,18,Red Blend,red,Paolo Calì 2015 Jazz Red (Terre Siciliane),"This blend of 55% Frappato and 45% Nero d'Avola opens with red cherry, crushed strawberry, clove and white pepper aromas that carry over to bright, polished palate. It's ready and enjoyable, with silky tannins and fresh acidity."
US,87,25,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Gary Farrell 2011 Russian River Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"The winemaker took a Chardonnay approach, giving the wine lots of barrel fermentation and lees aging. The result is a rich, softly textured 100% Sauvignon Blanc, with lime, kiwi and vanilla flavors, wrapped into a creamy, buttery mouthfeel."
US,88,68,Pinot Noir,red,Migration 2014 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Gravelly aromas of wet slate meet with dark cranberry and baked red cherry on the nose of this bottling, which the Duckhorn crew sources from this historic vineyard. The palate is relatively light with very earthy flavors, showing tangy red fruit, thyme and wet soil flavors."
US,89,50,Pinot Noir,red,Amalie Robert 2012 Estate Selection Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Brambly berry fruit is dotted with highlights of black pepper and tart tangy herbs. The acids are way out in front of the fruit, delivering a citrusy, lightly toasty kick to the finish."
US,87,65,Pinot Noir,red,Colene Clemens 2014 Victoria Estate Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This wine starts off with a broad blend of berries and cherries, and well-integrated, smooth tannins. But in the finish and aftertaste, a chemical bitterness emerges and persists."
US,82,30,Sangiovese,red,Orfila 2010 Estate Sangiovese,"There may be an interesting wine lurking in the dark shadows here, but the oak and alcohol are overpowering in ways that mask the plummy cinnamon within."
US,89,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Jaxon Keys 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino County),"A great first effort from the new Jaxon Keys winery's estate Sauvignon Blanc vineyard, with green apple, pear, ripe melon and honey prominent throughout the wine's rich, creamy texture, with just a touch of key lime. A great example of inland Mendocino Sauvignon Blanc."
US,92,50,Chardonnay,white,Amalie Robert 2012 Heirloom Cameo Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This barrel-fermented, estate-grown wine matches its luscious citrus and pineapple fruit to veins of butter, caramel and toast. It's perfectly balanced, lively and fresh, even after being open for a full 24 hours. The style, now becoming particular to many Oregon Chardonnays, sits squarely on the fence between the hyper-lushness of California and the minerality of northern Burgundies."
US,96,78,Pinot Noir,red,Williams Selyem 2010 Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"While this vineyard is close by the Russian River and is not considered the best of Rochioli's vineyards, winemaker Bob Cabral consistently makes its grapes into one of Williams Selyem's most compelling wines. This shows the impeccable tannins and acids of Rochioli fruit, with sweet, ripe, deep flavors of cherry and spice. Notes of pomegranate, rum punch, dark chocolate and smoky sandalwood add complexity. Beautiful to drink now, it should continue to develop for at least 10 years."
France,90,56,Chardonnay,white,Joseph Drouhin 2008  Chassagne-Montrachet,"A big, ripe wine that also keeps an edgy character, typical of the year. It has a fine contrast between full apple and pear fruits and a zesty tang of acidity and texture. It does need a few months' aging."
France,86,10,White Blend,white,Gabriel Meffre 2015 La Châsse Sauvignon-Grenache White (Vin de France),"Since this wine comes from a big Rhône producer, it's no surprise the blend is 50% Grenache Blanc. The other 50% is Sauvignon Blanc. It is an effective, balanced medley, with the fat Grenache given a burst of freshness by the Sauvignon. The wine is light, lively and fruity. Drink now."
US,94,48,Syrah,red,Donelan 2012 Cuvée Christine Syrah (Sonoma County),"This 100% Syrah comes from four parcels of high-elevation sites across Sonoma, many of them otherwise single-vineyard designated by the winery. Here, the blending pays off in refined, gamy, sanguine undertones that evolve in the glass to meet mouthfilling black currant, fine-grain leather and white pepper. An acidic lift on the finish balances the wine's power."
US,85,18,Zinfandel,red,Pezzi King 2009 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Sugary sweet and soft, with jammy raspberry, cherry, mocha, vanilla, cinnamon, clove and pepper flavors. It's a country-style Zin made for washing down barbecue."
US,88,30,Pinot Noir,red,A Blooming Hill Vineyard 2014 Trouble Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Pommard and Wädenswil clones make up this cuvée. Chunky fruit flavors of sour plum and cherry are on display, with decent penetration and moderate length. Drink now through 2022."
US,90,17,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Sivas-Sonoma 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"Integrated acidity and ripeness allow for a Good & Plenty licorice-like note, accenting the fresh apricot and white peach flavors in this lovely, easygoing sipper."
US,83,10,Riesling,white,Forest Glen 2012 Riesling (California),"Shows the flowery, honeyed notes of Riesling, with pleasant citrus, apple and peach flavors. It's a little soft, but will drink well with ham, sausages or just about anything with bacon."
US,93,72,Pinot Noir,red,Dutton-Goldfield 2013 Dutton Ranch Freestone Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This tightly wound wine opens in the glass, with intense, bright acidity that wraps around herbal, minty undertones. Blackberry, raspberry and clove give it plenty of varietal classicism, but it's the strong earthy loam and forest floor that provide intrigue and elegance."
US,94,55,Pinot Noir,red,Siduri 2007 Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Shows the impeccably ripe fruitiness and purity that characterize Siduri Pinot Noirs, with the powerful structure of this celebrated vineyard. Dry and fairly tannic, the wine's flavors are of cherry pie filling, red currants, anise liqueur, chocolate and pepper spice. Fabulously hedonistic now, and should slowly build momentum for the next six years."
US,87,27,Chardonnay,white,Domaine LeSeurre 2014 Barrel Select Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Toast and dried herb tones in this Chardonnay lend savoriness to fresher, fruitier expressions of apple, lemon and pear. It's light on its feet and delicate in concentration, finishing briskly."
US,91,95,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Feliz Noche 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County),"A concentrated nose of cherry compote, burned vanilla bean, black pepper and dried dill invite the nose into this wine by former field hand turned respected winemaker Felipe Hernandez. It's incredibly delicious upon sipping, with cherry sauce and blueberry and blackberry fruits, all leveled by a graphite and slate minerality."
France,85,35,Chardonnay,white,Jean-Christophe Perraud 2014  Mâcon La Roche Vineuse,This tangy wine with spice and acidity has kiwi and lime flavors that give a fresh character. The aftertaste is lightly perfumed. Drink now.
France,83,15,Riesling,white,Pierre Deschamps 2012 Riesling (Alsace),"Soft and aromatic, this is a crisp, clean and fruity wine. It has some sweetness (not indicated on the label) with lime and tangy citrus flavors. It's ready to drink."
US,91,50,Pinot Noir,red,Vidon Vineyard 2013 Hans Clone Pommard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Softly smoky, with pretty strawberry and raspberry fruit, this strikes a lovely balance. The mouthfeel is smooth and seductive, the flavors seamless and the balance spot on."
US,87,25,Merlot,red,Claar 2011 Estate Grown and Bottled Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine opens with aromas of vanilla and baking spices that are followed by broad, silky-feeling fruit and barrel flavors, finishing on a somewhat bitter note. The oak holds a prominent role but still plays its part well."
Italy,90,32,Chardonnay,white,Montenisa 2004 Brut Satèn Chardonnay (Franciacorta),"Loads of peach and honey open the nose of this creamy, rich Chardonnay-based sparkling wine. In the mouth, the wine delivers sharp acidity and piquant effervescence."
US,88,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Eight Bells 2013 David's Block Red Willow Vineyard Red (Yakima Valley),"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Cabernet Franc, Carménère, Merlot and Petit Verdot, coming from a block designed by the late Master of Wine David Lake. Light aromas of herb, green pepper and cherry are followed by elegant fruit flavors that seem a bit faint. The oak appears to be dialed way back. Best paired with food."
France,88,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Barreyre 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur,"Fresh and juicy, this is a wine where the fruit is already well in balance with the tannic core. It is structured and firm while allowing plenty of room for the red fruits and acidity. Drink from 2018."
US,87,24,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Kendall-Jackson 2012 Vintner's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Tight and tannic, this majority Cab wine is distinguished by a thickness of black fruit and herbaceous back palate that gives it density, separated by bursts of vanilla and oak. Give it time to open and notes of mocha chocolate should also come through."
Italy,89,34,Sangiovese,red,Cantalici L'Antica Fornace di Ridolfo 2011 Messer Ridolfo Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Leather, truffle, ripe berry and a whiff of oak-derived spice lead the nose of this 100% Sangiovese wine. The taut palate delivers mature plum, black cherry and licorice flavors, its fine-grained tannins leaving a firm, dry finish."
Italy,91,43,Chardonnay,white,Planeta 2009 Chardonnay (Sicilia),"Planeta's Chardonnay is one of the nicest expressions of this international grape variety made on Italian soil. From sunny Sicily, the wine recalls some of the characteristics of Chardonnay from California, with its creamy, rich mouthfeel and beautifully intense aromas of stone fruit, citrus, vanilla, yellow rose and exotic spice."
US,92,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Ambassador Vineyard 2012 Envoy Estate Grown Red (Red Mountain),"Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc make up equal parts of this wine, with pinches of Petit Verdot and Malbec blended in. Vanilla, cocoa, coffee, herb and cherry aromas are followed by generous fruit and barrel flavors supported by tightly wound tannins. The wood is primary right now. It will be best after 2021."
US,90,40,Pinot Noir,red,Thistle 2012 Block 21 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"A single-clone, single-block cuvée, this is nonetheless complete and satisfying. Blackberry and black cherry fruit are dusted with cinnamon and allspice. A vein of cola and a whiff of sandalwood add further complexity. More elegant than powerful, this retains its balance through a medium-long finish."
US,85,36,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Dogwood 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino),"A little rough and rugged, with jangly tannins and blackberry fruit so ripe it veers into raisins. Very dry, it's probably at its best now."
US,89,36,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Six Sigma Ranch 2012 Bootleg Limited Release Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),"A 50-case release from Six Sigma, this Sauvignon Blanc is fleshy, dark and complex, complete with lime, lemon and guava tones. It'll stand up to creamy shellfish dishes or a platter of fresh oysters—an intense study in barrel-kissed Lake County Sauvignon Blanc."
US,94,35,Chardonnay,white,Marimar Estate 2010 Don Miguel Vineyard La Masía Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"There's a lot of lees influence on this wine, which gives it a sourdough taste and creamy mouthfeel. It's dense in tropical fruit, citrus, green apple and honey notes, with a touch of sweet, smoky oak. A dry, complex, multilayered wine, this will gain traction with 2–4 years in the cellar."
France,88,37,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Belland 2013 Comme Dessus  (Santenay),"This is a soft, fresh while rounded wine. A gentle texture hints at a more tangy character while pushing the apple and spice flavors forward. Attractive now, the wine is ready to drink."
US,84,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Ackerman 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville),"Despite the relatively low alcohol, this wine feels curiously hot, enough to lower the score. Chili pepper notes dominate the fruit."
US,86,17,Riesling,white,Ravines 2008 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Sunny and warm on the nose with aromas of honey, roasted hazelnuts and a touch of petroleum, this medium-bodied dry Riesling surprises with an unexpected austerity in the mouth. It's an interesting transition, however, resulting in a sleek, steely wine with hints of chalk dust, bitter lime and canned pineapple flavors."
US,91,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Berryhill 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Lodi),"This is an unusually complex and intricate wine that has more than simple crispness. It starts with grapefruit and bitter apple aromas and builds toward vibrant but rich grapefruit, mineral and savory consommé flavors. The texture is broad and mouthfilling but well supported and balanced by acidity. A great debut for Berryhill."
France,84,30,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château des Tourtes 2014 Prestige  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"From a 17-acre Merlot-dominated vineyard, this is a dry wine, where the tannins dominate the fruit. The wine has a bitter edge from too much extraction. The hints of fruit are not quite enough."
France,95,30,Riesling,white,Domaines Schlumberger 2009 Kessler Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"There is both wonderful bite and density to this great wine. It has a weighty texture full of ripe, rich fruit. At the same time, the wine is bone dry and crisp with acidity. It' s just beginning to mature, and while enjoyable now, it's better to wait until 2016."
US,88,70,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Trinchero 2012 Cloud's Nest Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"A full-bodied, robust expression of the variety from an appellation that can sometimes be relatively cool, this shows deft characteristics of savory pepper, cedar and a tightness of lively acidity. While fresh it's also heavy, with a finish of black tea."
US,89,23,Syrah,red,Lafond 2012 SRH Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),"Toasted herbs, pressed violets, cola and a touch of tar frame the nose on this wine from pioneer Pierre Lafond and winemaker Bruce McGuire. The palate offers purple-flower candy flavors, with light elderberry juice and a lifting clove-meets-mint character."
US,92,45,Pinot Noir,red,Aubichon Cellars 2012 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This shows some extra concentration in its plum and cherry fruit. The mouthfeel has a pleasing texture, and the streaks of herb and cola are nicely integrated. As with many of the wines of this vintage, it's forward and fruit-driven and ready for immediate enjoyment."
US,92,39,Zinfandel,red,Sol Rouge 2013 Zinfandel (Red Hills Lake County),Intensely ripe and concentrated fruit flavors dominate both the aromas and flavors of this very full-bodied but ultrasmooth wine. Light notes of dried sage and cinnamon dust the blackberry jam and candied-strawberry flavors for a nuanced complexity despite the high alcohol and supreme ripeness.
US,88,40,Pinot Noir,red,Witness Tree 2010 Vintage Select Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Though it was given twice as many new French oak barrels as the Estate bottling, this Vintage Select could be its twin. Solid and balanced, it mixes berry, herb and earth components, making for a well-structured, no-frills wine."
Italy,91,28,Red Blend,red,Castello d'Albola 2012 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Alluring scents of chopped mint, ripe berry, new leather, clove and a floral note all come together on this elegantly structured wine. The taut palate delivers black cherry, raspberry, fresh herb and dark baking spice while polished tannins provide structure. Drink 2017–2022."
France,97,125,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,J.L. Chave 1999  Hermitage,"Jean-Louis, the son of Gérard Chave, is now in charge of the family business, as well as being president of the Hermitage wine producers. He is continuing the family tradition of making powerful statements of Syrah from Hermitage, combining massive structure and over-powering perfumes. This 1999 seems to have the best of the traditional world of tannic immensity and the modern world of beautiful, ripe fruit. A wine that will age for a very long time."
Italy,85,21,White Blend,white,Tenuta San Francesco 2007 Tramonti White (Campania),"This intriguing blend of Falanghina, Biancolella and Pepella (three relatively unknown indigenous grapes) has a candy- or soda-like quality that recalls butterscotch and caramel. However, those notes are balanced by an elegant mineral tone and the wine has good dimension on the close."
US,90,40,Syrah,red,Ryan Patrick 2013 Red Heaven Vineyard Reserve Syrah (Red Mountain),"The aromas offer notes of dark coffee, baking spice, vanilla, and barrel spices. The palate pulls no punches with full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors along with lightly grainy tannins. The wood plays prominently but it works."
US,84,24,Pinot Noir,red,Simi 2011 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"This is a sound Pinot for everyday drinking. It brings some structural finesse to fairly simple sour cherry candy and cola flavors. There's a touch of green veggies that limits enjoyment, though."
US,89,20,Red Blend,red,Tre Nova 2009 Nebbaro Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The name refers to the blend of 62% Barbera and 38% Nebbiolo sourced from a pair of Horse Heaven Hills vineyards. A little high-toned on the nose, the wine eventually smoothes out in the glass, and it offers pretty flavors of raspberry and Bing cherry. Succulent and nicely balanced, this is one of the better Washington examples of these two grapes."
US,90,125,Pinot Noir,red,White Rose 2014 White Rose Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"A very pretty wine, in scent and flavor, this estate-grown effort offers aromas of rose petals and cherry blossoms. Those floral notes continue into the palate, with light cherry fruit and citrusy acids."
US,88,40,Pinot Noir,red,Tondré 2010 Tondré Grapefield Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is a big, extracted wine, voluptuous with cherry, plum, Dr. Pepper, pomegranate and oak flavors. It has Pinot's silky texture and the delightfully crisp acidity typical to this central part of Monterey County. You might want to cellar it for 3–4 years to see if it can mellow out."
Italy,85,48,Sangiovese,red,Mocali 2011 Vigna delle Raunate  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Funky aromas of scorched earth, game, cured meat, and a whiff of barnyard carry over to the palate along with overripe plum and a distinctly bitter note. Grainy, fleeting tannins leave an astringent finish."
US,86,10,Chardonnay,white,Rebusity 2012 Chardonnay (California),"A generous, smooth texture and nicely bright flavors of lemon, lime and apple make this a satisfying wine. It is medium to full bodied, soft in acidity, but fresh in flavor. It should be a winner for large groups."
US,90,30,Syrah,red,Firestone 2012 Clone 174 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Black cherry, smoked beef jerky, burned caramel and a touch of maduro cigar show on the nose of this study of a popular Syrah clone. The palate is equally savory, with smoked meats, blackberry fruit, crushed black pepper, soy and a tarry edge, bolstered by sparkling acidity."
US,91,40,Merlot,red,Black Stallion 2013 Limited Release Merlot (Napa Valley),"This bold, full-bodied wine is understated in its layering of cassis, currant and juicy black cherry, with hints of clove and smoked meat. It's well balanced, with an enduring and evolving finish."
US,85,9,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Bogle 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"A good example of a California Sauvignon Blanc, this white shows citrus, hay, fig and spicy green-melon flavors. It's dry and crisp, making it balanced, and a good accompaniment to food."
US,95,75,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Duckhorn 2004 Red Wine Red (Howell Mountain),"Almost entirely Merlot, with a few drops of other Bordeaux varieties, this Howell Mountain red screams for time in the cellar. The tannins bite and dog the mouth through the long, astringent finish. But chew on it for a while and you hit a deep core of blackberries and currants, and the more the wine warms up in the glass, the more impressive it gets. Cellar until 2010, and it should reward for years after."
Italy,88,43,Sangiovese,red,Castello di Meleto 2013 Vigna Casi  (Chianti Classico),"Aromas of ripe dark-skinned berry, purple flower and a whiff of cake spice waft out of the glass. The firm palate offers black cherry, red plum and a note of ground pepper while fine-grained tannins and nervous acidity provide the framework."
US,86,30,Pinot Noir,red,De Loach 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Earthy compost and forest vie for attention in this full-bodied, lush wine that's lightly spiced with clove. Cranberry, strawberry and a hint of leather round out the experience."
Italy,87,11,Pinot Grigio,white,Villa Carra 2001 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Grave),"Not a typically fruity Grigio, this one relies more on spices and minerals to make a palate impression. Hints of almond and dried cinnamon start things off, followed by stony, mineral flavors backed by pears and allspice."
US,88,16,Red Blend,red,Canoe Ridge 2015 The Expedition Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"This wine is just over two-thirds Merlot, the balance in Syrah, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Dark plum, coffee, bittersweet chocolate and spice aromas are followed by medium-bodied fruit flavors backed by plump tannins. It goes down easy."
US,87,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Bell 2006 Claret Red (Napa Valley),"Claret is the old-fashioned word for Bordeaux, but it has no legal meaning in the U.S. This Cabernet-based wine contains some Syrah, which gives a smoked meat or bacon note to the blackberries and black currants. It's delicious, if a little sweet."
Italy,84,7,Pinot Grigio,white,Kirkland Signature 2011 Pinot Grigio (Grave del Friuli),"Okay, this Pinot Grigio is easy, thin and simple, but at this low price it makes the perfect wine for informal occasions, barbecues or pool parties. Peach and citrus are the main aromatic indicators."
US,87,16,Chardonnay,white,Anapamu 2001 Chardonnay (Monterey County),"From Gallo's Central Coast brand, a lean, tart and minerally Chardonnay marked by flavors of flint and lime just veering into tart green apple. Extremely well made, and not without interest, but if big, blowsy Chards are your thing, look elsewhere."
France,85,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine D'en Ségur 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Côtes du Tarn),"Grapefruit flavor is the key to this attractive, fruity wine. Crisp and lightly herbaceous, it is fresh while also having a rounder background. Drink now, but better to wait until early 2016."
US,91,38,Merlot,red,Camaraderie 2008 Reserve Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This reserve spends 30 months in barrel. It has lovely aromatics, with subtle suggestions of tobacco and clove woven through the base of ripe black cherry and cassis. The tannins are polished, and the finish lends a thread of iron."
US,81,19,Zinfandel,red,Opolo 2011 Summit Creek Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Overripe, with raisiny flavors, and hot in alcohol. Tart acidity gives it cut."
France,86,17,White Blend,white,Le Classique from the 3 Springs Vineyard 2007 White (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),"At three years old, this wine is showing some interesting developed aromas of almond paste and petrol while the lightweight palate displays some nice butter tones. Pick this one up soon, for it seems to be fading."
US,95,85,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Shafer 2013 One Point Five Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"The velvety approachability of this soft, supple wine belies a strength and sophistication always at the heart of this producer's wines, an intensity of flavor and power that commands attention. Black currant, black cherry, sage and smoky oak ride atop an underground of black pepper, combining ultimately into a tantalizingly juicy package. Drink now through 2023."
Italy,86,16,Red Blend,red,Aia Vecchia 2009 Lagone Red (Toscana),"A pungent touch of apple skin or root beer gives this wine a sharp, immediate personality. At the back are dark fruit, leather and spice aromas and a clean, tonic finish."
US,90,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Barboursville Vineyards 2009 Octagon Red (Virginia),"This Octagon is dark and charred smelling, with aromas of blackberry, cocoa, savory spice and cherry. The palate is tight yet finessed, bearing vigorous yet manageable tannins that should eventually fade with time to reveal a charming wine. Flavors of graphite, fines herbes and coffee grounds add interest to the finish."
US,88,26,Red Blend,red,Kriselle 2013 Di'tani Red (Rogue Valley),"Roughly half Cab Franc, this includes Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Tempranillo as well. Here the fruit is accented, not overtaken, with the flavors of barrels. The best of the winery's red wines, it augments its pretty cherry core with a streak of coffee and dark chocolate."
US,91,32,White Blend,white,Elyse 2012 L'Ingenue Naggiar Vineyard White (Sierra Foothills),"Distinctive and generous, this white Rhône-style wine is made from Sierra Foothills grapes by a seasoned Napa winemaker. It tastes like vanilla, hazelnuts and pears, has a creamy texture, feels layered with fruit and spice notes, and has good acidity balanced by richness of flavor."
US,88,33,Red Blend,red,"Fallbrook 2008 33 Degrees North Gracie Hill Vineyard, Dalla Collina Red (South Coast)","This wine opens with a full Zin-like nose, all pepper and plum with traces of blackberry and though it's a touch oaky the wine's easy to drink with soft, ripe tannins. A blend of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Merlot."
US,93,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Laurel Glen 2014 Counterpoint Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Mountain),"Blended with 10% Merlot, this wine sources grapes both from its famous estate, as well as from nearby Pickberry and Murray vineyards. It delights in luxuriously bright acidity and a jammy explosion of blackberry, chocolate, clove and tobacco, the texture roundly approachable."
France,88,14,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château de Laville 2010  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux,"A full, rich wine, showing red fruits at their best. It has structure and layers of bright acidity. It's not a wine for long aging, likely to be at its best in three years time."
US,90,25,Pinot Noir,red,Atwater 2013 North Block Five Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),"Pretty violet notes reverberate through this richly concentrated, nuanced Pinot Noir. Dried cherry and blackberry touches are succulent and lip smacking yet anchored by delicate veins of mineral and spice. Fine-grained tannins persist through a long finish. Drink now through 2023."
France,93,55,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Léognan 2014  Pessac-Léognan,"Under the attention of the Miecaze family, this ancient estate has burst out of a dormant period and into new life with vineyards, a winery, a restaurant and a B&B. This latest vintage is powerfully dense and with great swathes of tannins and perfumed fruit. The wine is stylish, while also being ripe and full in the mouth. It has fine potential and will be ready from 2020."
US,91,78,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Tenor 2012 2:2 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Mostly Merlot (68%) and Cabernet Franc (26%) along with a smidgen of Cabernet, this wine brings aromas of toast, vanilla bean, red and black fruit and fresh herb. The palate is dense and full, with firm tannins providing the frame."
Italy,89,16,White Blend,white,Pieropan 2012  Soave Classico,"This wine shows more character and finesse than most other Italian whites in this price range. Subtle aromas of apples, peach and mineral carry over to the bright, savory palate along with citrus notes and crisp acidity. It has nice length and leaves the mouth feeling clean and fresh."
US,90,34,White Blend,white,Bennett Lane 2014 Maximus White Feasting Wine White (Napa Valley),"The producer's proprietary blend of 89% Sauvignon Blanc, 10% Chardonnay and 1% Muscat, this wine is fresh and fiery, bright on the palate in apple, Asian pear and jicama, with a dusting of dried herb and ginger as it goes down."
US,86,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Sojourn 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"From a winery whose Cabernets have struggled over the years comes this release from Napa's Howell Mountain. It's dry and tannic and very fruity in blackberries and black currants, but not particularly subtle right now. Feels somewhat common despite its pedigreed appellation. Try the cellar."
US,90,37,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,One Hope 2009 Signature Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Blended with 10% Syrah, this is a voluptuous, rich wine, dry and full-bodied. It has blackberry, blueberry, chocolate, bacon and sweet oak flavors. Clearly the winery's best, albeit most expensive Cabernet ever, it's gorgeous to drink now."
US,88,13,Red Blend,red,Seven Daughters 2014 Rich Red Winemaker's Blend Red (California),"Very ripe and fruity and ultra smooth in texture, this wine is a treat to drink and a very good value. A touch of sweetness adds to the supple mouthfeel and helps carry the boysenberry and blueberry notes through the finish."
US,95,72,Pinot Noir,red,Donum 2014 Year of the Horse Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Seductive and velvety, this concentrated Pinot Noir is richly layered in raspberry cherry cordial, cardamom and cola flavors. Pine and allspice notes contribute a homey spiciness as as the fullness of the wine lingers into a long finish."
France,92,72,Pinot Noir,red,Chanson Père et Fils 2013 Clos de Marconnets Premier Cru  (Beaune),"Ripe, jammy fruitiness gives this wine a generous feel. Packed with opulent berry flavor, it will develop well. It is rich and rounded, nicely supported by the tannins that are in the background. Drink from 2019."
France,88,25,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Pascal et Mireille Renaud 2015  Saint-Véran,"This rounded wine is soft and ripe. Along with its smooth, warm texture it offers generous pear and melon flavors. Acidity adds an attractive final crispness. Drink now."
US,84,25,Chardonnay,white,Chalone Vineyard 2010 Estate Chardonnay (Chalone),"This is overoaked, with buttered toast, caramel and sweet vanilla flavors dominating everything else. Buried beneath the oak are crisp flavors of pineapples and oranges."
Italy,94,60,Red Blend,red,Pietro Caciorgna 2006 N'Anticchia  (Etna),"Here's a surprise from Mt. Etna that blew us away. Made by Pietro Caciorgna, this is a delicate and linear wine with pristine aromas of blue flower, delicate forest fruit and black stone. It represents the best of elegant winemaking with that unmistakable blast of volcanic power at the rear."
US,86,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Castoro Cellars 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),"A ripe character of Anjou pear and nectarine flesh mesh with honeydew rinds and smashed cement minerality on the nose of this bottling. The palate shows a touch of smoke wrapped around green and yellow pear flesh, plus cooked apples in the midpalate."
US,84,10,Sauvignon Blanc,white,un4seen 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Lodi),"Notes of sour apple and lemon accompany this wine's dialed-high acidity. Priced to sell, it'll suffice in certain settings as an apéritif or quaffer with snacks."
US,88,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Wild Hogge 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"A densely layered nose shows boysenberry, plum blossoms, mocha, coffee, kola nut and purple flowers. More cola shows on the palate with black cherry, plum-skin tartness and uplifting purple flowers, all presented on smooth tannins."
US,86,35,Riesling,white,Treleaven 2011 EIS Late Harvest Riesling (Cayuga Lake),"Notes of dried fig, citrus rind and tangerines are spiked with whiffs of potpourri and spice on this richly textured, unctuously sweet iced wine made from late-harvest grapes frozen after harvest. Creamy and lush on the finish, it's brightened by a shower of orange acidity and just a hint of black-tea astringency."
Italy,86,18,Red Blend,red,Sada 2010 Integolo Red (Toscana),"This easy blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Montepulciano  and Alicante opens with a bright cherry note and slightly bitter tones of spice and almond skin. The palate is smoothly textured and rich."
US,93,55,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Tenor 2011 2:2 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is 35% Merlot, 34% Cabernet Franc, 27% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Malbec. It brings a whole lot of appeal with its aromas of coffee, woodspice, blackberries and dark cherries. The palate shows a mixture of grace and power and the finish won't quit."
US,92,155,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Jarvis 2009 Lake William Red (Napa Valley),"A blend of almost equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller handfuls of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this estate-grown wine is sanguine in smoky leather and tobacco. Rich, with a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg, it has a lengthy finish that is balanced and elegant on the palate."
US,92,65,Pinot Noir,red,Daou 2012 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Though more focused on Bordeaux varieties, the Daou brothers produce a fantastic Pinot Noir to chew on, with rich aromas of cherry pie set in a anise-flecked crust. The wine is soft and plush once sipped, with black cherries, root beer and strong black licorice elements."
US,91,36,Pinot Noir,red,Transcendence 2012 F Street Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"A welcome barnyard funk of sour cherry, wet leather and mulched shrubbery kicks off the nose on this wine from the likable Joey Gummere, once know for the Kenneth-Crawford wines. Fennel seed flavors and violet characters emerge on the very pretty palate, which has both tannins and mouth-washing acid on the finish."
US,87,32,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Basel Cellars 2010 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Hailing from the cool 2010 vintage, this 100% varietal wine leads with barrel aromas of vanilla and freshly hewn wood followed by medicine cabinet and dried cherry, seeming advanced for its years. The flavors are elegant in style with the concentration a bit wanting."
US,92,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Wolf Family 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A lovely Cab, polished and refined, and a huge improvement over the winery's 2004 bottling. Shows classic Napa Valley softness and roundness, a wine that seduces the palate. There are complex flavors of black currants, sweet sage and cedar, wrapped into silky, ripe tannins. Delicious now, and should develop for a decade or more."
US,86,20,Pinot Noir,red,Tolosa 2013 Estate Rosé of Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"In this pale rosé, freshly cut orange and papaya mousse aromas are cut with a bit of flintiness. The wine plays to the citrus side of the pink scale, with lemon rind and pink grapefruit flavors. It's a bit more watery than other rosés of the vintage."
US,85,25,Chardonnay,white,Lamoreaux Landing 2011 Estate Bottled Unoaked Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Fragrant with notes of grapefruit, apple and lemon, this dry, delicately-framed Chardonnay is crisp with lemony acidity and an elegant citrus-rind flavor. It's refreshing and easy drinking, but could use a boost of intensity in the mid palate."
US,89,30,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,14 Hands 2013 Reserve M-S-G-V Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Mourvèdre and Syrah each make up a third of this wine with the rest Grenache and Viognier. The latter (12%) shows itself prominently on the aromas, with perfumed notes of purple flowers and orange peel that are followed by purple fruit, vanilla, coffee and spice. The palate offers elegant, yet sweet and flavorful pomegranate and cranberry flavors with pleasing spice accents."
France,88,15,Red Blend,red,Cave du Marmandais 2011 La Vieille Eglise Red (Côtes du Marmandais),"Some firm tannins give solid structure and smoky character to this wine, an exotic blend of Merlot, Abouriou and Malbec. The juicy berry fruits are round and full in the mouth. It's a ripe wine, with a solid structure that gives balance to the fruitiness."
US,88,24,Red Blend,red,Beast 2014 Wildebeast Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Light herb, green olive and earth aromas are followed by broad cranberry, cherry and orange peel flavors in this wine. It doesn't quite stand up on its own but should fit well at the dinner table."
US,90,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Eponymous 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"Rich in black cherry jam, mocha and toasty oak flavors, this wine offers the firm tannins and minerality that give a young Spring Mountain Cabernet its noticeable characteristics. Give it eight years to begin to come around."
US,89,30,White Blend,white,Las Positas 2014 Verdigris White (California),"This wine is dry and rather full bodied, starting with fruity aromas like banana and coconut then seguing to more nutty, oaky, complex flavors and a rich texture. It's a serious dinner wine with heft and substance."
France,87,25,Chardonnay,white,Domaine des Gandines 2014 Terroir de Clessé  (Viré-Clessé),"Full of the fresh acidity of the 2014 vintage, this light, bright wine has refreshing lemon and crisp apple flavors that are given richness by the lively acidity. Bursting with fruit, it is ready to drink now."
US,87,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Auclair 2014 96 Cedars Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas of barrel spice, dried green herb, dried fruit and game lead to quite sweet black-cherry flavors, with gamy notes on the finish. It seems a bit dried out."
US,91,25,Riesling,white,Boundary Breaks 2012 Single Clone No. 198 Reserve Riesling (Finger Lakes),"The floral spray and sweet nectar of fresh yellow cherries persist from start to finish on this penetrating semi-sweet wine. It's rich and ripe with stone fruit flavors, but balanced with tart lime acidity and steely, honed minerality."
Italy,90,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Carpineto 2009 Farnito Cabernet Sauvignon (Toscana),"Cedar, earth, black currant and underbrush aromas lead the nose on this wine made entirely with Cabernet Sauvignon. The smooth palate delivers black cherry, grilled herb and exotic spice alongside polished tannins."
Italy,90,38,Red Blend,red,Caiarossa 2011 Aria di Caiarossa Red (Toscana),"A blend of Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of blackberry, ripe plum, menthol, spice and a balsamic note. The dense, full-bodied palate doles out juicy black cherries, spiced blueberries, clove and licorice alongside chewy but fine-grained tannins."
US,92,40,Chardonnay,white,Ruby Hill Winery 2014 Jewel Collection Estate Reserve Chardonnay (Livermore Valley),"There is nothing shy about this full-bodied wine. It has overt spicy oak aromas and equally posh oak flavors, layered with crisp apple, lemon and pear nuances. The flavors range from nutmeg and cardamom to cream and vanilla and are balanced by a lightly tannic texture and lemony acidity."
US,82,13,Merlot,red,Arrow Creek 2007 Merlot (California),"Okay for everyday purposes, if you're at a party sipping the house wine from a paper cup. Dry and rugged, with blackberry and cherry flavors and a sharp finish."
US,88,45,Syrah,red,Nagy 2012 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Aromas of beach tar and blackberry jam show on the nose of this wine from White Hawk Vineyard by Clarissa Nagy, also winemaker at Riverbench. The palate is also quite tarry, with concentrated blackberry flavors, hints of teriyaki and a strong acidic backbone."
France,85,12,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château des Tourtes 2015 Duo Blanc  (Bordeaux Blanc),"The wine has mango aromas that set the scene for a tropical, richly fruity wine. Spice gives an extra frisson to this ripe wine. It has an exotic character that is unusual in this style of wine although it doesn't seem out of place or context. Drink now."
Italy,92,80,Red Blend,red,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi 2011 Mormoreto Red (Toscana),"Aromas of black currant, cedar, eucalyptus and dried Mediterranean herbs lead the nose of this full-bodied blend of 64% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot and 5% Merlot. On the structured but polished palate, notes of dark chocolate, black pepper and anise accent the juicy black cherry core. It's richly textured and balanced with velvety tannins."
US,84,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Morgan 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey),"With just a touch of oak, this is a pretty good Sauvignon Blanc. It's a little sweet in fig, citrus, passionfruit and melon flavors, but those Monterey acids are brisk and provide a clean balance."
France,88,10,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Calvet 1998 Reserve  (Bordeaux Blanc),"Attractive fragrance and a pleasureable mouthfeel characterize this medium-weight offering. A 50-50 Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc blend, it offers  pear, lemon, and vanilla-oak flavors on the nose and mouth. The long smooth finish is unexpectedly elegant, something not often found at this price. Best Buy."
US,86,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Inconceivable 2012 After the Floods Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Starting out reductive, this wine has aromas of wet copper penny, fresh herbs, woodspice and dark fruit. The coffee and black fruit flavors are high octane, seeming out of balance."
Italy,87,19,Pinot Grigio,white,Mezzacorona 2014 Riserva Pinot Grigio (Trentino),"This opens with delicate aromas of white peach, vanilla and toasted oak that carry over to the palate along with candied lemon drop and apple. Zesty acidity gives it a tangy finish."
US,89,18,Syrah,red,Balboa 2008 Mirage Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This nicely captures the complexity and earthiness of Washington Syrah, without becoming too heavy. Raspberry fruit is backed by earthy flavors and peppery herb, nicely integrated with nothing obtrusive. This is not the sweet and jammy style of Syrah you find in California, but it has a lot to offer if you give it a good look."
US,87,12,Chardonnay,white,River Road 2012 Un-Oaked Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"Shows pure, pleasurable Chardonnay flavors of white peach, grape, nectarine, honey and vanilla, with no interference from oak. The acidity gives the wine a slight bite. The winemaker did a good job assembling the various lots into this three-appellation blend."
France,86,29,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Les Vins de Vienne 2009 Rasteau Le Cancarot Red (Côtes du Rhône Villages),"This is dry and cedary upfront, with decent raspberry fruit emerging on the palate. It's medium bodied and lacks the richness and expansiveness of many 2009 Rhônes, but still offers a solid if somewhat oaky drinking experience."
US,86,17,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Cloudlift Cellars 2010 Updraft White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A white Bordeaux-style blend, crisp and edgy, with green fruit flavors sporting a citrusy kick. Young, tight and tart, it shows its alcohol on the angular finish."
France,89,60,Pinot Gris,white,Kuentz-Bas 2008 Grand Cru Eichberg Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Attractive mid-gold color. Fairly muted nose of very ripe stone fruit. Medium-bodied with moderate concentration of juicy citrus and sweet stone fruit flavors. Softish texture, smooth across the palate. Not very complex, but gentle and pleasing flavors. Medium length and fruity, honeyed finish."
US,85,15,Chardonnay,white,Raphael 2008 Grand Cru Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),"A medium bouquet of apple, lemon and a touch of fresh young peach. The oak is there but not overpowering. The palate is well structured with good acidity and a medium weight followed by a lengthy finish."
US,88,22,Chardonnay,white,Curtis 2012 Chardonnay (Santa Ynez Valley),"A touch of French oak brings a honeyed, vanilla smokiness to this wine, but the star really is the fruit. It's rich and forward with pineapples, peaches and mangoes, and made brilliant by crisp acidity. This is a good price for a Chardonnnay of this quality."
US,86,16,White Blend,white,Vina Robles 2009 White4 Huerhuero White (Paso Robles),"Lots to like in this creative blend of Vermentino, Verdelho, Viognier and Sauvignon Blanc. It's well acidified, with citrus, orange blossom, peach, apricot, buttercream and mineral flavors. Just a bit too sweet, though, with a sugary taste throughout."
Italy,87,19,Red Blend,red,Umberto Cesari 2011 Moma Red (Rubicone),There's a soft and plush side to this edition of Moma that comes forward thanks to the extra cinnamon spice and vanilla present on the bouquet. Red berry fruit and cherry add a note of freshness to the finish.
US,85,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Galvan 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"There are lots of rich, ripe blackberry, blueberry and chocolate flavors in this oaky wine, and the tannins are smooth. However, it's a bit soft and sugary sweet. Drink now."
US,91,27,Sangiovese,red,Covington 2012 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Boushey Vineyard makes up two-thirds of this wine, with the rest coming from Seven Hills. Fruit-forward aromas of cranberry, cherry, plum and spice lead to a thoroughly charming fruit-laden palate that shows a lot of purity. It's unabashed in its appeal."
Italy,86,14,Pinot Grigio,white,Pitars 2010 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Grave),This has a smooth structure and yellow fruit aromas. This wine also adds a grassy twist of dried herb or rosemary on the finish.
US,93,48,Pinot Noir,red,Flying Goat Cellars 2012 Rancho Santa Rosa Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Plump black plums and concentrated hibiscus fruit meet with cola, sarsaparilla and tart dried orange rind on the nose of this bottling. The palate is more earth-driven, with crushed rocks, pine needle and mint flavors spicing up the tart plum skins and berries. The texture is excitingly grippy."
France,87,10,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Cheval Quancard 2009 Chai de Bordes  (Bordeaux),"This is a fruity effort, with a blackberry note that is laced with attractive tannins and acids. With its smooth, ripe texture and full mouthfeel, this is already approachable."
US,89,32,Pinot Noir,red,Longoria 2012 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Here, Pinot Noir master Richard Longoria offers a more affordable taste of his Fe Ciega estate vineyard (whose other expressions cost upwards of $45 each). Aromas range from cranberry and tart blackberry to black pepper and wet slate, and the flavors hone in on sour cherry and tar. This wine features gripping tannins, so wait until 2016 for an even more optimal experience."
France,88,26,Chardonnay,white,Rijckaert 2015  Saint-Véran,"This ripe wine is already delicious with its full, bold fruits and peach and mango flavors. It's full of rich fruits and touched lightly by spice. Drink this generous wine from 2018."
US,87,35,Pinot Noir,red,Baxter 2009 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"There's lots of forward raspberry, cherry and pomegranate fruit in this soft, lush wine. Oak brings an additional layer of richness. It's delicious—like toast spread with butter and jam—but a little one-dimensional. However, it's a wonderful dimension to explore now."
France,91,44,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Delas Frères 2011 Haute Pierre Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"If it's possible for a Châteauneuf-du-Pape to have Burgundian style, this would be a candidate. The cherries are delicate and herbal, with crisp acids and silky tannins that provide a wiry, peppery framework for the elegant fruit. Drink now–2020."
US,92,50,Zinfandel,red,Renwood 2014 Jack Rabbit Flat Vineyard Zinfandel (Amador County),"Loads of ripe blackberry and boysenberry aromas lead to a plush, not quite soft mouthfeel laced with berry, cherry, clove and cinnamon flavors. It's a very generous, mouth-filling wine that will bring a lot of enjoyment."
US,90,48,Pinot Noir,red,Big Basin 2012 Alfaro Family Vineyards Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Black cherry fruit gets serious with elements of slate, eucalyptus, tar and wild mint on this wine from the Corralitos area at the southern coastal edge of the appellation. It's soft at first on the palate, then reveals a wash of acidity, with sour cherry fruit and black tea tannins."
US,87,36,Zinfandel,red,Kasuari 2005 Rose Knoll Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"This Zin is a little on the soft side, but it's very good, even charming in the way it flatters the palate with richness. Offers a burst of ripe blackberries, currants and pepper, wrapped into perfectly ripe Napa tannins. Drink now through 2010."
US,94,85,Merlot,red,Duckhorn 2005 Estate Grown Merlot (Napa Valley),"Deeply impressive on every level, from the profound, inviting aromas of currants and fine oak to the mouthfeel, which is plush and important. Encased in a superb structure of acidity and firm tannins are ripe, complex flavors of currants, violets, olive tapenade and oatmeal raisin cookies. Completely dry, this beautiful wine should age well for six years or more."
US,84,14,Pinot Noir,red,Old Soul 2013 Pinot Noir (Lodi),"Powerful spice and charred wood aromas and flavors dominate this full-bodied wine blended with 13% Zinfandel. It is quite unusual for the type, if tasty in its own way. Flavors resemble toasted bread, cloves and blackberry jam."
US,84,12,Pinot Noir,red,Castle Rock 2008 Pinot Noir (Napa County),"Simple and forward but good in varietal character, with the flavors of black cherry jelly, mint and cola. Finishes dry and crisp."
US,93,60,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Dominus 2012 Napanook Red (Napa Valley),"A blend of 95% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Petit Verdot, this soft, approachable wine from a storied producer is meant to enjoy young and yet exudes plenty of complexity. Luscious aromas of graham cracker and blueberry jam belie a classically balanced measure of integrated tannins and dark chocolate. Drink now through 2020."
Italy,86,22,Red Blend,red,Vignaioli del Morellino di Scansano 2009 Riserva Golden Boar  (Morellino di Scansano),"This straightforward Sangiovese-based wine conveys subdued aromas of blackberry, espresso and toasted notes. The palate is somewhat dilute but offers restrained red cherry and hints of white pepper alongside firm but fleeting tannins."
US,88,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Swiftwater Cellars 2010 Proprietary Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend is principally Cabernet Sauvignon, and offers forward, moderately light fruit flavors of strawberry and cherry. It's balanced and pleasant tasting, though lacking the depth that you might wish for in this price range."
US,90,65,Pinot Noir,red,FEL 2012 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a hearty, rich Pinot Noir from the famed Hirsch Vineyard, seductive and silky on the palate with dark, lingering black cherry fruit and layers of exotic spice. A core of earthiness defines the wine, its finish mid-length."
US,86,18,Pinot Noir,red,B.R. Cohn 2015 Pinot Noir (North Coast),"A buttery, plummy aroma, and flavors like cherry cobbler make this medium-bodied, dry wine attractive to sip. A rather firm texture keeps it appetizing."
US,88,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Sheldon 2012 D'Alliard Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Now for something completely different. Wild strawberry leads the way aromatically on this lean, high-toned Cabernet, lower in alcohol than most of its peers. The fruit is tight and structured, the wine angular and soft, with a seasoning of herb on the finish."
US,86,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Adler Fels 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"A rich, polished Sauvignon Blanc that's dry and spicy, with long, deep flavors of grilled pineapples, peaches, green apples and figs. Nice with charcuterie and onion rings."
US,84,70,Syrah,red,Emmolo 2006 South 40 Ranch Syrah (Napa Valley),"Soft and syrupy, with jammy black raspberry, anise and pepper flavors wrapped into firm, ripely sweet tannins. Ready now."
US,92,35,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Gård 2014 Vaucluse Lawrence Vineyards Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of Syrah (68%), Grenache (29%) and Viognier, this wine brings pungent, directly appealing aromas of smoked meat, blue fruit, black olive, orange peel and high-toned flowers. The blue and black-fruit and smoked-meat flavors are silky and well constructed with a finish that lingers."
Italy,91,29,Sangiovese,red,Fattoria Torre a Cona 2012 Terre di Cino Sangiovese (Toscana),"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of black-skinned fruit, underbrush and a whiff of menthol. The lithe palate offers black wild cherry, crushed raspberry and white pepper alongside firm but polished tannins."
US,88,45,Pinot Noir,red,Summerland 2009 Solomon Hills VIneyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This Pinot is rich and dense in rustic cherry and red currant flavors. It also feels quite warm in alcohol, which makes it almost taste like Grenache. Drink it over the next six years."
US,87,32,Chardonnay,white,Dutcher Crossing 2006 Stuhlmuller Vineyard Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),"Nothing subtle about this big, ripe, oaky Chardonnay. It shows the tropical fruit richness of a fine Alexander Valley Chard, flamboyant in pineapple custard flavor, with a flinty minerality. The sweet overlay of smoky oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume."
US,87,13,Sangiovese,red,Gargiulo 2000 Rosato di Sangiovese Sangiovese (Oakville),"Kicks off with pretty cherry notes in the nose. Dry and bright on the palate, the wine shows lovely ripe Bing cherry flavors, elegant citrus and clean mineral notes. A refreshing and satisfying rosé."
US,83,25,Riesling,white,Black Box 2014 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas of herbs, jasmine and peach are followed by off-dry pear and peach flavors. There's not much complexity here but it provides easy drinking enjoyment."
US,91,100,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Rarecat 2010 Old Toll Hillside Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga),"A full-bodied yet elegant wine, given added time in bottle, this shines in soft, firm tannins and vibrant black cherry, with a sensual trace of coconut and leather. Velvety on the palate, it gets better as it opens in the glass, taking on added complexity and intrigue."
US,92,40,Pinot Noir,red,Rusack 2013 Reserve Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Blistered cranberries, seared plums, slate, sandalwood and a whiff of pine forest pop on the nose of this bottling by Santa Barbara-raised winemaker Steve Gerbac. The palate bursts with energy, showing flavors of black sage, cherry, tart cranberry, pan-toasted herbs and cedar verve. The elements will focus and be even better 2017–2023."
US,86,37,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,The Calling 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Smoky and meaty, with decadent bacon notes, this wine is hugely built and concentrated, its black fruit deeply etched with cigar box and clove accents."
US,92,30,Merlot,red,Helix by Reininger 2005 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A beautiful evocation of Washington fruit, it has concentration, balance and structure, and the clean berry/cherry fruit is amplified by polished tannins, bright acids and light splashes of peppery spice. This is one of the finest pure Washington Merlots to be released in many years."
US,87,25,Pinot Noir,red,Plaisance Ranch 2014 Papa Joe's Private Stash Pinot Noir (Applegate Valley),"A bit lighter in 2014 than in past vintages, this puts an accent on light raspberry fruit, with a strong flavor of caraway seeds running down the spine. There's ample acidity, and a hint of fresh-baked bread."
France,91,37,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château la Bessane 2008  Margaux,"Potentially an aromatic wine that will develop a rich, velvety character. At this young stage, the fruit is dominated by firm tannins that sit at the heart of the wine. It has all the density for a good development, aging over 5–10 years."
US,91,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Salvestrin 2009 Salvestrin Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"This is a huge, extracted Cabernet Sauvignon. It's just what people expect Napa Cabernet to be: ripe, heady, oaky and bold. With deep, classy cassis, plum and chocolate flavors, it should develop additional nuances after 2017."
US,93,45,Zinfandel,red,Rock Wall 2013 Monte Rosso Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"This is a beautiful wine, fully expressive of the vineyard and vintage. It's showy in juicy red and black wild berries, with just-right additions of cinnamon and black pepper. Full bodied and concentrated, it remains approachable and an ideal companion to meaty fare."
US,88,15,White Blend,white,Pine Ridge 2015 White (California),This light-bodied wine has aromas like dried herbs and fresh celery that join vivid citrus flavors for a fresh and lively character that makes the mouth water. The mouthfeels gains breadth with each sip and the finish seems lightly sweet.
US,83,15,Red Blend,red,Tamayo 2006 Red (Contra Costa County),"Peppery and harsh, but fully dry, with a hot, angular mouthfeel framing flavors of berries and mint."
US,90,50,Chardonnay,white,Hearst Ranch 2014 Proprietor's Reserve Chardonnay (Central Coast),"This is the Hearst family's run at a luxury-level Chardonnay, and it's a promising start, with creamy aromas of honeysuckle, light butter and citrus rinds. There's a touch of vanilla bean on the palate, which also shows apple ice cream, flashes of cinnamon and a firmly wound texture. It's delicate, clean, light and quaffable."
France,92,40,Chardonnay,white,Joseph Drouhin 2012 Domaine Drouhin-Vaudon Sécher Premier Cru  (Chablis),"With the right intensity for a premier cru, this is a rich, lightly toasty wine. It has layers of chalky, mineral texture along with dense fruits and a sense of structure and potential. Drink from 2017."
US,85,28,Syrah,red,Kunin 1999 French Camp Vineyards Syrah (Paso Robles),"Fresh young cherry-berry aromas, with a kiss of oak, lead to extracted, jammy, full-bodied flavors that explode in the mouth. Soft, luscious and round, there's lots of immediate pleasure here."
France,87,20,Pinot Noir,red,Vignerons de Buxy 2015 Buissonnier  (Mercurey),"With judicious wood aging, this is a rich wine. Red berry and red-currant fruits dominate the acidity, giving a wine that is ripe and juicy. The aftertaste brings in attractive red cherries and acidity. Drink from 2017."
France,93,39,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Olivier 2009  Pessac-Léognan,"This has smooth, rich fruit, with sweet berries, ripe tannins and strong layers of wood. The wine is powerful; the stalky and bitter chocolate edge contrasts the sweet, ripe fruit. This is meant for long-term aging."
US,82,19,Merlot,red,Praxis 2007 Merlot (Alexander Valley),"A tough, green wine, with minty sharp acidity and not much fruit, although you'll find some modest cherry flavor."
US,96,80,Syrah,red,Cayuse 2010 En Chamberlin Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Iron and smoke accents wrap around densely-layered fruits with excellent concentration. It's gorgeous, deep and textured, with the focus on a rich raspberry and cherry core inside the frame of umami, leaf and seaweed."
US,85,38,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Due Vigne 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The texture on this Cabernet is rustic, with some tough tannins and green acidity, which lots of oak can't quite cover, but only add sweet toast. It's not a bad wine, but doesn't seem capable of aging, so drink up."
US,88,23,Syrah,red,Pech Merle 2015 Ivy Rosé of Syrah (Sonoma County),"This is a stainless-steel fermented combo of 90% Syrah with 10% Zinfandel. It's light and easy on the nose but dark in color and brooding in weight, made in a full-bodied style."
US,84,18,Zinfandel,red,Paso Creek 2006 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Tough, tannicly dry and gritty, this simple country Zin needs big barbecued beef or chicken dishes slathered with sweet BBQ sauce. It's packed with blackberry and cherry jam, blood orange, licorice, beef jerky and spice flavors."
US,89,42,Pinot Noir,red,MacRostie 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Fruit from the Cummings Vineyard and Thale's Vineyard is represented in this wine. A varietal expression of floral, fruity aromas and flavors, it's thick, concentrated and wrapped in smoky oak. Chocolate cherry makes it seem luxuriously ripe and lush."
US,87,22,Merlot,red,Harbes Family Vineyard 2014 Dry Rosé Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"Candied cherry and berry aromas abound on the nose of this dry rosé, but the palate is surprisingly elegant. Pristine red cherry and raspberry flavors are fresh and bright, accented by savory, slightly bitter hints that lend nuance to the finish."
Italy,87,64,Red Blend,red,Casa di Terra 2011 Mosaico  (Bolgheri),"Made from a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this dense wine features aromas of black plum, bell pepper, cedar, mocha and toasted oak. The palate is driven by very evident oak, chocolate, vanilla and concentrated, almost sugary, blackberry. The sweetness is broken up by an astringent, drying note of wood tannins."
US,88,16,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2014 Horse Heaven Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Horse Heaven Hills),"The herb, grapefruit, tropical fruit and melon aromas are light but very varietal. The palate has a slight spritz that perks up the tangy fruit flavors."
France,88,23,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Maison Noble 2016 Cuvée Maurice  (Bordeaux Blanc),"The 250-year history of the Moreau family is the story of wine: barrel-makers, winery suppliers, viticulturists, winemakers and négociants. The company is now directed by Frédéric Marque. Rich fruit and nutmeg flavors gives this wood-aged wine its ripe and fruity character. It offers zesty lemon and a delicious aftertaste of spiced apple and wood. Drink now."
US,82,30,Chardonnay,white,Biltmore Estate 2010 Château Reserve Méthode Champenoise Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (North Carolina),"Course and snappy on the palate, this blanc de blancs features broad apple flavors."
France,91,50,Chardonnay,white,Bret Brothers 2008 Domaine la Soufrandière Climat les Quarts  (Saint-Véran),"A great swathe of rich, well–defined fruit and a complex texture of pear and apple skins along with the freshest grapefruit and citrus character. This is an intense wine, the fruit fully in focus."
Italy,92,50,White Blend,white,Castello di Selvole 1996  Vin Santo del Chianti Classico,"This blend of 60% Malvasia and 40% Trebbiano boasts caramel, candied ginger and pine nut aromas. The concentrated, polished palate doles out candied apricot, maple syrup and toasted almond flavors, with a touch of carob."
Italy,89,48,Sangiovese,red,Molino di Sant'Antimo 2012 Varco 84  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Blue flower, ripe plum, baking spice and pine forest scents lead the nose. The palate is still tense and tightly drawn, showing tart sour cherry, star anise and a hint of espresso through flexed, fine-grained tannins that leave a firm finish. Drink after 2020."
US,93,32,Pinot Noir,red,Wait Cellars 2012 Devoto Garden Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"Light in ruby-red, see-through red color, it's spicy and alive, with a silky cherry pit aroma and undercurrent of herbal earthiness. Balanced and soft, it can accompany a slow-roasted pork tenderloin adorned in morel mushrooms or a classic BLT. Of course, it's also stellar on its own."
US,86,24,Pinot Noir,red,Three Saints 2009 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This tastes a little too high in acidity, but it does show the spiciness of Santa Maria Valley Pinot Noir. Flavors of ripe black cherry, peppercorn and licorice are all found, and it shows a nice silkiness. Drink now."
US,89,22,Red Blend,red,Foundry Vineyards 2011 Alla Prima Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though less expensive than the Artisan series releases from Foundry, the Alla Prima seems better balanced. There's less new oak (though 40% is not insubstantial) and the alcohol is well under 15%. The wine weaves together cherry, dark chocolate and espresso with plenty of tart acidity to buoy it up."
US,90,64,Zinfandel,red,McCay Cellars 2010 Contention Zinfandel (Lodi),"From old head-trained vines, Contention is McCay's top-of-the-line Westside Lodi Zin, a study in tight, dusty tannins and earthy acidity backed by a substantial layering of baking spices. Let this wine open a while to express itself fully."
US,94,47,Zinfandel,red,Carlisle 2015 Limerick Lane Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Floral and surprisingly bright, this wine is driven by sharply etched acidity and citrus—its flavors balanced and complementary. Red cherry and raspberry find companionship in seasonings of cinnamon and clove, the texture slightly leathery and bold."
US,82,13,Pinot Noir,red,Leese-Fitch 2010 Pinot Noir (California),"This wine is ripe in raspberry and cherry flavors, but it feels heavy. The sweetness and lack of structure make it taste like wine candy."
US,91,55,Pinot Noir,red,Kitá 2013 Hilliard Bruce Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Notes of hibiscus meet with red cherry, cola and cinnamon on this wine from a hilltop vineyard in the heart of the appellation. Intriguing chalky tannins frame the palate, where pomegranate and ripe cranberry flavors are leveled by a black-tea element."
US,87,28,Merlot,red,Helix by Reininger 2012 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas of green wood, vanilla and cola are followed by plump fruit flavors. The palate brings appeal but the aromas don't seem to match up."
US,83,10,Pinot Noir,red,Concannon 2010 Selected Vineyards Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"Soft and simple, with sweet, easy cherry and strawberry jam flavors and a silky texture."
France,85,18,Red Blend,red,Château de Brigue NV Rouge Héritage Red (Vin de France),"This is an earthy, rustic wine with tannins that set its black fruit firmly in place. Juicy acidity and black currant flavor give it a lift on the finish. Drink from 2018."
US,85,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Riboli 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"This is sharper and more rustic than most other expensive Rutherford Cabernets, with a cut of citrusy acidity that dominates the cherry and herb flavors. While it's tough and hard to appreciate now, you never know if these aggressive young wines will develop with time. This one doesn't seem like it will benefit, so drink up."
US,86,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Mosquito Fleet 2010 Plyley Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Despite a good effort at balancing this wine, the Pepper Bridge fruit was just at the green edge of ripeness in this vintage. The wine remains tart, sharp and herbal, with some chalkiness in the tannins."
US,83,28,Pinot Noir,red,Milliaire 2011 Pinot Noir (Mokelumne River),"This Lodi area Pinot Noir is fruit forward, particularly on the nose, though the lucious notes carry through on the palate as well, buoyed by oak."
France,93,34,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Le Crock 2014  Saint-Estèphe,"Owned by the Cuvelier family of Léoville Poyferré in Saint-Julien and with Michel Rolland as consultant, this is a fine estate with an equally fine chateau. It is dense and richly endowed with black fruits and spice. At the same time, it has style and a way with its fruit and acidity that give it a lift. Drink this very ageworthy wine from 2023."
US,87,52,Red Blend,red,Ledson 2008 Caudalies Reserve Red (Sonoma Valley),"Made from equal parts Zinfandel and Petite Sirah, this blend seems to detract from the purity of both. The result is interesting and even dramatic in ripeness, but a little muddied, with hard tannins making it tough despite a rich center of blackberry and cherry jam."
US,88,18,White Blend,white,Cor Cellars 2014 ALBA Gewüztraminer-Pinot Gris White (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"With the two varieties co-fermented in concrete, this has no oak to interfere with its aromas of spice, pear and honeysuckle. It drinks off dry, seeming a bit sweeter than recent vintages, but still bringing the acidity that this region is known for."
US,93,85,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Raymond 2012 District Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Another of the producer's 100% varietal wines designed to showcase a specific Napa Valley appellation, this one shines in juicy black licorice and dark cherry. Expansive on the palate, it's bright and minerality-driven, with a flourish of coconut and vanilla on the finish."
US,88,40,Pinot Noir,red,Phillips Hill 2011 Oppenlander Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino),"From a great vineyard, this Pinot is earthy and fairly robust in style, dry and balanced in acidity with a thick texture. Cherry and cranberry dominate in flavor and aroma, the wine aged 16 months in French oak, 25% new."
France,94,36,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Henri Bourgeois 2008 Le M.D. de Bourgeois  (Sancerre),"The initials refer to the vineyard of Mont Damné, the steepest vineyard in Sancerre. The wine reflects the stony character of the soil, coming through with great intensity. It is powerful, flinty, with a biting citrus character, deliciously taut and intense."
US,87,20,Zinfandel,red,Steiner Family Vineyards 2012 Free Bird Zinfandel (El Dorado),"Smooth and well balanced, this medium-bodied wine combines light cinnamon and cherry aromas with rich plum flavors. It has a good harmony between bright acidity and ripe fruitiness."
US,95,65,Chardonnay,white,Ramey 2012 Platt Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Not many producers get fruit from this magical vineyard, sought after for being cool, coastal and meticulously farmed. This wine speaks to all that, offering sublime Meyer lemon, pear and golden honey around a balanced soul and wild ginger-infused intensity."
US,90,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Seven Falls 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Wahluke Slope),"Aromas of vanilla, herb, cocoa and barrel spice lead the nose of this attractive Cab. The well-balanced palate offers coffee and dark fruit flavors that transition seamlessly into a lingering finish."
US,89,24,Zinfandel,red,Hovey 2011 Dragone Vineyard Zinfandel (Calaveras County),"Brick red in color, this toasty, oaky Zin is grippy and satisfying. Thick on the palate with sweet, ripe tannins and a dusty texture, it's nicely balanced with a long finish that's inviting with meaty foods."
Italy,91,80,Red Blend,red,Castello di Verrazzano 2006 Sassello Red (Toscana),"Sassello is an extremely well integrated wine with deep aromas of black cherry, forest berry, chocolate fudge and leather. The wine is sweet, succulent and round in the mouth with a slight alcoholic tug at the very end. Pair it with steak and green pepper cream sauce."
US,87,26,Syrah,red,Horan Estates 2005 CWN Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Stiffly tannic, this is straight-on boysenberry juice, firm and full-bodied. It shows a little bit of earthiness, hints of herb and a citrusy zip to the acids. The alcohol, pushing 15%, does not intrude."
US,90,22,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Silverado 2014 Miller Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Medium-crisp, this wine delights in stone fruit and lime zest, with a taste of fuzzy apricot dominant on the palate. Showing a balance of body and weight, it wraps things up with a layer of acidity."
Italy,92,74,Sangiovese,red,Paradiso di Frassina 2012 Moz Art  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Wild berry, Mediterranean brush, blue flower and aromatic herb aromas slowly take shape on this. The smooth juicy palate presents wild cherry, raspberry, licorice and nutmeg framed in polished refined tannins. Drink 2018–2027."
US,85,34,Zinfandel,red,Portalupi 2012 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"A curious streak of sarsaparilla marks this wine aromatically, followed by sparse, soft layers of black fruit and hidden black pepper."
US,91,55,Pinot Noir,red,Davis Family 2014 Starr Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a soft, smooth and earthy wine, still unraveling from its youth, that's crisp and fresh in acidity. Chewy still in texture, it offers a glorious celebration of red cherry, rhubarb, tea and clove."
US,93,42,Pinot Noir,red,Claiborne & Churchill 2014 Twin Creeks Estate Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Bright pomegranate and dried strawberry notes start the aromas on this bottling and then descend into more brooding cola, smoked herbs, cinnamon and spicy hibiscus. There is herbal and mineral depth to the palate, with raspberry, cranberry and pencil lead flavors that evolve toward fruit punch, thyme and earth. It's light in body but full of grippy texture."
US,89,21,Riesling,white,Savage Grace 2014 Underwood Mountain Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"Reserved green apple, lees, flower and mineral aromas lead to off-dry green apple and stone fruit flavors. The acidity gives the palate some snap."
US,94,50,Chardonnay,white,Gary Farrell 2012 Rochioli Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This flinty Chardonnay shares a full oak expression with a whiff of petrol, suggesting a decant or cellaring until 2016 to fully soften. It offers sublime lemon curd and minerally peach flavor amid tangy acidity and a bright finish. It displays a ying-yang between polish and power."
US,86,35,Sangiovese,red,Wise Villa 2013 Estate Grown Sangiovese (Placer County),"A strong oak influence dampens the varietal character in this full-bodied, spicy wine. It smells like cinnamon and cedar, tastes slightly sweet and smoky, is full bodied and rich in texture. Nice and smooth, it shows only mild varietal character."
US,87,19,Zinfandel,red,Shannon Ridge 2009 Ranch Collection Zinfandel (Lake County),"A full, fruity Zinfandel, with dusty tannins and structure. Its lingering finish is laced with notes of chocolate and vanilla. With 7% Petite Sirah mixed in, this would pair nicely with barbecue and other meaty dishes."
US,90,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Horse & Plow 2011 Preston Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),"This is a wonderful wine that's dryish and vital in acidity, with savory Meyer lemon, grapefruit, lemongrass, apricot and vanilla flavors. A touch of oak brings a buttered toast richness. Only 260 cases were produced."
Italy,93,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Castello di Monsanto 2004 Nemo Cabernet Sauvignon (Toscana),"The fine folks at Castello di Monsanto manage to always produce elegant and harmonious wines from Tuscany. This exceptional Cabernet Sauvignon shows remarkable quality both in terms of its flavor presentation and its territory-driven personality. The long fade is colored by blackberry, cherry and spice flavors."
France,86,11,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Roc de Ségur 2015  Bordeaux,"This is a fresh wine that has been aged in tanks, retaining its bright red fruits and lively acidity. It is still young although it will develop quickly to give a soft fruit-driven wine."
US,89,32,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Stinson 2013 Meritage Red (Monticello),"This wine is teeming with black fruit, cassis and sage. The palate is a complex and evolving accomplishment—bright black cherry and sage meld with earthy notes of cedar and tobacco, all framed by structured tannins. The finish is long and woody."
US,87,28,Sangiovese,red,Benessere 2009 Estate Sangiovese (Napa Valley),"Benessere has stuck with Sangiovese for many years. This is rich and fruity, and it offers jammy red-fruit, currant and chocolate flavors. Its smooth tannins and softness make it drinkable now."
France,95,50,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Doisy-Daëne 2005  Barsac,"Under the control of white wine wizard Denis Dubourdieu, this is one of the great wines of Barsac. It has intensity of sweetness, but just the right lightness, which gives it freshness as well as richness. This is a great wine in its early stages, and is certainly likely to age over many years."
US,95,75,Chardonnay,white,Keller Estate 2007 Precioso Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"An extraordinary Chardonnay whose complicated richness is balanced with tight acidity and a firm grounding of stony minerals. Brings to mind a great Chablis, with its zesty tang followed by elaborate layers of tropical fruits and pears. Utterly delicious, wildly appealing, a wine that will develop bottle interest over the next six years. Only 97 cases were produced."
US,85,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Blackstone 2007 Sonoma Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"A good everyday Cabernet with some aspirations to quality. Even though it's a little rugged and harsh in tannins, it's dry, with oak-inspired flavors of blackberries, black currants, cola and herbs. Drink now."
US,88,14,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Dachshund 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Full bodied, and firm textured, this wine emphasizes complexity and mouthfeel over simple fruitiness. It smells like ripe plums, tastes like cardamom and black cherry, and shows good balance between flavors, acidity and body."
France,94,39,Riesling,white,Kuentz-Bas 2015 Eichberg Grand Cru Trois Châteaux Riesling (Alsace),"A touch of freshly cut apple peel is all that appears on the shy nose. The palate is more approachable and opens into beautifully aromatic notions of ripe tart apples and blossom. This has a very harmonious balance and something like tender poise. This is absolutely fresh but it comes like a caress, touching and convincing with tenderness rather than flashy force. The palate is dry, has ample and aromatic apple fruit and immense charm. This is so easy to drink right now but will certainly evolve. It finishes with a long pure echo of lemon. Drink 2017–2027."
US,93,58,Pinot Noir,red,Dutton-Goldfield 2012 Fox Den Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"Elegant and well structured, this offers vibrant strawberry fruit wrapped around inviting aromatics of violet and spice. This cool-climate Pinot boasts a silky texture on the palate and finishes with subtle suggestions of wood smoke and cinnamon."
France,88,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château le Raz 2008  Montravel,"Just beginning its secondary phase, the wine has weight, dark tannins and complex dried fruit, licorice and spice. A stylish, elegant wine with some of the freshness of the vintage still in place."
US,91,50,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Rasa 2012 QED Convergence Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This blend features Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre and Viognier. The oak (30 months in 20% new French) is primary right now, with aromas of vanilla bean and coffee along with dark berry and thistle. It's supple in feel with a long finish. Additional time in the bottle should serve it well."
US,85,28,Zinfandel,red,Enkidu 2008 Bedrock Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"A very fruity, extracted Zin, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors that finish with a bite of acidity. Clean and easy to drink, it's a nice sipper with summer barbecue."
France,91,31,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Perrin & Fils 2009 Les Christins Red (Vacqueyras),"This can be a somewhat edgy wine, but the warmth of 2009 has softened it, imparting a rich, velvety texture and flavors of dried cherries, leather, cinnamon and clove. The long finish features a chocolaty note. Drink now–2025."
US,86,42,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Coho 2009 Headwaters Red (Napa Valley),"Toasty, caramelized oak dominates the aroma and flavor of this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend. It tastes soft and a little short of power."
US,92,45,Pinot Noir,red,Lost Canyon 2014 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Wafting baked bread aromas create a warm, inviting entry in this wine, which reveals medium-bodied layers of tart, tangy citrus, cranberry and pomegranate as it opens. High-toned yet deep, it offers balance and complexity and lingers on the finish."
US,87,38,Pinot Noir,red,Reustle 2008 Reserve Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"Reustle's Reserve Pinot Noir is sweetly scented with cherry fruit. It opens into a lightly herbal wine with streaks of clean earth, graphite and smoke to complement the cherries."
US,87,16,Chardonnay,white,Gordon Estate 2012 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a solid, all-purpose Chardonnay, a bit less oaky and oily than some previous efforts from Gordon, but showing firm, clean, ripe apple and pear fruit. The wine is balanced and smooth, delivering plenty of no-frills fruit flavor for the price."
US,90,28,Pinot Noir,red,San Saba 2006 San Saba Vineyard Pinot Noir (Monterey),"A very fine Pinot Noir that shows the crispness of its Central Coast origins, and also plenty of richness. Offers waves of cherries, red currants, cola and cedar, with a pleasantly stimulating bitterness. Drink this complex, food-friendly wine now and through 2011."
US,95,125,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Oakville East 2010 Core Stone Red (Oakville),"Based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this shows hard tannins and dryness despite the intensely ripe blackberries and cherries at its core. Two-thirds new French oak is not too much, adding balancing toast and wood tannins. This gorgeous wine will begin to come into its own by 2018, and should evolve for many more years."
US,90,29,Sangiovese,red,Helix by Reininger 2008 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Well-aged and drinking at a peak, this 100% Sangiovese is round and toasty, filled with plush cherry fruit, and just a smidgen of green olive. The barrel aging brings in accents of toasted walnuts through a full, inviting finish."
US,86,10,Pinot Grigio,white,McManis 2011 Pinot Grigio (California),"Refreshing and simple, this is dryish and spicy, with orange, apricot and peach flavors all accented with crisp acidity. It's easy to drink as a cocktail sipper, with little snacks, like tempura or cheesy puff pastries."
US,94,150,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Vine Cliff 2012 Private Stock 16 Rows Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"This small-production wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller percents of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Pencil lead, cedar and tobacco leaf greet on entry before soft yet generous layers of tannin swirl on the palate, informed by a depth of blackberry. A mix of savory and fruity, the finish is subtle in white pepper. Cellar through 2022."
US,90,36,Red Blend,red,MCV 2011 1105 Red (Paso Robles),"Based on Petite Sirah, with small amounts of Syrah and Grenache, this is a huge, fruity, extracted wine. It's explosive in raspberry and cherry jam flavor that's so ripe and pure, yet the finish is dry. The tannins are big and firm, making this wine perfect for a deliciously grilled steak, maybe finished with a Gorgonzola cheese sauce."
US,91,26,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Woodward Canyon 2013 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"From vines now a dozen years old, this unusual Walla Walla AVA Sauvignon Blanc is a brilliant straw color—aromatic with light scents of ripe grain and tangy fruits, and fills the mouth with delicious flavors of melon, white peach, lemon verbena and a dash of pepper. Complex and engaging, it finishes dry but leaves an impression of slight sweetness. Drink it slightly chilled."
France,90,34,Riesling,white,Domaine Allimant-Laugner 2009 Vendange Tardive Riesling (Alsace),"Notes of almonds and sweet fruit combine with steely acidity in this wine. It has both a bright, fresh character and honeyed smoothness. It is still quite youthful and could age well for 3–4 years."
France,92,124,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Faiveley 2014 Aux Chaignots Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),"This wine is smoky with hints of wood. The red-plum fruits are a little suppressed at the moment although the acidity and freshness hint at a good future. It has a cool character with plenty of acidity under the tannins. It will develop, but slowly. Drink from 2020."
US,92,60,Merlot,red,Quilceda Creek 1998 Merlot (Washington),"This extremely limited-production Merlot (about 250 cases) is Alex and Paul Golitzin's “other” great red. It's all Klipsun Vineyard fruit, 75% Merlot and 25% Cabernet, and its soft, chocolatey tannins envelope the taste buds in a sensual, textured landscape comprised of luscious cherry fruit and laced with hints of anise and roasted coffee. Big and extracted, yet more approachable than the Cabernet."
US,94,42,Pinot Noir,red,Hitching Post 2006 Cargasacchi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Has this vineyard ever produced anything less than a spectacular Pinot Noir? Hitching Post's '06 showcases its exotic spiciness and the way its power is modulated with an elegant structure. Cloves, nutmeg, allspice and white pepper are just a few of the spices that tantalize the cherry, orange and cola flavors. The wine feels wonderful in the mouth, rich and long-lasting. Ageable, too, with a window extending beyond 2012."
US,89,65,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Culton 2013 Mercenary Glenrose Vineyard Red (Paso Robles),"This blend of 50% Mourvèdre, 38% Syrah and 12% Grenache is fairly light on the nose, showing smoked beef, soy and black-plum paste. The flavors are also quite restrained, with leather, blackberry, fennel and wild-mint elements."
US,90,90,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,J. Davies 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"A generous expression of mountain Cab, accompanied by 14% Malbec, also estate-grown, this rich, soft wine is remarkable for its texture and mouthfeel, which is velvety and smooth. Peppercorn, dried herb and chocolate pronounce themselves on the palate, provoking thoughts for a similarly accented meal. Enjoy through 2021."
US,94,38,Syrah,red,Baker & Brain 2012 Le Mistral Syrah (Monterey County),"Violets, blackberries and espresso beans whirl together into a delicious, silky nose on this wine by Josh Baker and Matt Brain. It's similarly luxurious on the palate, soft and sensual with lots of boysenberry and olallieberry. It also shows a peppery licorice spice, boosted by focused acidity that enlivens every part of the tongue."
US,91,50,Pinot Noir,red,Hunt & Ryde 2014 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"In its second vintage, this wine is light and spicy, clearly made to be enjoyed with food. A collaborative effort between winemaker Guy Davis and proprietor/grapegrower and chef Guy Fieri, it shines in subtly toasty oak, cinnamon and dark cherry flavors, with a lingering lushness on the finish."
France,85,65,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Roullet 2010  Canon-Fronsac,"This is an enormous wine, maybe too much. With its layers of rich black fruits and dark tannins, it is a powerful, juicy, jammy and super-ripe wine. It all seems excessive and out of balance. It's fun for a moment, but not for drinking with food."
US,86,35,Chardonnay,white,Lake Sonoma 2012 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"It has a creamy texture and rich flavors of honey, peaches, oranges and tropical fruits. Although it's a little on the soft side, it's easy to drink."
Italy,88,30,Sangiovese,red,Agricola Querciabella 2007 Querciabella  (Chianti Classico),Jammy fruit and strawberry aromas characterize the nose of this chewy Chianti Classico. You'll appreciate the juicy softness and velvety qualities it imparts in the mouth.
France,87,33,Chardonnay,white,Seguin-Manuel 2013  Pouilly-Fuissé,"A fruity, apple-driven wine, this has a creamy texture. It is soft, lightly spicy and with delicious acidity. The wine is fruity, fragrant and refreshing. Drink now, reveling in the fruit."
France,87,25,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Louis Bernard 2011 Les Carbonnières  (Gigondas),"This starts off with scents of ripe black cherries and dried herbs, then turns more chocolaty in flavor on the palate. It's full bodied without being particularly textured, and shows some coarse tannins on the finish. Drink now–2015."
US,91,52,Pinot Noir,red,Arista 2010 Perli Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge),"Thick and foresty, this Pinot Noir embodies the extremes of the Perli Vineyard. It bursts with dark blue and earthy red fruits that are tempered by a savory undertone. This wine takes time to reveal itself, so age it for 5–7 years, and pair it with stews, risottos or seasoned braised lamb."
US,86,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,O•S Winery 2009 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Bordeaux-style blend remains a fair value, showing some sweet barrel spices along with opening fruit flavors of red and black berry. It thins out in the middle and finishes with a simple, fruity flourish."
US,89,24,Syrah,red,Serena's Vineyard 2010 Private Reserve Syrah (Paso Robles),"Soy, black fruit and asphalt aromas are strong on the nose of this wine by the Four Sisters project. The palate is varietally pure, with black pepper, tar and boysenberry. It dives a bit deeper as well, showing coffee and dark chocolate character."
US,90,21,Pinot Noir,red,Panache Cellars 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This fragrant wine from an excellent vintage offers terrific value. Silky and potent, it features mixed flavors of berries, cherries, cola and mocha, with a dash of white pepper."
US,88,13,Riesling,white,Fenestra 2006 White Riesling (Arroyo Seco),"This stone-soil, cool-climate region of Monterey is the perfect place to grow a German-style Riesling and keep the price down, because costs there aren't as high as in the North and South coasts. The wine is brilliantly crisp and off-dry, with savory honeysuckle, citrus, apple and mineral flavors, with even richer suggestions of tropical fruits."
US,86,28,Merlot,red,Truchard 2004 Merlot (Carneros),"Very ripe, even superripe, with pie-filling currant, cherry and plum flavors that approach raisin. With its soft texture and smooth tannins, the wine is voluptuous. Drink now."
US,92,165,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Beaulieu Vineyard 2013 Reserve Clone 6 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Yeasty in baked bread aromas with an integrated framework of soft tannin and oak, this clone designate offers bright acidity amidst a ripeness of red currant and plum. Coffee flavor and tobacco give it an additional complexity of savory tension."
US,86,28,Pinot Noir,red,Saint Gregory 2012 Reserve Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Full body, a broad texture and very ripe flavors give both heft and softness to this cedar- and brown-sugar-scented wine. The ample fruit flavors taste mature and fully ripe, like dried plums."
France,85,30,Chardonnay,white,Château Philippe-le-Hardi 2012 Clos Philippe-le-Hardi  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Beaune),"An attractively fruity wine, it has apple flavors cut with lime juice. Bright, crisp and laced with acidity, it could age but is already delicious to drink."
Italy,86,12,Chardonnay,white,Tormaresca 2007 Chardonnay (Puglia),"Here's a light and easy Chardonnay with clean mineral notes backed by dried hay, sage, stone fruit and honey. The wine has good density and length and ends on a spicy, fresh note."
US,93,60,Chardonnay,white,Arista 2013 Ritchie Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"An opulent nose surges from the bottle in this lush, exuberant wine from the legendary vineyard site. Pronounced flavors of baked apple, caramel, honey and peach combine in memorable, full-bodied ways. Textured and layered, this brooder is drinking great now but should do well with more time in the cellar, through 2023."
Italy,87,18,Red Blend,red,Barberani 2010 Foresco Red (Umbria),"This blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon opens with aromas of evident oak, saw dust and blackberry. The palate delivers ripe black cherry, black currant and raisin flavors, with accents of white pepper and clove."
US,87,39,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Guardian 2014 Gun Metal Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is 53% Cabernet Sauvignon and 47% Merlot. The aromas are light, with notes of blue fruit, ripe red apple, herb and barrel spice. The palate is medium bodied, with a tart uplift on the finish."
US,86,18,Pinot Gris,white,Goose Ridge 2012 Rosé de Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though no residual sugar is listed, this appears to have a hint of sweetness, along with light fruit flavors of strawberry and candied cherries."
US,92,48,Merlot,red,Switchback Ridge 1999 Peterson Family Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"Kicks off with gobs of chocolate and spice aromas, then fans out to reveal layers of black currant, blackberry, coffee, herb and spice flavors. A touch of acidity accentuates the tannins, but the wine is richly textured, full bodied and delightful nonetheless. Full, ripe and distinctive."
US,94,40,Chardonnay,white,Liquid Farm 2014 La Hermana Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"This is one of the most exciting wines of the vintage for this label, a blend of 68% Bien Nacido and 32% from its sister vineyard, Solomon Hills. It shows Meyer lemon pith, chalk, pencil lead, grapefruit pith and a slight touch of yogurt on the nose. The chalk-driven, tingling-with-acidity palate opens onto brine-laced flavors of yellow grapefruit pith and expertly restrained pineapple and peach."
France,86,30,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Philippe Girard 2014 Cuvée Silex  (Sancerre),"This rounded wine is still tight and closed. The texture shows strongly at the moment, but will soften to bring out the crisp fruits and perfumed acidity. A rustic edge needs to blow away as the wine matures. Drink from 2017."
US,90,25,Chardonnay,white,14 Hands 2014 The Reserve Chardonnay (Horse Heaven Hills),"This wine is made in a full-throttle style, with aromas of toast, melted butter, spice and vanilla—the latter from the 100% new American oak aging. It's creamy in feel, with citrus and stone-fruit flavors on the finish. The barrel influence is a bit obvious but it's hard to deny its appeal."
US,93,49,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,V. Sattui 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"This 100% Cabernet shows the deeply concentrated fruit and powerful yet refined tannins of Mount Veeder. It's packed with black-berries and black currants, with plenty of new French oak. Flashy, but needs time. Should easily unfold over the next 8–9 years."
US,93,50,Syrah,red,Jaffurs 2014 Larger Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"There's a warm and welcoming note of baked goods and toasty brioche on the nose of this bottling, along with hints of vanilla and black cherry. The flavors are also very accessible and delicious, with black-cherry syrup, maple, brown sugar and more vanilla spice that carries deep into the finish. The tannins are firm enough to hold up the richness."
US,87,37,Pinot Noir,red,Chalone Vineyard 2010 Estate Pinot Noir (Chalone),"Red cherry, red currant, mushroom and sandalwood flavors mark this appealing wine. Bone dry, with good acidity, it's a fine wine to drink now, but it should also age for quite some time, without necessarily gaining in complexity."
US,87,20,Merlot,red,Abacela 2009 Merlot (Southern Oregon),"Though labeled merlot, this is truly a Bordeaux-style blend with Cabernet Sauvignon (6%), Malbec (5%), and Petit Verdot (2%) added to the mix. It is reserved in style with notes of cherry, dried herbs and pickling spices backed by firm, dry tannins."
US,94,35,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Coquelicot 2008 Sixer Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"This wine is dry and crisp and enormously complex. It flatters the palate with waves of blackberries, cherries, currants, tangerines, bacon, white pepper and sweet vanilla oak, and the all-important tannin structure is fine. It's 94% Syrah, while 6% Viognier brings the perfect bite of acidity and citrus."
Italy,90,20,Red Blend,red,Feudo Principi di Butera 2012 Symposio Red (Terre Siciliane),"A blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot, this bold wine features aromas of spiced plum, blackcurrant, leather and a hint of coconut. On the palate, assertive tannins support the mature blackberry, espresso and licorice flavors."
US,94,115,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Spoto 2010 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"This is an awesome wine that's rich and dramatically layered, with smooth Oakville tannins and a fine jacket of acidity. It's upfront and concentrated, calling attention to its layers of blackberry, cassis, mocha, anise and sweet oak. Beautiful now, but it will continue to develop additional complexities over the next 10 years. Spoto has dramatically upped its game with this release."
Italy,86,21,Red Blend,red,Fattoria La Vialla 2014 LeccioMoro  (Montecucco),"You'll find subdued aromas of leather, red currant and forest floor on this blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot. The simple palate delivers mature plum and toast offset by drying tannins. Drink soon."
US,90,34,Red Blend,red,Fielding Hills 2013 Tribute Estate Riverbend Vineyard Red (Wahluke Slope),"Aromas of vanilla, coconut, barrel spice and dark fruit are followed by plentiful black-fruit flavors. It brings a lot of appeal, mixing fruit and barrel."
US,88,59,Pinot Noir,red,Acacia 2014 Lone Tree Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Soft, supple and floral, this wine is full-bodied and moderately structured, offering bold swathes of compost, sage and cola spice."
France,89,30,White Blend,white,Domaine d'Alzipratu 2015 Pumonte White,"This ripe wine offers yellow fruit and a generous texture. A touch of pepper accompanies the acidity, fruits and full-bodied structure. Drink this rich wine from 2017."
US,92,125,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,O'Brien 2006 Unrestrained Reserve Red (Napa Valley),"Lush and delicious, if a little soft, with palate-flattering flavors of black currants, milk chocolate and cedar, and sweet herbs like dill and sage. Very smooth and seductive. Doesn't seem to have the structure for aging, but an elegant wine for now."
US,93,40,Pinot Noir,red,Phillips Hill 2013 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Sometimes a blend of vineyards like this one can equal or surpass the single-vineyard bottlings. This complex and well-rounded wine achieves a good balance between seductive fruit flavors and more subtle, woodsy, savory nuances from whole-cluster fermentation, while not going over-the-top in body or oakiness. Each sip uncovers more spice, more cedar and more subtlety."
US,93,35,Pinot Noir,red,WesMar 2007 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Dry, silky and complex, this Pinot is as good as WesMar's more costly single-vineyard Pinots, which makes it a great value. It shows great structural integrity, with crisp acids and fine tannins that house exotic flavors of cherry compote, Dr. Pepper cola, orange zest, Canadian bacon and Asian spices. Now–2013."
US,92,24,Zinfandel,red,Bodkin 2014 The Hill and the Vale Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Co-fermented with 10% Petite Sirah, this red certainly impresses. With a fruity entry, it meets a leathery tightness on the midpalate, its mix of cherry and orange confounding expectations of darker expression from the varieties with its rose-tinged aromas. Spicy pepper rounds out the finish."
France,93,140,Pinot Noir,red,Jean-Claude Boisset 2011 Les Charmes Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),"While soft and opulent initially, this wine reveals a structured, mineral character on the palate. Ripe red cherry and black plum flavors pair well with firm, dry tannins and hints of wood aging. This is an elegant wine that needs aging. Don't drink before 2017."
US,86,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Greenwood Ridge 2012 HundredPoint Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino Ridge),"Not exactly worth 100 points as the label implies, but this wine is ripe and full flavored, smooth on the palate and almost soft in texture. It is medium bodied and very drinkable."
US,88,11,Riesling,white,Pacific Rim 2014 Dry Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),Aromas of white peach and apple lead to bone-dry fruit flavors. It provides a lot of appeal.
US,88,20,Pinot Noir,red,Alma de Cattleya 2016 Alma de Cattleya Rose of Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"Intriguing on the nose, this bottling shows raspberry, dried orange peel and dusty, crushed slate aromas. The palate is dominated by wet river stone and chalky minerality that frame the soft pink-fruit flavors."
US,93,48,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Gramercy 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"You can almost just smell this wine and be completely satisfied: its earth, black currant, flower, vanilla and sandalwood aromas are so intoxicating. A further venture, however, is rewarded. The dark fruit flavors are dense and full yet still fresh and lively with a finish that sails. It's a compelling example of Washington Cabernet that drinks beautifully now, but a few years (or more) in the cellar will be rewarded as well."
US,83,8,Pinot Grigio,white,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2013 Pinot Grigio (California),"Here's a clean, dry, light-bodied white wine with green-apple and celery aromas and flavors that are very mild. The first sip is crisp and refreshing, and it turns softer and leaner on the finish."
US,87,28,Chardonnay,white,Darms Lane 2010 Chardonnay (Oak Knoll District),"Shows plenty of ripe pineapple, peach and pear flavors, enhanced with toasty vanilla and oak; rounded out with clean acidity. It's solidly in the modern California style."
US,89,47,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Blue Rock 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Soft and herbal but quite delicious, this Cab offers flavors of blackberries, black currants and mocha, with a rich veneer of sandalwood. At its best now and through 2012."
US,88,14,Chardonnay,white,Wine by Joe 2015 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This brings a pleasing mix of apple, melon and peach fruit, with a good grip and moderate length. It's a fine all-purpose Oregon Chardonnay, widely available at a wallet-friendly price."
US,91,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Vineyard 7&8 2009 7 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"It's soft and gentle in texture, yet richly tannic, with complex blackberry, black currant, herb and cedar flavors. It shows the classic elegance that's characteristic of this mountain vineyard site. Drink over the next 3–4 years."
US,86,17,Chardonnay,white,William Hill Estate 2015 Chardonnay (North Coast),"Vanilla aromas and sweet butter and baked apple flavors make this medium-bodied wine appealing and easy to enjoy. The acidity is very light, and the texture soft."
US,93,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Gallo Signature Series 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"With this new line, Gallo once again strives to redefine itself, with positive results. Bearing Gina Gallo's signature, it's a fine Cabernet, soft, dry and complex, with flavors of blackberry, black currant and cedar. The structure is all about Napa Valley, showing ripe, smooth tannins and a good bite of acidity. Really a superior Cab, one to drink now and over the next six years."
US,84,12,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Curtis 1999 Heritage Cuvee Red (Central Coast),"Smells rustic, with dried herb aromas, like sage and oregano although there are some pretty blueberry and black cherry flavors. There's also a tart, acidic streak that persists into the finish, and it's very dry. A Rhône-style blend of Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre and Counoise. —S.H."
US,90,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Januik 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"This wine combines fruit from Ciel du Cheval, Obelisco, and Shaw vineyards. The aromas suggest fresh plum, gun smoke, herb, flower, vanilla, cinnamon and spice. The flavors are soft and supple, with tannins combed to a fine sheen."
US,87,39,Syrah,red,Matthews Estate 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Solid Syrah character is evident—pomegranate, wild berry, and gamy streaks of soy and earth and peppery spice woven into the flavors. Light chocolate adds interest to the finish, but some chalkiness (from unintegrated acids?) detracts from the finish."
US,96,275,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Patrimony 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Adelaida District),"Extremely dark in the glass, this tremendous effort by the Daou brothers was nine years in the making, and it shows. Dense aromas of crushed lilacs, chocolate chips, soy and dark purple fruits come through with power on the nose. The palate is soft and supple in structure, offering flavors of blueberry, cocoa, pepper, graphite and candied fruit. The tannins remain a tad sticky, so drink 2018–2033."
Italy,89,25,Red Blend,red,Pietro Beconcini 2013 Riserva  (Chianti),"Made of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Canaiolo, this opens with violet and leather aromas. The savory, straightforward palate offers mature black cherry, sage and anise flavors, supported by lithe tannins. Enjoy through 2020."
US,92,32,Red Blend,red,Mark Ryan 2011 The Dissident Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromatic with streaks of truffle, cigar and black cherry, this lively six-grape blend is principally Red Mountain fruit, along with some from Red Willow. Substantial and mouth-filling wine, it's nuanced with rich flavors of cassis, tar, graphite and chalk. It spent 18 months in barrel, 73% new."
US,90,42,Pinot Noir,red,Bergström 2015 Cumberland Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Still knitting itself together, this entry-level cuvée from Bergström brings fresh raspberry fruit flavors front and center. There are toasty highlights as well, nicely framing the finish, promising further development in bottle after 2018."
Italy,88,25,Red Blend,red,Nottola 2011  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,"Round and rich, this blend of Sangiovese and 20% Merlot opens with aromas of dark berry and underbrush. The ripe, straightforward palate delivers black plum, crushed black cherry, coffee and a chocolate note while soft tannins make it extremely accessible. Enjoy through 2016."
US,96,60,Syrah,red,Zaca Mesa 2009 Black Bear Block Estate Grown and Bottled Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"If the first duty of a wine is to be delicious, this tiny production bottling succeeds beyond all measure. The Black Bear Block is almost always Zaca Mesa's best Syrah among its many releases, and so it is again in 2009. Take one sip and you're dazzled by the refined tannins, dryness and complexity of flavors: blackberry, cassis, plum sauce, mocha, bacon, smoky oak, white pepper, chamomile tea and licorice. What's harder to express is the sheer pleasure of the mouthfeel. This is an exciting Syrah, and may just be at the beginning of a long journey. Drink now and for many years as it slowly changes."
France,84,16,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Florent Descombe NV Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de France),"Simple and fruity yet lacking in acidity, this is a soft style of Cabernet Sauvignon. It's fruity, with strawberry jelly flavor, and should be drunk immediately."
US,90,24,Chardonnay,white,Schug 2008 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"A wonderfully drinkable Chardonnay that shows brilliant coastal character and lots of richness, at a decent price. Crisp and dry, it has elaborate flavors of pineapples, green apples, peaches, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla and cinnamon spice."
US,91,42,Syrah,red,Solminer 2015 Nebulite Sparkling Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"One of the few sparkling Syrahs available anywhere in America, this is a very tasty and vibrant wine. Aromas of blackberry, pepper, chipped slate, soil and herbs show on the frothy nose. The palate plays to the grape's tart side, with underripe boysenberry and elderberry flavors that are cut by the racy acidity and persistent bubbles."
US,88,22,Chardonnay,white,Anam Cara 2013 Nicholas Estate Chardonnay (Chehalem Mountains),"This unoaked, Dijon-clone wine is lively and lush, with tongue-coating fruit. Melon, banana and papaya flavors steer it in a tropical direction, with a lick of mineral and phenolic bite giving further support."
Italy,88,30,Red Blend,red,Cantina Valpolicella Negrar 2012 La Tirela  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"Aromas of baked plum, cake spice and a whiff of dried herb lead the way. The palate is straightforward by Amarone standards, offering dried black cherry, nutmeg and a hint of licorice alongside close-grained tannins that leave a drying finish."
Italy,89,28,White Blend,white,Decugnano dei Barbi 2014  Orvieto Classico Superiore,"Aromas of apple, crushed stone and thyme come together on this vibrant white. The medium-bodied palate offers green pear, juicy nectarine, dried herb and flinty mineral alongside lively acidity. A note of bitter almond fills in the finish."
France,92,135,Pinot Noir,red,Bouchard Père & Fils 2008 Les Cailles Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),"A firm wine from a cool vineyard. It is structured, dry and solid, the fruit dominated by tannins. There is an austere character here that obviously needs time to fill out. Give it five years."
US,85,28,Pinot Noir,red,Lola 2011 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This easy-drinking Pinot Noir offers layers of softened cola, pomegranates, red licorice and pepper, wrapped into supple tannins. It's ready to drink now with everything from tuna tartare to roasted salmon and grilled burgers."
US,89,30,Red Blend,red,Brian Carter Cellars 2005 L'Etalon Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Young, tight and sharp, showing lots of black currant, along with pepper and spice. Maybe just a notch below the excellent 2004 L'Etalon Red. Tasted twice over a six month period, the wine remains stubbornly tough and chewy, despite appealing chocolaty spice and penetrating raspberry and currant fruit."
France,88,28,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine Laporte 2014 Les Duchesses  (Pouilly-Fumé),"This is an attractive, perfumed wine that has fresh acidity and a crisply herbal flavor. It's bright with tangy citrus and refreshing, delicate apple and grapefruit flavors. The aftertaste is all fruit."
US,93,32,Chardonnay,white,Donkey & Goat 2014 Linda Vista Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"After making wine in Berkeley for just over a decade, the producer is working for the first time with Napa Valley fruit, grapes in fact farmed by grape-grower extraordinaire Steve Matthiasson. Pear, quince and grapefruit combine for a svelte sensibility, subtle in oak and sharp in acidity, with a tangy, herbal finish."
US,93,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Alder Ridge 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"Young, supple and stylish, this mixes notes of berry, plum and cassis, demonstrating poise and richness. The barrel flavors are smoothly integrated; the finish is rich and dark, with a strong streak of cacao."
France,89,29,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine Daniel Reverdy et Fils 2014 Anthéa  (Sancerre),"This limited-production wine is still tight and not yet revealing its full potential. As it develops over the next few months, it will show its flavors of ripe red apples and an intense texture. The wine is full bodied while remaining crisp. Give it until 2017 before drinking."
Italy,88,100,Sangiovese,red,Val di Suga 2009 Vigna del Lago Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Aromas suggest underbrush, scorched soil, stewed black fruit, pressed rose petal and a whiff of game. The warm palate offers steeped prune, fig, grilled herb and a leathery note alongside the heat of evident alcohol. Drink 2016–2021."
US,94,45,Pinot Noir,red,Styring 2012 Estate Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"The totally delicious fruit offers immense flavors of black cherries and cassis, along with streaks of cola, coffee and chocolate syrup. It's a luscious, beautifully balanced wine with a long and thoroughly delicious finish."
US,87,48,Pinot Noir,red,CULT 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Marked by extreme ripeness, this Pinot is a blast of red cherry pie filling, red licorice and cola flavors, with a smoky note of bacon fat. Delicious, but a bit soft and simple in texture."
US,98,55,Syrah,red,Gramercy 2010 Lagniappe Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Sourced from Red Willow, Olsen and Les Collines, this is the finest effort yet from Gramercy Cellars and one of the greatest Syrahs ever produced in Washington state. Think Hermitage with brighter fruit. It's intensely aromatic, dense and seamless, stacked with rich flavors of mixed berries, layers of smoke, earth and herb, and punctuated by citrusy acidity. Highlights of oranges and tangerines sneak into the finish, which lingers for an astonishingly long time. Exceptional in every way."
Italy,92,90,Sangiovese,red,Lambardi 2010  Brunello di Montalcino,"Classic Sangiovese aromas of underbrush, pressed powder, violet and wild berry mingle in the glass. The vibrant palate offers layers of black cherry, dried red cherry, white pepper, truffle and savory herb alongside firm but refined tannins and bright acidity. This is all about polish and finesse. Drink 2018–2028."
US,87,38,Pinot Noir,red,Ten Acre 2011 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a sound Pinot Noir, well-made and clean, with some complexity. It's your basic Russian River Valley, dry and crisp in acidity, with pleasant cola, red currant, cranberry and pomegranate flavors. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink up."
US,91,95,Pinot Noir,red,Etude 2013 Heirloom Grace Benoist Ranch Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Made from a selection of heirloom vines, this dense, concentrated wine opens in the glass to take on lighter, more delicate waves of pomegranate and cranberry. The oak is present but never overbearing, providing structure around an ashy finish."
France,95,90,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Domaine de Chevalier 2009  Pessac-Léognan,"Dominating aromas of smoky new wood follow through to the toasty flavor that covers the fruit at this stage. But, like all 2009s, this is a rich wine that will balance out and show all of its opulence. That said, it will likely always be a firm, ageworthy wine, with the dark tannins always in evidence."
Italy,84,15,Riesling,white,Lechthaler 2012 Drago Riesling (Trentino),"From Trentino in northern Italy, this Riesling has delicate aromas of acacia flower, honey and pear. The lean palate shows hints of beeswax, honey and tropical fruit flavors that finish abruptly."
France,86,18,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Les Parcelles de Stéphane Derenoncourt 2011  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"This wine has a smoky character and a subtle touch of wood, along with firm tannins and red fruits. Age this for 1–2 years."
France,86,18,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Carignan 2014 L'Orangerie de Carignan  (Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux),"The second wine of Château Carignan is ripe and fruity. It has red fruits and layers of tannin and acidity. It is a young attractive wine that will be ready to drink soon, certainly from 2017."
Italy,89,20,Sangiovese,red,Mazzei 2011 Belguardo Bronzone Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano),"Purple flowers, ripe berry and tobacco aromas lead the nose on this Sangiovese-based wine. On the smooth, concentrated palate, notes of black pepper, anise and clove accent the core of fleshy black cherry. Velvety tannins provide support. Drink 2016–2020."
US,87,28,Red Blend,red,Sarah's Vineyard 2012 Synfandel Red (Santa Clara Valley),"The nose on this blend of Zinfandel and Syrah is a bit shy, with a touch of baked red cherry and hot asphalt. The palate is more intriguing, with stewed red cranberry, anise, brioche and cinnamon."
US,87,70,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Madrigal 2012 Sonnet #63 Red (Napa Valley),"Tight tannins support a blend of 49% Cabernet Sauvignon with 21% Petit Verdot, 11% Merlot and 9% Cabernet Franc. Black fruit, tobacco and leather give it a robust profile, finishing full bodied and ripe."
Italy,88,40,Red Blend,red,Brancaia 2011 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"This blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot commences with aromas of black plum, green bell pepper, blue flower and balsamic notes. The juicy palate delivers a core of black cherry along with black pepper, espresso and chocolate. Still tightly tannic, it also shows the warmth of the vintage. Drink 2015–2018."
US,85,14,Pinot Gris,white,Balletto 2006 Pinot Gris (Russian River Valley),"Crisp and on the sweet side, this PG has flavors of honey, lemons, limes, green apples, figs and peppery spices. Nice as a cocktail sipper. Try with Chinese food for something different."
US,91,50,Zinfandel,red,Robert Biale 2013 Old Kraft Vineyard Zinfandel (St. Helena),"From an historic site replanted and restored to new heights, this wine has good grip and high-octane fruit that plays on the palate, veering from jammy to juicy and back again. Anise and black pepper linger on the lengthy finish, with a touch of smoky oak and toffee."
US,87,13,Merlot,red,Francis Berwyn 2006 Merlot (Paso Robles),"A lovely Merlot and, at this price, a compelling buy. Hard to find a better inexpensive all-around full-bodied red than this one. Fully dry, it has polished flavors of cherries, currants, anise and pepper, wrapped in a gentle, silky texture."
US,90,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Voss 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"A beautiful Sauvignon Blanc, dry and crisp and low in alcohol. With no oak to interfere, it shows vibrant citrus fruit, guava, lemongrass and mineral flavors, balanced with zesty acidity. A beautiful, racy wine."
Italy,88,50,Sangiovese,red,Collelceto 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,"The nose unfolds shyly, revealing black-skinned fruit and baking spice aromas. The palate evokes mature flavors like dried blackberry, tobacco and toast, held together by close-grained tannins. It's rather evolved so drink soon."
US,93,35,Chardonnay,white,Center of Effort 2014 Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"Though golden-hued in the glass, this is rather mellow on the nose, with soft lemon cream, toasted apple and marzipan aromas. The palate shows intense acidic energy, with zippy, tight and clean nectarine sorbet and Meyer lemon rind flavors."
US,90,49,Pinot Noir,red,Roadhouse Winery 2012 Pink Label Martini Clone Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Lightly colored and tightly wound, this wine offers a bouquet of rose petals around a core of cherry and cranberry with buoyant acidity. A low oak profile helps boost the fruit-forwardness and approachability of the wine, with just a tiny bite of tannin on the finish."
US,89,60,Merlot,red,Bolen 2007 Merlot (Oak Knoll District),"Delicious in flavor, with fresh, ripe blackberry and cherry flavors, while the oak overlay adds richer layers of sweet caramel and buttered cinnamon toast. A crisp spine of citrusy acidity adds brightness. An appealing Merlot for drinking now."
US,86,26,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,R2 2010 Rhapsody En Blu Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"Made from Grenache and Mourvèdre, this is a soft, gently polished wine that's rich and sweet in cherry pie, mocha and spice flavors, with a touch of smoky oak."
US,94,65,Chardonnay,white,Williams Selyem 2011 Drake Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This small-production Chardonnay (only 272 cases) is exceptionally rich and ripe, as Williams Selyem Chardonnays consistently are. Intense flavors of tropical fruit and pear pie (with a smoky, buttery crust) make for a powerful palate. The acidity is mouthwatering. This is the ideal wine for cracked crab and a sourdough baguette with butter."
US,86,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Lieff 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A good Cabernet, but outclassed in a flight by its more concentrated and attractive competitors. Taste too fruity, in a jammy sense, and over-oaked, showing lots of upfront vanilla extract and buttered toast. Could well develop bottle character after 2012, but it's a dice throw."
France,90,65,Pinot Noir,red,Joseph Drouhin 2012  Pommard,"With the next two vintages both damaged by hail, 2012 is the most recent normal crop from Pommard. This structured and solid wine seems to have an excess of wood at this stage, although the ripe red berry fruits do give a more generous character. The tannins, typical of Pommard, kick in—although not enough to spoil the fruitiness. Drink from 2016."
US,88,22,Chardonnay,white,Chacewater 2015 Chardonnay (Lake County),"A peanut- and butter candy-like aroma leads to a buttery, salty flavor and a texture rich enough to leave an almost-sweet glaze on the palate. The is an extreme style of Chardonnay that emphasizes concentration and richness in an unusual but delicious way."
US,87,24,Zinfandel,red,Rangeland 2007 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Here's a soft, high alcohol, slightly hot Zin, lacking in acidity. What it lacks in structure, it more than makes up for in sheer, exuberant taste. Floods the mouth with raspberries, cherries, dried fruits, dates, bacon, prosciutto, vanilla, smoky sandalwood and all sorts of other umami flavors."
Italy,85,19,Pinot Grigio,white,Girlan 2014 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),This opens with hushed aromas of white orchard fruit and spring wildflower. The racy palate shows unripe green pear and a hint of lime alongside vibrant acidity that leaves a tangy finish.
US,86,36,Pinot Noir,red,Scheid Vineyards 2015 Pinot Noir (Monterey),"Warm red-cherry aromas meet with light hints of sage and leather on the very shy nose of this bottling from one of the region's larger growers. The flavors are also light and rustic, with tart cranberry and hints of leather and game."
France,86,15,White Blend,white,Domaine des Terrisses 2015 Grande Tradition White (Gaillac),"A smooth, deliciously drinkable blend of Mauzac and Loin de l'Oeil gives crisp acidity, green fruits and tangy acidity. It's a wine that's fresh and ripe at the same time, a very dry wine that will certainly be best with food. Drink from late 2016."
France,84,10,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Les Vignerons de la Méditerranée 2009 Réserve St. Martin Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de Pays d'Oc),"Here's a simple but enjoyable Cab with notes of black plum, violet and cassis. Medium weight with soft tannins and a solid finish."
US,88,42,Chardonnay,white,Rideau 2015 Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"This longtime winery recently rebranded all of its packaging into a more art-driven style, and it is buckling down on winemaking as well. This bottling from Sierra Madre Vineyard shows light aromas of white peach, grapefruit and the slightest hint of butterscotch. The chalky flavors are easy to like if not overly complex, with light lemon and nectarine touches."
Italy,85,40,Sangiovese,red,Bonacchi 2010 Casalino  (Brunello di Montalcino),"This opens with funky aromas of barnyard, scorched earth and a whiff of decaying flower. The short, bitter palate is already evolved, offering raisin, game and a hint of cured meat alongside worn, fleeting tannins."
US,93,50,Chardonnay,white,Thomas Fogarty 2009 Portola Springs Vineyard Estate Grown Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"The closest thing in California you can get to a great French Chablis, this is absolutely dry, high in acidity and streamlined. It offers tantalizing citrus rind and peach fruit flavors, with a savory taste of cold minerals. Fans of rich, buttery Chardonnay will find it lean, but if you have a cellar, age it for six years and see how it evolves."
US,91,60,Syrah,red,Gorman 2014 The Sleeping Giant Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"This is an aromatic wine, with notes of blackberry, braised meat, Kalamata olive, iron and French-oak spices. The palate holds nothing back, with bold, rich fruit flavors that coat the palate, showing warmth on the finish. Although the oak seems prominent it still provides enjoyment."
France,87,12,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château la Valade 2014  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"This is an attractive, soft and fruity wine. With gentle tannins and a touch of spice to balance the red fruits, it is developing into a juicy wine. Lightly smoky at the end, it will be ready to drink from 2017."
France,90,34,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Dominique Gruhier 2013 Cuvée Juliette  (Bourgogne Epineuil),"Smooth and perfumed, this has a delicious, ripe black-fruit character. It is full of wood, spice and smoky tannins that demand aging. The wine is dense and layered with acidity as well as beautiful fruitiness. Drink from 2018."
France,88,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Lieujean 2014  Haut-Médoc,"One of the properties owned by Jean-Michel Lapalu, the wine comes from the far north of the Haut-Médoc appellation. It is tight with firm tannins and a dry core that will need time to soften. The fruit is going to become more generous as the wine fills out. Drink from 2020."
France,93,78,Syrah,red,Jean-Luc Colombo 2005 Terres Brulées  (Cornas),"Cornas is Colombo's home turf, and the 2005 Terres Brulees shows his mastery, offering up beefy, cedary notes but also cracked pepper and cassis alongside iron-like mineral notes. This is full-bodied and intense, with plenty of structure; drink 2015-2025."
US,91,49,Chardonnay,white,Trisaetum 2014 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This young wine is packed with a mix of fruit flavors, including apple, pear, touches of citrus and other light tropical tastes. Compact and bound up tightly, it should be cellared for another year or so, and/or aggressively decanted. The lightly buttery finish is proportionate and lingers, suggesting that further development in bottle may bring substantial rewards."
Italy,91,50,Red Blend,red,Castello Vicchiomaggio 2012 La Prima Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),"Subdued aromas of menthol, cassis, clove and sunbaked earth slowly unfold in the glass. The round, juicy palate offers mature black cherry, spiced blackberry, mocha and grilled herb alongside dusty tannins. Drink 2018–2024."
US,90,65,Zinfandel,red,Lorenzi Estate 2012 Old Vine Lopez Ranch Zinfandel (Temecula Valley),"Loads of clove, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg spice show up the strawberry, blueberry and red cherry aromas of this lavish bottling, which also offers scents of crushed rock and turned earth. Similar elements entertain the palate, culminating with a minty pine needle note, proving to be a very dynamic sip."
US,91,26,White Blend,white,Château Potelle 2010 VGS Explorer Epice White (Napa Valley),"A lovely wine, rich and balanced and crisp, that shows how sometimes an offbeat blend can be better than a varietal wine. Made from Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer and Viognier, it's deliciously off-dry. Each variety brings something to the table, resulting in a whole that's superior to its parts."
US,87,20,Riesling,white,Thomas O'Neil Cellars 2010 Fahrenheit 100 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is Riesling done in a forward and fruity style, showing a mix of peach, apple and pear flavors. Broad and accessible, it finishes with a sweet dusting of powdered sugar."
France,88,18,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Puygueraud 2015  Francs Côtes de Bordeaux,"This 60-40 blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sauvignon Gris is a tightly textured wine with hints of minerality as well as citrus and grapefruit. The wine is crisp, bright in the mouth and packed with attractive final acidity. This estate is the home of Bordeaux producer Nicolas Thienpont."
US,93,50,Chardonnay,white,Côte Bonneville 2012 DuBrul Vineyard Chardonnay (Yakima Valley),"Barrel fermented and aged on lees for 17 months, this straw-colored wine offers nuanced aromas of spice, pear, pineapple and peach. It's full bodied in feel but far from over the top with well-balanced fruit and barrel flavors and a lingering finish."
US,91,28,Syrah,red,Longboard 2009 Syrah (Russian River Valley),"This is a lovely Syrah. It has a medium-bodied lightness that feels velvety in the mouth, and is packed with sweet blackberry, plum, mocha and bacon flavors, accented with smoky sandalwood. Nice to drink now, and will gain traction over the next 6–8 years."
France,87,15,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Penin 2007  Bordeaux Blanc,"A delicious, creamy, fresh and light apéritif style of wine, white fruits just touched with spice and a soft, open, approachable texture. From an estate in the Entre-deux-Mers, this is great value Bordeaux."
US,91,25,Chardonnay,white,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2012 Cold Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine displays all of the intensity of expression of Cold Creek. Aromas of toasty spices and pear are light but lead to a full, rich-feeling palate, with the acids providing a perfect counterbalance."
US,89,30,Pinot Noir,red,Tolosa 1998 Edna Ranch Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"This Central Coast offering is sly and crafty, with a pretty cola and herb nose, a fine not-too-extracted color, and a supple mouthfeel. It has California richness, as it should, but also a reserved way about it. Sizable amounts of cinnamon, vanilla and oak are found on the persistent fadeaway. Smooth enough to be drunk now."
Italy,87,17,Pinot Grigio,white,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2010 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),This pretty Pinot Grigio would pair with or cream of shrimp risotto. There's a dry mineral note of brimstone and granite beyond more obvious tones of peach and citrus.
US,90,20,Red Blend,red,Michael David 2015 Freakshow Red (Lodi),"Big in flavor and structure, this dark-colored, full-bodied wine is concentrated and laced with fine-grained tannins to support rich blackberry flavors. It's smooth and mouthfilling, with a lingering finish."
US,88,34,Pinot Noir,red,Sonoma-Cutrer 2011 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a fancy Pinot Noir for drinking now with upscale fare such as lamb or steak. Vibrant in acidity, its light to medium body frames delicate, complex flavors of cherries, heirloom red tomatoes, persimmons and savory spices."
US,90,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Courtney Benham 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"A strong Cabernet, even an aggressive one, with very ripe, punchy blackberry and dried currant flavors that are deep and long lasting. The tannins are powerful, too. End result is a tough young wine that wants some time in the cellar. Stash until 2015."
France,88,13,Chardonnay,white,Joseph Drouhin 2010 La Forêt  (Bourgogne),"Initially this is round, ripe and floral, with a touch of honey, but then the acidity comes through with a touch of minerality. Screwcap."
US,92,24,Pinot Noir,red,Alta Maria 2013 Carbonic Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A fascinating wine, it was processed in a carbonic fashion, in which the juice is allowed to ferment inside the mostly intact grape skins, much like what's done in Beaujolais. The result is a transparent, ruby red wine that offers scents of a dust storm mixed with crushed rock and chile pepper herbaciousness. It's warm and soft on the mouth with a presence that suggests something between peppercorns and bell peppers."
US,85,40,White Blend,white,Macari 2010 Block E White (North Fork of Long Island),"Streaks of sweet cream and caramel accent delicate peach and apricot tones in this Chardonnay-dominant ice-style wine. Plush and yielding, it may come off a bit confected, but it's appealing nonetheless."
US,87,20,Chardonnay,white,Boedecker Cellars 2008 Purity Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This unusual Chardonnay is fermented and aged sur lie in 60 gallon stainless-steel barrels. The pleasant mix of fruit includes cucumber, melon, jicama and apple, balanced and tart. The color, already a fairly deep gold, suggests that you drink it soon."
US,89,24,Merlot,red,Basalt 2007 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Here is tasty, forward, juicy fruit—a fresh berry mix of strawberry, blueberry and raspberry. There is firm acidity to balance the tannins, which bring just a hint of herb. Well done; it lacks only some depth in the finish to bring the score up."
US,91,55,Pinot Noir,red,Gary Farrell 2012 Stiling Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Aromas of baked sour cherry tart precede pleasing wafts of violet and lavender. From a vineyard planted largely to a field selection of the Swan clone, it offers an expected earthiness and spiciness that intrigues around a core of balanced tension between fruit, acid and oak."
US,88,50,Pinot Noir,red,WesMar 2014 Hellenthal Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine is tannic and slightly carbonic on the palate, offering a fresh, spritzy taste. Stemmy, it shows a distinct presence of forest floor, black tea and cranberry flavor."
US,88,25,Pinot Noir,red,Savage Grace 2012 Underwood Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"Aged nine months in 20% new French oak, this enjoyable offering brings notes of cedar, cranberry and cola. True to the vintage, the flavors are richer in style while still retaining acidity with firm, tightly coiled tannins and a mesquite filled finish. Drinking young right now, hide this one away in the cellar for a while."
France,93,53,Riesling,white,Domaine Schoffit 2013 Clos Saint-Théobald Grand Cru Rangen Riesling (Alsace),"This wine clearly needs to breathe. It is only after a few minutes of airtime that it shows its true colors: then very tart and aromatic apples appear, alongside a hint of smoke and a sheer touch of lemon freshness. The palate continues on that lemony streak and is absolutely dry. The body is lithe and slender and shows great freshness and intensity. Apple and stone flavors linger. Drink 2020–2030."
US,85,11,Red Blend,red,David Hill NV Farmhouse Red (America),"A half dozen unrelated red grapes are tossed into the mix here, making a serviceable blend with no distinctive flavor or focus. It's a stewpot red, fine for everyday enjoyment."
US,92,70,Pinot Noir,red,Bergström 2015 Silice Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Formerly the deLancellotti vineyard, Silice brings fresh, supple flavors of bright raspberry and cherry fruit. A distinctive ashy stone note forms the bassline, holding the finish firm. It should benefit from another year of bottle age. Or give it a long decant to enjoy now."
US,87,12,Red Blend,red,One 2015 Flock Red (California),A rich mouthfeel and considerable sweetness come with oaky spicy aromas and jammy fruit flavors in this full-bodied and rather tannic wine that was blended from mostly Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon.
US,88,27,Riesling,white,Smith-Madrone 2012 Riesling (Spring Mountain District),"There should more interest from consumers for well-put-together Rieslings like this. It's dryish, low in alcohol, acidic and minerally, with effusive citrus, peach, white-flower and honey flavors that require some thought to fully appreciate. With only 12.5% alcohol by volume, it has a complex delicacy."
US,90,22,Riesling,white,Paumanok 2015 Dry Riesling (North Fork of Long Island),"Light-bodied and lean yet ebulliently perfumed, this dry Riesling offers layers of floral, fruity refreshment. It's delightfully peachy on the palate, but zesty pink grapefruit and fresh herb notes lend structure and dimension. The finish lingers long, augmented by a bristle of green-tea tannins."
US,89,55,Red Blend,red,David Arthur 2009 Meritaggio Red (Napa Valley),"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it's a little high in alcohol and astringently tannic, but it has deep flavors of red- and black-fruit liqueurs and new oak. It's a heady wine that would pair well with robust fare."
US,93,28,Pinot Noir,red,Proteus 2015 Manisa Jo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Like the winery's other Pinot Noir, this seems way underpriced for the quality. Its subtle layers of cherry and plum are enhanced with baking spice, toasted coconut and caramel highlights. It can easily stand beside wines costing twice as much. Drink now through 2028."
France,90,20,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Fabrice Larochette 2015 La Grande Bruyère  (Mâcon-Fuissé),The wine is from a tiny parcel (around an acre) of vines that are over 30-years-old. It is concentrated both with fine fruit and sweet acidity. Yellow fruits are cut with lime and green plums. A touch of vanilla gives the wine a full final aftertaste. Drink from 2017.
US,88,20,Red Blend,red,Stemilt Creek 2004 Stemilt Hill Red Wine Red (Washington),"This is very well made, smooth and supple. The round, approachable fruit tastes of red currant, red berry, and black olive. There is a flash of heat in the back of the throat, but it offer excellent value. Unfortunately it's very limited—just 99 cases."
US,88,22,White Blend,white,Balboa 2007 Mith White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A rare gem, this Sémillon-Sauvignon Blanc blend is sourced entirely from Red Mountain's Klipsun vineyard. Aged for 10 months in one-year-old French oak, it's a spicy wine with aromatics and flavors of botanicals such as mint and quinine. Fruit is sharp with flavors of grapefruit and white peach, and hints of toast and cracker."
US,86,20,Chardonnay,white,Del Rio 2015 Chardonnay (Rogue Valley),"This young wine could use additional bottle age. The edges are sharp and there is some bite to the fruit. Citrus pith and rind flavors dominate, rather than flesh. It's spare and lightly bitter in the finish."
US,87,17,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Kunde 2012 Magnolia Lane Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley),"This wine is very rich and ripe with tangerine, Meyer-lemon and peach flavors, but with a stimulating cut of green grass. Crisp acidity and super-clean winemaking gives it a finish that's pure and intense. Another fine bottling from this veteran winery."
Italy,92,40,Sangiovese,red,Capannelle 2007 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"A beautiful expression of Sangiovese, this shows delicate and elegant characteristics of wild berry and light spice. The finish is silky and crisp, and the wine would stand up nicely to breaded veal or roast chicken."
US,87,12,Red Blend,red,Gnarly Head 2011 Authentic Red (Lodi),"This is a rich, soft, decadent red, with flavors of dark chocolate, juicy red fruit and a hint of leather. Made from Zinfandel, Syrah, Merlot, Malbec, Petite Sirah and a few other red varieties, this is a wine that will delight many. Stock up."
US,88,30,Syrah,red,Des Voigne Cellars 2006 Montreux Syrah (Red Mountain),"This is a substantial, dense Syrah, which runs quickly from berries and cherries right into barrel flavors of chocolate and butterscotch. It's balanced and delicious, but does not have the complexity and more interesting earth/herb notes that the grape is capable of."
US,89,42,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Foxen 7200 2012 Range 30 West Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"Winemaker Billy Wathen blends 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Franc into this blend that's named after the U.S. Geologic Survey's name for Happy Canyon. A nose of dried oregano and thyme has a Bing cherry backdrop, with a palate of green peppers, blackberries and tomato leaf."
US,89,28,Chardonnay,white,Occasio 2010 Del Arroyo Vineyard Chardonnay (Livermore Valley),"Occasio, which has made a nice Fume Blanc for a couple of vintages now, is giving the world this, its first Chardonnay, a true to its French-oak-fermented style that's quite citrus-laden, tart, lean and mean and yet voluptuous, with its barrel age showing, and toasty on the finish."
Italy,86,15,White Blend,white,Masi 2002 Classico  (Soave),"An easy, full-flavored wine, with crisp, clean fruit, flavors of almonds and a touch of soft,ripeness."
France,87,23,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine Fouassier 2010 Sur le Fort  (Sancerre),"This is a herbaceous wine with dominant green fruit, followed by acidity and fine flavors of sweet currant, kiwi and thyme. It is fresh and ready to drink."
US,90,45,Chardonnay,white,Peter Paul Wines 2014 Bacigalupi Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Creamy butter and vanilla aromas suggest richness in this vineyard-designated wine, and its body and texture are equally full. Spicy oak and nutmeg flavors accent its dense, ripe apple and pear flavors, adorned in caramelized honey."
France,90,26,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Liversan 2012  Haut-Médoc,"Liversan makes a serious style of wine from its 125-acre vineyard, situated in the north of the Haut-Médoc. Dense, this is balanced between the black plum fruits and dry tannins. It's a wine for long-term aging, so drink from 2018."
US,93,75,Merlot,red,Quilceda Creek 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Rich and chocolaty, this dense and detailed wine is loaded with brambly fruit, ripe cherry and baking chocolate. It's dotted with fine-grained, coffee-streaked tannins, and finishes with highlights of butterscotch and malted milk candies. As with all the 2005 Quilceda's, this is still young and tight. It is dominated by the barrel flavors that only slowly meld into the massive fruit with extensive breathing time (36 hours after being opened the wine was still improving)."
US,84,17,Chardonnay,white,Chloe 2014 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"Aged in both French and American oak, this is a tropical and oaky expression of the grape, round and slightly sweetened atop a silkiness of smooth butter."
US,92,28,Syrah,red,Upland Estates 2008 Syrah (Snipes Mountain),"It's a shame that so little of this wine is made, as it is a textbook example of a powerful, beautifully balanced Syrah from this tiny AVA in the heart of the Yakima Valley. Black fruits abound, wrapped in a firm, muscular, polished package by fine-grained tannins and a dark chocolate finish."
Italy,86,13,Red Blend,red,Natale Verga 2010 Antale Red (Sicilia),"A 70-30 blend of Nero d'Avola and Syrah, this has a dark garnet color, with ripe aromas of blackberry and sour cherry. The wine's acidity gives the palate a lively pop."
US,88,30,Pinot Noir,red,Erath 2005 Estate Selection Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This is a blend of five different Dundee Hills sites, and as is often the case in Oregon, delivers more accessible and complete flavors than some of the winery's individual vineyard-designated wines. It's herbal and spicy, with strong scents of tomato leaf and root beer. The fruit is tart and clean, and the wine comes out swinging, but then it falls away in the back end, adding just a lick of vanilla as a sweet coda."
Italy,87,21,Red Blend,red,Dei 2014  Rosso di Montepulciano,"Simple and easy drinking, this opens with aromas of red berry and purple flower. The light-bodied palate offers strawberry, cherry and a hint of baking spice alongside zesty acidity. Enjoy soon."
France,86,18,Pinot Gris,white,Jean-Baptiste Adam 2012 Tradition Pinot Gris (Alsace),"This is a softly spicy wine that is understated and light. With its brisk acidity and flavors of citrus and lychee, it is an easy, gentle wine that is ready to drink now."
US,93,65,Chardonnay,white,Lange 2014 Freedom Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This top-tier vineyard delivers gorgeous flavors. Big, juicy, rich and round, it piles on the fruit flavors—apples, pears, white peaches and lemons. All are balanced against each other and the supporting, natural acidity, finished with a frame of new-oak toast. Drink 2016 to 2028."
US,93,55,Zinfandel,red,Deerfield Ranch 2005 Buchignani Garcia Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Not many people cellar Zinfandel but this is one you might want to for a few years. It's very dry and tannic and extraordinarily dense, with a complex spectrum of red and black currant, pomegranate, molasses cookie, baked cherry pie, root beer, cocoa and peppery spice flavors that go on and on. Shows Zin's full-bodied power, with a fruity sweetness that seduces the palate. Absolutely delicious, but if you're allergic to high alcohol, go elsewhere."
US,84,22,Pinot Gris,white,Rexford 2010 Regan Vineyard Pinot Gris (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This seems heavy and sweet for a Pinot Gris, with flavors of white sugar, orange and vanilla."
US,85,18,Chardonnay,white,Gruet NV Blanc de Blancs Sauvage Chardonnay (America),"Citron, lemon rind and pastry crust aromas travel to a vigorous palate of foaming bubbles and racing acidity. A sweet plastic note meets a squeeze of lemon on the finish."
Italy,86,16,Red Blend,red,Casale dello Sparviero 2013  Chianti Classico,"This offers aromas of just-crushed grapes, a note of chopped thyme and a whiff of moist soil. The palate is simple and soft, offering wild strawberry and a hint of fennel seed alongside round tannins."
US,88,24,Riesling,white,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2013 Homestead Reserve Riesling (Finger Lakes),"A delicate cherry blossom perfume persists throughout Hazlitt's Rieslings this vintage, and it's especially noticeable in the Homestead Reserve. While off dry in style, it's intensely mineral with a lemon-lime zing that reverberates on the finish."
US,91,39,Chardonnay,white,Cebada 2012 Estate Chardonnay (Santa Ynez Valley),"Charred oak characterizes the nose of this wine from an estate just 12 miles from the Pacific Ocean, but chopped dill takes the place of overpowering butter aromas. The herbs show up on the palate, hovering on pine needles, sandalwood and oak toothpicks, with lime pith keeping it fresh."
France,92,40,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Château Salettes 2011 Red (Bandol),"Structured and firm, this is a tight wine with powerful, youthful acidity as well as a dense structure and dark tannins. It has weight as well, indicating a wine with excellent aging potential. Drink from 2016."
US,89,40,Red Blend,red,Ambassador Vineyard 2013 Estate Grown Diplomat Red (Red Mountain),"This wine is an intriguing blend of three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon, with the rest Syrah (20%) and Grenache. Aromas of café au lait, exotic spice, vanilla, wood notes and black cherries lead to tangy cherry flavors backed by lightly grainy tannins."
France,95,200,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Bertagna 2015  Clos Saint-Denis,"Aged for a year in new wood barrels, this powerful, concentrated wine shows both richness and considerable aging potential. It is a powerhouse of ripe damson fruits and impressive tannins. Structured and intense, it needs to age for many years. Don't drink before 2026."
US,88,55,Pinot Noir,red,Bernardus 2014 Sierra Mar Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Faint cranberry and incense aromas show on the nose of this bottling. The palate offers more flavors, including coffee, black tar, pomegranate and peppercorns."
US,87,95,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Feliz Noche 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County),"With ripe blackberry, currant and cassis flavors accented with smoky oak, this Cab is a bit soft and direct in the mouth. It's a rich wine, but not particularly complex. Drink now."
US,87,30,Syrah,red,Blue Rock 2006 Syrah (Alexander Valley),"This very dry Syrah has soft tannins and a full-bodied mouthfeel, with complicated flavors of baked cherries, cola, bacon and sandalwood. It's quite a good wine, but astringent now, making for a puckery feeling. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink with rich fare."
Italy,86,10,Merlot,red,Cusumano 2007 Merlot (Sicilia),"This is a succulent and juicy red wine with pretty cherry nuances, mature prune and spice. The wine tastes slightly sweet and offers clean flavors of blueberry and bright red fruit on the close."
France,92,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château de Corbiac 2005  Pécharmant,"Maturing well, this wine shows 2005's combination of richness and structure. It is built around firm, dusty tannins and big black-currant flavors, with a fine perfumed character from the wood aging. Ready to drink in a year, but it should age for several more."
France,87,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Moya 2012  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"This ripe, deliciously fruity wine has red plum and black currant fruits along with fragrant acidity and a gently tannic structure. It will be ready to drink from 2017. Canadian David Curl purchased Moya in 2008; Damien Landouar is the winery director. The vineyard was certified organic in 2013."
France,87,10,Chardonnay,white,Maison de la Villette 2016 Chardonnay (Vin de France),"This is a warm, fruity wine with a flavor profile that fluctuates between citrus and pear qualities. It has vanilla, almond and attractive spice accents, finishing balanced and ready to drink."
US,83,11,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,McManis 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Soft, simple and a little overripe, with baked cherry and black currant flavors. Finishes dry and tannic."
France,96,100,Riesling,white,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2014 Brand Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Smoke and the merest, tantalizing whiff of toffee apple can be discerned on the nose. Fragrant herbs—think chervil and yarrow—also make an appearance. The palate is dry but brims with ripe lemon oil and fresh lemon fruit. This is streamlined and impactful, with a commanding, overarching freshness that only enforces the inherent power of this site more. For now this is tightly wound and still closed, majoring on its ample lemon charm but this needs bottle age to let the myriad notes promised on the nose unfold on the palate. Drink 2022–2040."
US,92,45,Pinot Noir,red,Andrew Rich 2013 The Knife Edge Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This fairly limited release remains sturdy and tight, with flavors stacked impressively. Deep cherry kirsch fruit is at the core, with streaks of cola and sassafras. As the wine breathes, it gains both flesh and momentum, moving into a long and delicious finish."
France,89,26,Chardonnay,white,William Fèvre 2005 Domaine  (Chablis),"For simple Chablis, this is impressive, rich, fruity, with wood as well as lively, fresh acidity. Nosings find toast and butter, with a hint of light honey."
US,83,9,Pinot Grigio,white,Oak Grove 2016 Family Reserve Pinot Grigio (California),"Light green-apple aromas and crisp, almost neutral flavors leave this wine with a bland personality. It is dry and clean on the palate."
US,90,48,Pinot Noir,red,Native Flora 2014 Next Time Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Light pretty red fruits mingle here, supported with tart citrus. It's an elegant, rather steely style, and one that needs aeration and a bit of patience. The best drinking window should be 2020 through 2025."
US,87,55,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Jean Edwards 2008 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Lots of delicious, complex blackberry, crème de cassis, mineral and cedar flavors in this dry, tannic wine. One quibble is the acidity, which is overly sharp and feels odd, given how ripe the wine is."
Italy,86,15,Red Blend,red,Leopoldo I di Toscana 2012 D'Echo Red (Toscana),"A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Merlot, this easygoing red offers aromas and flavors of red currant, black cherry, white pepper and a hint of clove. Smooth, rather fleeting tannins provide the easy-drinking framework."
France,90,65,Pinot Noir,red,Joseph Drouhin 2012  Pommard,"With the next two vintages both damaged by hail, 2012 is the most recent normal crop from Pommard. This structured and solid wine seems to have an excess of wood at this stage, although the ripe red berry fruits do give a more generous character. The tannins, typical of Pommard, kick in—although not enough to spoil the fruitiness. Drink from 2016."
US,89,14,Red Blend,red,Victor Vineyards 2013 Roadside Red (Lodi),"Bold and full bodied, packed with ripe blackberry, dark chocolate and spice flavors, this wine is also mouth-coating due to fine, soft tannins and a hint of sweetness. It will be fun for people who enjoy drama in their wine, but needs to be tamed by a juicy steak or the equivalent."
France,92,28,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Hubert Brochard 2012 Aujourd'hui comme Autrefois  (Sancerre),"“Today, as in the past,” reads the title of this wine. Rich and full, it was aged on the lees to give extra weight and body. The result is ripe with yellow fruits as well as citrus, with full-bodied flavor. It could well age until 2015."
US,92,32,Chardonnay,white,Pessagno 2010 Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Rich doesn't begin to describe the layers of flavor and texture. This wine is massive, with notes of tropical fruit and apricot, with a slightly botrytized character that Sleepy Hollow Chardonnays often display. The oak is lavish and buttery, but perfectly matched to the wine's volume. It also has classic Monterey acidity—as pert as a squeeze of lime. Delicious, full bodied and exotic, it defines its vineyard and appellation."
US,93,36,Chardonnay,white,Pellet Estate 2014 Un-Oaked Sunchase Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"From a beautiful site overlooking the Petaluma Gap, this wine opens in pretty honeysuckle aromas before unfurling clean, focused flavors of green-apple slices, lemon meringue and a touch of anise. Bright acidity is left to shine without the intrusion of oak, and yet the texture doesn't suffer, offering plenty of velvety smoothness."
US,89,16,Chardonnay,white,Lange 2012 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This value-priced Chardonnay is fresh, crisply acidic, and immaculate. The green apple and jicama flavors are dappled with a hint of white pepper. 60% was fermented in neutral oak."
US,93,35,Syrah,red,City Winery Chicago 2012 Thompson Vineyard Reserve Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"It's amazing how wineries across the country can take Central Coast fruit and make it sing, but this producer certainly does. Lavish vanilla, cola and ripe black cherries invite the nose with glee. Then the palate blends black cherry and black plum with caramel and mocha notes in this crowd-pleaser."
France,87,29,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Méric 2014  Médoc,"This wine with its tight black-currant character, is still also firm with tannins. It has a juicy edge that will develop well as the wine matures. With crisp acidity and structure, it should age. Drink from 2018."
Italy,90,44,Red Blend,red,Farnese 2009 Edizione Cinque Autoctoni Red (Italy),"A symbolic expression of Italian winemaking, this blend of five grapes (Montepulciano, Primitivo, Sangiovese, Negroamaro and Malvasia) crosses regional borders and delivers various local wine traditions in a single bottle. The wine is bold, rich and very masculine with huge vanilla oak spice, black cherry and chocolate."
US,85,18,Chardonnay,white,Calera 2010 Thirty-Fifth Anniversary Chardonnay (Central Coast),"Almost as sweet as a dessert wine, with buttered toast, honey, caramel corn and pineapple jam fruit flavors. There's good acidity, but the sweetness makes it simple."
US,87,21,Red Blend,red,Tower 15 2011 The Jetty Red (Paso Robles),"Ripe flavors of blackberries, currants and leather mark this blend of Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah. It's tannic and very dry, with alcohol providing fat, glyceriney richness."
US,88,60,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Matthews 2013 Reserve Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"In this blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc, vanilla, carob, herb, green wood and dark fruit aromas are followed by fruit and oak-derived flavors in equal proportion. It shows restraint but doesn't come together."
US,91,24,Red Blend,red,Naggiar 2013 Mistero Red (Sierra Foothills),"A fabulous blend of Zinfandel, Sangiovese and Syrah, this wine has earthy, dried herb aromas, dense fruit and dark chocolate flavors and considerable soothing tannins. It is dry in style, not too full-bodied, and has a lingering finish. Needs time to mature, and will best after 2018."
US,90,48,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Keating 2009 Montecillo Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Generous in blackberries, blueberries and cedar, with a pleasantly meaty, smoky edge. Quite fine in its own way, but a bit angular at this time. Blame it on immaturity, and give this young Cabernet at least five years to mellow out."
Italy,87,20,Red Blend,red,Palazzo Vecchio 2013 Dogana  (Rosso di Montepulciano),"Rose, violet, black raspberry, wild cherry and espresso aromas lead the nose. The juicy fruit palate is accented with notes of sweet cake spices and supported by lithe tannins. Enjoy soon."
France,89,21,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Les Vignerons de la Méditerranée 2005 Cuvée Mythique Réserve Red (Corbières),"With 250 cases imported, this Reserve is easier to acquire, half the price and almost as satisfying as the brand's Limited Release offering. Loaded with influence of the surrounding garrigue, including bay leaves and sage, aromas and flavors of black cherries, plum skin, violets and tar also abound. Velvety in texture and full in the mouth with a long, evolving finish that ends on a divine mocha note."
US,89,30,Chardonnay,white,JCB 2010 No. 81 Sonoma Collection Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Lots of zesty, mouthwatering acidity in this Chardonnay. The pineapple, crème brûlée, buttered toast and vanilla flavors are so rich that they require balance, which the zippy acidity provides. Maybe a touch too oaky, but that's a matter of personal preference."
US,83,9,Merlot,red,Alias 2011 Merlot (California),"Tastes overripe, showing raisin and prune flavors and lots of oak, with awkward tannins. On the plus side, it's dry, and the alcohol is a refreshing 13.6% by volume, giving it an elegant mouthfeel."
US,91,36,Syrah,red,Jason-Stephens 2011 Estate Select Syrah (Santa Clara Valley),"Fresh boysenberries and a blueberry sorbet character mix with notes of minty tarragon, dill and hot gravel on the nose of this wine, from an area between Gilroy and Morgan Hill. Peppercorns are prominent on the relatively light palate, along with tobacco, espresso and boysenberry."
US,82,18,Chardonnay,white,North Gate 2012 Chardonnay (Virginia),"Muddled white-orchard fruit aromas carry onto the soft palate, which carries a trace of sweetness."
US,85,30,Syrah,red,Gamache 2013 Estate Grown Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Barrel aromas are in the lead here, with notes of sawdust and cedar, along with Band Aid and gamy notes. Dark fruit aromas are in the background. The full-bodied flavors reveal more of the same, showing a lot of heat."
US,90,18,Pinot Gris,white,Vista Hills 2008 Flagler Estate Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills),"Another fine estate-grown Pinot Gris from Vista Hills, with plenty of green apple and Bosch pear fruit, along with some light cinnamon spice. There is also a suggestion of flower in both the nose and the mouth, but overall it's a bigger wine than that, with the fruit front and center."
US,89,34,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,J. Rickards 2008 Five Sisters Blend Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"This is a softly sophisticated Cabernet that will please fans of the variety who want a wine that's a little earthier than your riper Napa Valley versions. It has herb and tobacco flavors, but there's also a delicious sunburst of sweetly ripe cherries right in the middle that lasts through the finish. Should develop over the next 7–8 years."
US,86,24,Merlot,red,Niner 2007 Bootjack Ranch Merlot (Paso Robles),"Good, deeply extracted flavors in this darkly soft wine, with blackberries, plums and spicy, chocolaty chai tea. It's nicely dry. The tannins are a little off, with some ragged, green edges that won't age away, so drink now."
US,89,14,Red Blend,red,Three Rivers 2011 River's Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A very fine edition of River's Red, this returns Merlot to the first chair (55%) position, with Syrah and Cab Franc splitting the rest. Sturdy, chewy, bone dry, tannic and authoritative, it's a quintessential steak wine. Cassis, earth, hints of dried mushroom and those stiff but powerful tannins combine to make this a standout at the price."
US,93,55,Pinot Noir,red,Siduri 2015 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Deep and hearty aromas of blackberry, candied violet and dried lavender are enhanced by a touch of roasted pork on the nose of this red by Adam Lee. The full-bodied palate is framed by soft yet structural tannins and a slow-rising acidity, showing dark berries, charred beef and a hint of licorice."
France,83,13,Merlot,red,Château Lamothe-Vincent 2013 Intense  (Bordeaux),"This is a light 100% Merlot wine, with tangy red berry fruits. Tight and mineral with high levels of acidity, it is not for aging, so drink now."
US,88,40,Red Blend,red,Galante 2014 Bulls Eye Red (Carmel Valley),"Black cherry, crushed concrete and spicy peppercorn show on the nose of this Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah dessert blend. There are luscious ripe flavors on the palate, including crème de cassis, black plum and prune, with a gravel-like minerality lending elegance. The high alcohol is well integrated."
France,90,24,Pinot Noir,red,Hugel 2013 Classic Pinot Noir (Alsace),"A lovely, clean and aromatic lift of ripe red cherries is instantly appetizing. The palate is full of juicy fruit but structured with slightly rustic but smoothed-out tannins and a bright lively freshness. This is honest fresh-faced fruit-driven Pinot Noir without any pretentiousness that is a joy to drink."
Italy,90,65,Chardonnay,white,Elena Walch 2014 Beyond the Clouds Chardonnay (Alto Adige),"Made predominantly with Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of lemon zest, acacia honey and a toasted note. The lively elegant palate offers yellow apple, apricot, vanilla and a touch of baking spice. It's well balanced, with bright acidity."
US,91,35,Syrah,red,City Winery Chicago 2011 Alder Springs Vineyard Reserve Syrah (Mendocino),"This concentrated wine is also well balanced. Deep red color comes with bright aromas that combine red and black cherries with cranberries. Flavors repeat the cherry-berry mix and ride on a surprisingly light, agile texture. Tasty now, it should gain complexity through 2020."
US,85,38,Zinfandel,red,Buena Vista 2013 Arpad's Selection Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Raisin-baked plum defines this hearty, full-bodied and ultraripe wine, rich in red berry and robust on the finish."
France,90,62,Pinot Noir,red,Alex Gambal 2013  Volnay,"This wine is round, opulent and beautifully perfumed., with a structure smoothed by the ripe fruits and generous texture. Acidity and a fresh aftertaste bring out cherry flavors and leave a bright aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
US,92,28,Zinfandel,red,Kokomo 2014 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This impresses in graceful red berry, dried herb and wild vanilla, each component complementing the next. Well integrated and well made, this is a lengthy, complex and delicious wine that'll please a range of palates in search of moderate ripeness."
US,93,60,Pinot Noir,red,Drouhin Oregon Roserock 2015 Zéphirine Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Still quite young and showing some grapey fruit flavors, this second vintage release is bursting with purple fruit and chocolate malt flavors. Streaks of cola and a mineral-drenched finish add depth and texture."
France,85,20,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine de Reuilly 2015 Pinot Noir (Reuilly),This is a crisp cherry-flavored wine. Cool-climate Pinot Noir has a light texture that gives the wine a hint of tannins although it is much more about fruit and bright acidity. Drink now.
US,84,24,Syrah,red,Valley View 2012 Anna Maria Syrah (Applegate Valley),"A definitive scent of leather suggests brettanomyces has taken over here. That leathery nose and palate totally dims the fruit, and dries out the finish."
US,87,20,Pinot Gris,white,Coelho 2015 Renovação Estate Vineyards Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Quite tart, the fruit here touches (just barely) on melon, with orange and lemon zest, a bit of lime, and plenty of acid. All stainless fermented, it went through full malolactic."
US,82,26,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Azur 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),"Strong in gooseberry flavors that are unripe, with those notoriously green, sour feline elements. Despite some citrus and apple flavors, it's a hard wine to warm up to."
US,91,28,Chardonnay,white,Iron Horse 2006 Estate Chardonnay (Green Valley),"Iron Horse's estate Chard is a remarkably consistent wine. Never overoaked, superripe or heavy, it always has an elegant minerality. The '06, from a coolish vintage, is flavored with green apples, Meyer lemons and Bosc pears."
US,87,55,Chardonnay,white,Migration 2012 Searby Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A site planted to the Rued clone of Chardonnay in classic Russian River Valley Goldridge soils, Searby is expressive in honeysuckle and orange blossom floral tones. This balanced wine is soft and round, its time in oak reaching an apex on the finish."
US,85,25,Syrah,red,Flocchini 2011 Syrah (Sonoma Coast),"Dry and tannic, this has a sharp, green texture and flavor that hems in the blackberry and cherry notes. It's a wine to drink with a burger or a meat loaf."
France,89,12,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Domaine Charles Thomas 2009 Red (Côtes du Rhône),"A blend of 50% Grenache, 40% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre, this is full bodied and richly textured, redolent of wild thyme and lavender, black cherries and a hint of cocoa. Drink this charmer over the next couple of years."
US,94,50,Chardonnay,white,Gary Farrell 2007 Starr Ridge Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Farrell's 2007 lineup of Chardonnays is a triumph, and this Starr Ridge is among their best. It's a big wine, rich in tropical fruit, peach, green apple, mineral and oak flavors that completely satisfy now. Yet there's an acidic urgency that suggests aging for up to six years, by which time the wine should achieve a honeyed creaminess."
US,83,41,Red Blend,red,The Federalist 2012 Dueling Pistols Red (Dry Creek Valley),"This 50-50 split of Zinfandel and Syrah is skunky and heavy, a toasty concoction of boysenberry and blackberry jam that finishes abruptly with an herbal afternote."
US,92,150,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Patland 2011 Stagecoach Vineyard Select Barrel Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),"This powerful wine has benefited from time in bottle, offering an elegance of peppercorn, cedar and black licorice around a lushness of velvety black fruit. Full-figured, it also exhibits rocky minerality, a nod to its vineyard site, as well as spicy layers of clove on the finish."
France,89,43,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Beauregard 2006 Le Benjamin de Beauregard  (Pomerol),"The French often use the name Benjamin to indicate a youngest son, and this second wine from Château Beauregard exhibits all the youthful exuberance of a young wine. It doesn't have weight, but it does have balance and fresh acidity, given depth by wood."
US,90,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Amizetta 2012 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This 100% varietal wine is dark and foreboding in brambly blackberry and dense, smooth layers of textured oak and vanilla. Beyond full bodied, it holds on to enough acidity to make it complex and age-worthy, finishing in a splash of toffee and caramel."
US,89,40,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Ehret 2007 Bella's Blend Red (Knights Valley),"An interesting and flavorful blend of Bordeaux varieties and Syrah that has some real complexity. It's a dry, smoothly tannic wine, with rich berry, currant and chocolate notes. Made in the modern style of soft appeal, it's ready to drink now."
US,91,39,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Auclair 2013 Right Blend Artz Vineyard Red (Red Mountain),"A blend of Merlot (73%), Cabernet Franc (24%) and Petit Verdot, it rises from the glass with aromas of cedar, flowers and red and black fruit. The black-fruit flavors are dense but deft, with firm tannins backing them up."
France,88,20,Pinot Noir,red,Allimant-Laugner NV Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace),"The nose hovers somewhere between pink grapefruit and Cox Orange Pippin apple: that is to say the flavors are pure, fruity and crisp. The palate is dry and aromatic, fizzy and easy, foaming and light. This is an ideal party wine, enlivening everything with its weightless freshness."
US,82,20,Chardonnay,white,Jax 2007 Y3 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Too sweet and oaky for comfort, with caramelized flavors of pineapple and apple juice that finish with a white sugar aftertaste."
US,92,50,Pinot Noir,red,Gary Farrell 2010 Stiling Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A strong, punchy Pinot Noir, ungainly now for its immaturity, showing tons of jammy raspberries and cherries. The acidity is tart, which is good in a wine this rich, providing balance, and there's also a scour of tannins. All indications suggest cellaring this wine for at least six years."
US,93,30,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Eden 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Extremely refreshing and lovely on the nose, this slightly lower-priced bottling from the Mount Eden team shows nectarine, crisp pluot, cherimoya flesh and the lightest hint of Key-lime zest on the nose. The structure on the sip is intense, with stony crushed-concrete elements and flavors of lime rind, cold Gala apple and gunmetal."
France,89,37,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Gravas 2009  Sauternes,"A rich wine from a fine Sauternes year. It has honey, sweet orange marmalade and just enough freshness. At the same time, there is enough botrytis to give a good dry edge. With its weight and bit of spice, it could age."
US,91,40,Pinot Noir,red,Evening Land 2008 Occidental Coast Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This blend of different vineyards is immediately appealing for its silky mouthfeel and delicious flavors. Floods the mouth with raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, bacon, dusty herb and sandalwood flavors. So pretty, so polished, so refined. Will develop over the next two–four years."
US,88,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Thurston Wolfe 2012 The Teacher Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"Hailing from Destiny Ridge, Double Canyon and McKinley Spring vineyards, this wine is lighter in color and shows subtle suggestions of vanilla, chocolate, woodspice and red cherry. It's reserved in style with coffee flavors and soft, plump tannins."
France,88,29,Chardonnay,white,Clos des Rocs 2015 Les Barres  (Pouilly-Loché),"This warm, ripe wine is smoothly creamy and ready to drink. Touches of yellow fruits are balanced with just the right amount of acidity. The wine is rich and generous."
US,91,22,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Barber 2016 Lumiere Laughing Raven Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley),"Crisp and tart in lemon peel and grapefruit, the loveliest aspect of this lightly ripe wine is its sublime texture, an earthy velvety expression of fineness and elegance that persists in its delicacy."
US,86,35,Pinot Noir,red,Lagana 2013 Breezy Slope Vineyard Pinot Noir (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Grown in the southern section of the valley in the foothills of the Blue Mountains, this rare varietal bottling from this appellation shows aromas of cranberry, raspberry and citrus, along with some hints of oxidation. It's tart and full in feel, not seeming entirely varietally correct."
US,93,200,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Diamond Creek 2011 Red Rock Terrace Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"From a seven-acre section of the vineyard, this offers plenty of saddle leather and cedar amidst spicy cardamom layers, a soft, juicy core and tingling acidity. The structure and weight suggest the ability to cellar comfortably through 2020."
US,93,75,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Raphael 2013 Primo Reserve Estate Bottled Red (North Fork of Long Island),"Ripe, rich fruit and bold, mouth dampening tannins express the rugged muscularity of this wine. A blend of classic Bordeaux grape varieties, it highlights pristine black cherry and cassis against a backdrop of spice, cedar, barnyard and tobacco complexities. It needs a few years to ease off its brawniness, but should improve beautifully through at least 2023."
US,85,16,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Sterling 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa County),"Creamy vanilla and fig combine around a thick texture complemented by bright, consistent waves of ripe tangerine. The finish is short, filled in by more citrus."
US,92,45,Pinot Noir,red,Iris Vineyards 2015 Bayliss-Bower Vineyard Pinot Noir,"Despite the rather high listed alcohol, this looks and feels elegant, even refined. The well-balanced barrel treatment puts highlights of toast and caramel around fruit flavors that sing of spicy plum cake."
US,91,45,Chardonnay,white,Foley 2012 Bar Lazy S Ranch Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Named after a property that Bill Foley's family owns in Texas, this kicks off with citrusy crème brûlée and tight honey elements on the nose. It opens softly with French toast on the palate, then tightens up with limestone minerality and lemon rind acidity. Just enough buttery vanilla lingers into the finish."
US,84,10,Chardonnay,white,Little Black Dress 2005 Chardonnay (California),"From giant Brown-Forman, it's a lip-smackingly fruity Chard, bigtime in pineapple, vanilla and smoky caramel flavors, with a sweet, honeyed finish."
US,88,38,Pinot Noir,red,Matrix 2009 Bacigalupi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A soft, delicious Pinot, although you should give it an hour or two in a decanter to let it breathe. It's rich and sweet in raspberry, cherry, brown sugar and cinnamon flavors, showing the warmth of its vineyard origin. Drink now."
US,90,38,Pinot Noir,red,Hirsch 2014 Bohan-Dillon Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Somewhat lean in texture but very tasty and classic in terms of aroma and flavor, this wine has a unique presence. Aromas suggest rhubarb, raspberry and black tea, and the flavors reflect that complexity, too. At less than half the price of Hirsch's higher-priced wines, it has almost as much charm."
US,90,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Respite 2010 Indulgence Reichel Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"This wine was made by Bordeaux-trained winemaker Denis Malbec and his wife, sommelier May-Britt Malbec. They've sourced some exceptional fruit from the Reichel Vineyard, including some Malbec, with some Cabernet Franc also blended in. Offering big tannins that await the cellar, it is otherwise a juicy wine rich in black and blue berry fruit, as well as a taste of graham cracker and cigar. Enjoy through 2025."
Italy,90,29,Red Blend,red,Baglio del Cristo di Campobello 2012 Adènzia Red (Sicilia),"A blend of Nero d'Avola and Syrah, this conveys aromas of scorched earth, crushed flower, dark berry and a whiff of cooking spice. The palate offers ripe cherry, graphite, ground black pepper and a smoky note alongside velvety tannins."
France,88,45,Pinot Noir,red,Bouchard Père & Fils 2011  Monthélie,"This is a ripe and fruity wine, with soft tannins and rich raspberry fruits. Already accessible, it's very full in the mouth, wonderfully juicy and jammy, yet with some freshness at the end."
US,92,80,Pinot Noir,red,Testarossa 2014 Niclaire Pinot Noir (California),"Welcoming on the nose, this top-end bottling offers aromas of baked red cherry, clove and black plum before diving into crushed graphite, wet slate and loamy mud aromas. Soft on the palate but immediately vibrant with acidity, flavors of dark cranberry and tart cherry are lifted by anise-like spice."
US,92,80,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,The Grade 2007 Winfield Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Shows a great return to form over the 2006, with the lush flavors and rich attractions of the 2005. With soft but complex tannins, the wine immediately appeals for its wealth of blackberries, black currants and plums, enriched with smoky oak. Very rich, pure and refined. Fine now, with a good decant, and should age well for a decade."
US,90,70,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Apsara 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Robust, pillowy tannins provide a density and grip that lasts through the finish of this 100% varietal wine. Blackberry, black currant and vanilla are the highlights, finding balance and powerful concentration on the palate."
US,93,90,Pinot Noir,red,Donum 2012 West Slope Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Substantive in oak and weight, this concentrated, estate-grown wine is impressive in velvety texture and a savory conjuring of tobacco and black tea. Dark, brambly blackberry and dark cherry join in on the fun, providing vibrancy amid all the sophistication. Finishing with a dash of cardamom, this wine will cellar nicely through 2020."
Italy,89,22,Red Blend,red,Arduini 2011  Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,"This structured ripasso has intense aromas of prune, raisin and graphite. The round and velvety palate offers a ripe blackberry core, spiced by accents of chocolate, mint, tobacco and bitter almond. Pair this with seasoned cheeses or spicy red-meat dishes."
US,84,11,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Parducci 2010 Small Lot Blend Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino County),"This Sauvignon Blanc smells of lemon, vanilla and pear. It's crisp and steely, with sourness on the finish."
France,87,24,Riesling,white,Marc Kreydenweiss 2005 Au Dessus de la Loi Andlau Riesling (Alsace),"An atypical offering, this full-bodied Riesling possessing a slightly oily texture is saturated with a creamy butteryness and earthy essences such as mushroom and truffle. While hints of white peach might surface in the mouth, it is surprisingly easy to take pleasure in its other slightly odd and unexpected characteristics."
France,88,16,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château La Rame 2011  Bordeaux,"Richly textured and spicy, this is a finely integrated wine. It has ripe berry flavors and a palate that's textured with tannins from fruit as well as wood. The structure, held within a lacework of acidity, reflects the wine's potential. Drink from 2016."
US,92,125,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Serene 2013 Récolte Grand Cru Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),"Reflecting the cool 2013 harvest, this top Chardonnay is sophisticated and subtle, without the over-the-top power of the previous vintage. Toasty and tightly wound fruit flavors spotlight apple, pear and citrus, all polished and well-integrated. Barrel fermentation and oak aging add highlights of vanilla and toasted coconut. Delicious already, it will likely improve through 2021."
US,87,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Loft 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"What a great wine for the price. This doesn't have too much tannin, but instead features plenty of tempting black cherry and olive flavors. It's a delicious, dry wine in a classic style."
US,91,36,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Ott & Murphy 2009 Intrépide Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Bordeaux-style blend is 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 29% Petit Verdot and 9% Merlot. The PV shows through in the ripe, textural tannins. The concentrated berry and cassis fruit is annotated with barrel notes of vanilla, coffee and tobacco. This is a hand-crafted wine with distinctive, albeit somewhat rustic, appeal."
US,87,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Pegasus Estate 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"A bit thinner aromatically than some other Cabs, this shows black cherry, tobacco ash, soft cedar and rose petals on the nose. The palate is also relatively light, but offers complex black pepper, thyme, red cherry, turned earth and dried-mint flavors."
US,88,24,Chardonnay,white,Talbott 2011 Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Logan Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is sort of a junior version of Talbott's more expensive Sleepy Hollow Chardonnay. It resembles it in many ways, offering concentrated tropical and citrus fruit flavors, highlighted by brisk acidity and wrapped into a creamy texture."
France,95,120,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Cos d'Estournel 2007  Saint-Estèphe,"With its perfumed aromas, this is a wine that has richness and sweetness, with soft velvet power. It has an intense wood element that needs to blend into the rest of the wine, but the sweet black currant and freshness provide a good balance. This is a seductive wine, with a fine solid character."
France,88,19,Pinot Gris,white,Kuentz-Bas 2014 Tradition Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Very ripe pear fruit is dangerously close to tipping over into cloying richness, almost hinting at cream soda. The palate is less overwhelming. As always, that special streak of Alsace acid saves the day."
France,87,13,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château les Mottes Pradier 2011  Côtes de Bourg,"Solid and tannic, very firm from the opening to the finish. It is based around a dark core of wood and spice as well as more juicy fruit flavors. The wine needs time to round out and bring more of the juiciness to the fore."
US,85,15,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Troon 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon (Applegate Valley),"A firm and fruity effort with some nice toasty elements. Precise and tangy, it offers some ripe berries and cranberries, and a pleasantly toasty finish."
France,91,78,Chardonnay,white,Comtes de Dampierre NV Cuvée General Patton Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"General Patton stayed at the Dampierre estate on his march towards Germany in World War II and this rich Chardonnay is made in his honor. It is a ripe, full-bodied wine that has a tight structure and tense citrus and mineral texture. It makes a strong statement, probably like its namesake."
US,90,50,Merlot,red,The Grapes of Roth 2005 Merlot (Long Island),"Big and brooding with richly concentrated black plums and velvety, mouthfilling tannins, Roman Roth's namesake Merlot is boldly structured, but beautifully nuanced as well, with sprays of violet perfume and just a whiff of wet, earthy forest and dried herb notes. Drink now with a good decant, or hold for another 2–3 years."
US,86,34,Zinfandel,red,Occidental Road Cellars 2007 Helen's Ridge Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Jammy, this Zin has softened and mellowed as it nears five years of age. With raspberry, cherry and cola flavors, it's ready to drink now."
US,90,50,Pinot Noir,red,Roco 2015 The Stalker Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Not a mere whole-cluster wine, the Stalker is made by drying the stalks separately and adding them to whole berries. It's slightly chalky as a result, with a green edge to the tannins and green tea flavors. Black cherry, espresso and cacao components also factor in. Give it another couple of years and drink after 2020."
US,92,31,Pinot Noir,red,Indigené 2012 Edna Valley Pinot Noir (California),"Ripe raspberry, slight minerality, mossy earthiness and a minty lift kick off this offering. On the palate, expect sour cherry, mocha and a pleasing espresso finish bolstered by tingling acidity. Though 2010 was considered a less-than-optimal year, the vintage look like a shining star now that wines like this have had time to come into their own."
Italy,90,19,Red Blend,red,Gagliole 2012 Rubiolo  (Chianti Classico),"Bright and savory, this opens with aromas of blue flowers, mint, dark berry and an earthy whiff of underbrush. The firm palate doles out black cherry, crushed raspberry, peppermint and white pepper alongside firm, sleek tannins. Drink through 2020."
US,88,40,Zinfandel,red,Rosenblum 2013 Rockpile Road Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile),"Bright with a touch of smoky leather, this ripe, full-bodied red is lengthy and lush on the palate, seasoned with black pepper, mocha and blackberry preserve."
US,93,35,Zinfandel,red,St. Amant 2014 Lodi Native Marian's Vineyard Zinfandel (Mokelumne River),"This is one of the best Lodi Native wine yet. It has beautiful, soft, fruit and floral aromas, luxurious and soothing berry and black-currant flavors and a layered texture that seems to melt in the mouth. It's full bodied, braced by fine-grained tannins, and seems to unfold nuance after nuance with each sip before lingering nicely on the finish."
US,88,58,Pinot Noir,red,Arista 2009 Bacigalupi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Tastes young and acidic but weirdly ripe now, with jammy raspberry, cherry and cola flavors and a tart finish. The question is whether it will age. Unlikely, but you never know."
France,84,18,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château la Mothe du Barry 2014 Cuvée Design  (Bordeaux Supérieur),Strawberry fruit flavors dominate this soft wine. It is unfocussed and misses out on clarity and shape.
US,86,90,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Laird 2013 Flat Rock Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Densely packed with black fruit and barrel toast, this wine is mouth-puckering with tannin and power. A lightly perceptible dried herb note weaves through its dark texture."
US,90,25,Chardonnay,white,Chateau St. Jean 2013 Belle Terre Vineyard Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),"A vineyard-designate for the producer since 1975, the fruit shows well in this wine, an exotic tribute to tropical elements and stone fruit like peach, supported by a medium-weighted amount of vanilla oak. The ripeness of the fruit is complemented by endnotes of minerality and herbs."
France,86,13,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Cave de Rasteau 2015 Ortas Les Viguiers Red (Côtes du Rhône),"This blend of 70% Grenache, 20% Carignan and 10% Cinsault smells plummy and superripe, balanced out by hints of crushed stone. It's medium in body and creamy in texture, with nearly overripe flavors that stay just on the fresh side of raisin. Drink now."
US,92,50,Zinfandel,red,Ruby Hill Winery 2012 Jewel Collection Series Estate Reserve Zinfandel (Livermore Valley),"Extremely flavorful and intensely fruity, this wine is exuberant, concentrated, very ripe and very full bodied. But it's also smooth and luscious, light on tannins and so packed with blackberry, blueberry and milk-chocolate flavors that they won't quit on the finish."
US,88,35,White Blend,white,Kontokosta 2013 Anemometer White (North Fork of Long Island),"This rich cream-textured blend of Chardonnay and Viognier evokes warming pastry notes of vanilla, caramel and crème brûlée. It's a dry full-bodied wine with soft acidity and accents of toast, smoke and orange peel."
US,87,13,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Zero One Vintners 2011 Copper Lily Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a broadly fruity, wide open style with fresh melon, pink grapefruit and orange marmalade flavors criss-crossing the palate. It's ready to enjoy right now, low in alcohol, with a touch of marshmallow sweetness to cut the acid."
US,85,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Ascension Cellars 2010 Ethereal Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"The winery is part of the emerging garagiste movement in Paso Robles. It's an ambitious wine, blended with Petite Sirah and Malbec, both of which add complexity. But there's a candied tone to the blackberry flavors that makes it lush and soft."
US,88,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,SuLei 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Yakima Valley),"Fermented in stainless steel, then aged in a mix of neutral oak and stainless steel barrels, this offers a crisp, varietally true style with an emphasis on fruit rather than grassy herbs. Honeydew melon, tangerine and peach roll across the tongue, propelled with fresh, juicy, natural acidity. The wine did not go through (nor did it need) malolactic fermentation. Lively and light-hearted."
US,85,13,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Girasole 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino),"An easygoing, savory wine with penetrating tannins and a pronounced flavor of cranberry. A good go-to pick for a crowd."
US,90,16,Zinfandel,red,Sextant 2013 Zinfandel (Central Coast),"This wine from San Ardo Ranch in the San Lucas appellation wins against Zins twice the price. Black cherry and blackberry aromas meet with sensuous lilacs and wet asphalt on the nose. The palate's cherry juice front quickly turns to tobacco, dried blueberry and a tarry, dried-berry finish."
US,91,35,Syrah,red,MacLaren 2012 Drouthy Neebors Syrah (Sonoma County),"A Syrah from two cooler-climate vineyards that is blended with 24% Zinfandel, this crowd-pleaser is surprisingly complex in thick, meaty tannins and black, brambly fruit. The juiciness of the Zin cuts through the denser aspects of the wine though, with the naturally high acidity keeping everything in check and pleasantly vibrant."
US,86,23,Pinot Noir,red,Husch 2011 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This is a tremendously light Pinot with a bouquet of yellow cherry and cranberry. It's slightly more savory than fruity, expressing the region's cool vintage. The texture of the wine is soft and pleasant with a subtle hint of fuzzy tannins."
US,91,42,Chardonnay,white,Eric Kent 2013 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"From three vineyards, including Roberts Road, this wine impresses in floral honeycomb and a freshness that belies its medium-bodied weight and pithy texture, finishing in vanilla that never gets sweet."
US,92,28,Pinot Noir,red,Byron 2006 Nielson Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A lovely, complex Pinot that shows much of the flair of Byron's more expensive bottlings. The wine is dry and crisp and elegant, with long, deep flavors of currants, cola, sweet leather and dusty Asian spices. Good now, and will develop for at least six years."
US,90,23,Merlot,red,Novelty Hill 2014 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Espresso, dark chocolate, herb and purple fruit aromas lead to a soft, smooth palate in this wine. Fruit and barrel notes play equal parts, yet it comes up short on the finish."
France,91,26,Pinot Gris,white,Domaine Fernand Engel 2013 Gloeckelberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"The bitter-sweet edge of dark fir honey engulfs nose and palate which nonetheless has a core of bright, ripe, juicy and slightly sweet pear. The sweetness sings with that bitter tinge. This is rich but fresh and balanced and leaves with an off-dry aftertaste of more honey."
US,88,8,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Al 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey County),"Made by the team at Wrath, this is one of the better canned wines on the shelves right now. Light in the glass, it offers very refreshing, mineral-driven aromas of wet riverstone and rain on cement as well as slight touches of Pink Lady apples and green hay. Asian pear flesh mixes with slightly sour lime peel and sweet chives on the palate."
France,88,38,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château la Tour de By 2012  Médoc,"The dominance of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend of this structured wine gives strong tannins and tight black currant fruit at this young stage. It has good potential, however, a solid and powerful wine that needs several years. Drink from 2018."
US,92,32,Chardonnay,white,Array 2011 Dijon Clone Chardonnay (Yakima Valley),"Sourced entirely from the Otis Harlan Vineyard, these vines were planted about 25 years ago. It's a pleasure to see them singled out for this showcase bottling. It's a rich, oily, nutty, buttery style to be sure, but also dense with ripe apple, pear and peach fruit. The acidity buoys it up throughout a strong, long finish."
US,88,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Wölffer 2013 Fatalis Fatum Red (Long Island),"Black-cherry and currant flavors are concentrated but restrained in this full-bodied Bordeaux-style blend. Smoky, woody and a bit savory in style, it's abundantly oaky but should balance out neatly from 2020. Bold tannins and brisk acidity mark the finish."
US,88,27,Pinot Noir,red,Johan Vineyards 2005 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Young, tight, firm and somewhat acidic, this is one Pinot Noir that needs decanting. Like the other releases from Johan, it is a subtle wine that rewards your attention. Details of fruit, earth, rock and herb emerge slowly as the wine opens, suggesting that a few bottles should be tucked away in the cellar for future reference."
US,89,34,Pinot Noir,red,Melville 2011 Estate Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Give this wine credit for sheer exuberance. It's a mélange of cherries, root beer, sweet mushu plum sauce and smoky sandalwood, folded into soft, smooth tannins, and brightened with acidity. Textbook coastal Pinot Noir for drinking now."
US,94,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Blue Rock 2007 Best Barrels Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Shows the softness and herbal quality that mark Alexander Valley Cabernet, in the best sense. The wine feels fine and beautiful in the mouth, with the complexity and elegance to pair with great food. Delightful for its cherry, berry, currant, cola and oak flavors. Great now, and should develop over the next five years."
US,91,17,Pinot Gris,white,Ponzi 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"This leesy and creamy yet bracing wine reveals abundant melon, citrus and pear fruit flavors. Balance and finesse are on full display, as always the case in Luisa Ponzi's wines."
US,91,28,Chardonnay,white,Alma Rosa 2014 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Quite light and restrained on the nose, this bottling from Richard and Thekla Sanford shows pithy Key lime and scratched grapefruit-skin aromas. There is a decent sizzle of acidity to the palate, with lime rinds, pith and juice playing together. Touches of almond and flint add interest."
US,90,56,Pinot Noir,red,Pali 2012 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Given ample time in oak, this wine delivers size and strength, a feisty celebration of big blackberry fruit and muscular tannins, well representative of both the vineyard and the vintage. Strawberry, mushroom and truffle figure prominently, with a finish of black tea."
US,91,32,Chardonnay,white,Shannon Ridge 2015 Red Hills Ranch Reserve Chardonnay (Lake County),"Unabashedly buttery and oaky in aroma and flavor, this first-class, full-bodied wine has a mouth-filling, creamy texture that lingers long into the finish. It starts with buttered toast and almond aromas and opens into a rich pear-and-hazelnut palate, its flavors unfolding in nuanced layers."
US,91,52,Pinot Noir,red,Arista 2010 Perli Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge),"Thick and foresty, this Pinot Noir embodies the extremes of the Perli Vineyard. It bursts with dark blue and earthy red fruits that are tempered by a savory undertone. This wine takes time to reveal itself, so age it for 5–7 years, and pair it with stews, risottos or seasoned braised lamb."
US,89,14,Pinot Noir,red,Stone Wolf 2012 Barrel Select Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is a toasty, tasty, forward and easy-drinking Pinot Noir. Flavors of black cherry soda, cola and light toast are front and center, and the finish comes on clean and refreshing."
France,84,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Clos Bourbon 2012  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux,"The wine is soft, just juicy and with little in the way of concentration. Barrel-aged for 12 months in one-third new oak, it is attractive and ready to drink now. Vines are planted on limestone and clay above limestone and iron schist subsoil."
US,90,24,White Blend,white,Uvaggio 2015 Zelo Bianco White (Carneros),"This proprietary blend combines 63% Pinot Grigio from Carneros, 22% Traminer from Carneros and a small percentage of Moscato Giallo from Lodi. Together they harmonize in a light, crisp and floral bouquet of apricot, ginger and lemon, never becoming overly fussy and instead focusing entirely on refined refreshment."
Italy,87,20,Pinot Grigio,white,Collavini 2014 Villa Canlungo Pinot Grigio (Collio),"This vibrant Pinot Grigio offers delicate scents of white flower, orchard fruit and a whiff of citrus. The crisp palate shows crunchy Granny Smith apple, green pear and tangerine while bracing acidity gives it a clean finish."
US,90,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Barons V 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Matthew Loso makes excellent Sauvignon Blanc, and this is no exception. Smooth, lush and creamy, it's bursting with concentrated fruit flavors of apple, peach and papaya—definitely not a grassy style by any measure. Everything points to barrel fermentation, including the lick of fresh cream in the finish."
France,86,13,Chardonnay,white,Domaine du Colombier 2015 Chardonnay (Val de Loire),"This creamy wine has soft fruit flavors and light acidity. It has a touch of spice as well as pear and melon fruits. The texture is warm, ripe and rounded with just enough acidity at the end to keep the wine buoyant. Drink now."
US,92,29,Zinfandel,red,Seven Angels 2012 St. Peter of Alcantara Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Coming from a vineyard named after the patron saint of night watchmen, this wine offers luxurious purple aromas of blackberry-vanilla sauce and dark chocolate. The palate is sticky and singing with coffee, milk chocolate and dried cherries, showing plenty of deep tannins and boisterous acidity that will make this bottling last a while."
France,91,26,White Blend,white,Domaine Rotier 2014 Les Gravels White (Gaillac),"This wine is dense and structured, showing it this is still a work in progress. It has richness rather than huge sweetness with a dry core of botrytis. Bitter honey and spice go with the ripe yellow fruit flavors. Drink from 2018."
France,91,60,Chardonnay,white,Joseph Perrier NV Cuvée Royale Brut Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (Champagne),"With five years' bottle aging, this Champagne is just beginning to show some attractive signs of maturity. The toasty aroma is followed through on the palate and this toastiness has softened the tight mineral texture of the wine. Drink this balanced wine now."
US,91,65,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Pepper Bridge 2013 Trine Estate Vineyards Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Cabernet Sauvignon (37%) and Cabernet Franc (34%) make up the majority of this wine, with the balance Merlot (16%), Malbec (8%) and Petit Verdot. The aromas are quite locked up, with light notes of barrel spice, herb and assorted dark fruit. The palate has light tightly coiled fruit flavors. It needs time to reveal its charms. Best after 2021."
US,86,14,Riesling,white,Lucas Vineyards 2013 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Dusty, savory mineral and earth tones go head-to-head with fresh apple, lemon and lime notes in this crisp dry Riesling. It's a refreshing everyday wine marked by spine tingling acidity—a perfect pairing for creamy cheeses and rich braises. Drink now."
US,92,45,Pinot Noir,red,Sean Thackrey 2010 Cassiopeia Wentzel Vineyard Clone 114 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Bolinas-based Sean Thackrey's new project, Cassiopeia is centered on one block from a single Anderson Valley vineyard. His quest was to see what four different Pinot Noir clones on one rootstock, all the same age, and treated otherwise similarly, could become once turned into wine. This, the 114, is lightly rendered, though deceptively full and meaty, tasting of dark cherry and herb."
France,91,58,Pinot Noir,red,Bouchard Père & Fils 2007 Clos de la Mousse Premier Cru  (Beaune),"Bold brush strokes characterize this wine, the fruit a complex mélange of red berries, acidity and weight. The wine has good density, offering a strawberry jam character to go with the fresh edge. Tannins are enveloped in the fruits, promising medium-term aging."
US,88,50,Chardonnay,white,Lynmar 2011 Divinity Late Harvest Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This sugary-sweet dessert Chardonnay tries hard to please, offering waves of honey, tangerine, mango and vanilla flavors. It's tantalizingly delicious, but could be just a tad more concentrated, especially at this price."
US,91,48,Pinot Noir,red,WillaKenzie Estate 2012 Aliette Pinot Noir,"This selection is from the winery's first planted vineyard, now nearing 20 years of age. It's all Pommard clone, offering a burst of pretty cherry fruit backed with stiff tannins and a streak of iron. Still showing some sharp edges, it's just out of 15 months in 50% new oak, and will benefit from aerating or further bottle age."
US,89,39,Pinot Noir,red,La Fenêtre 2008 Los Alamos Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"This enormously rich, extracted Pinot Noir will please flavor-forward fans. It's explosive in raspberries, cherries, cola, figs, bacon, orange zest and other umami tastes, wrapped into a silky texture and brightened with crisp acidity. Seems best now and for a year or two."
US,89,14,Chardonnay,white,Three Rivers 2013 Steel Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Steel is the medium and the message, meaning it's completely unoaked, with no malolactic fermentation. The flavors are spicy and bright, mixing cucumber, mint and green melon with a dash of white pepper."
US,93,48,Syrah,red,Ila 2014 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"This new project by wine bar owner Ash Mehta and winemaker Mary Bradley shows much promise, starting with woody elderberry, tar, black pepper and dense lavender on the buoyant nose. The sip starts with powerful pepper and then coalesces around cassis and black-currant fruit, a tarry minerality, dried herbs of thyme and juniper and a cocoa finish."
France,88,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Haut-Macô 2010  Côtes de Bourg,"Showing the typical power and concentration of the 2010 vintage, this is a dense and structured wine. Good acidity and black plum flavors show through the big tannic texture and dry core. The wine still needs to age so drink from 2018. This is a 60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc blend from Mallet Frères."
US,86,32,Zinfandel,red,Iron Hub 2013 Esola Zinfandel (Amador County),"Rather light, easy-to-enjoy aromas suggesting fresh strawberry and raspberry, along with equally fruity flavors don't indicate how full-bodied and high-octane this wine is. Still, it has a smooth texture and lingering finish."
US,88,34,Merlot,red,Foundry Vineyards 2012 Merlot (Red Mountain),"All varietal from up-and-coming Scooteney Flats Vineyard, this wine displays aromas of fresh herbs, dark raspberries and barrel spices. There's no lack of richness to the fruit flavors but the chalky tannins need time to stitch together."
France,89,50,Pinot Noir,red,Louis Latour 2005 Domaine Latour  (Aloxe-Corton),"From its own estate, this Louis Latour wine is a ripe, strawberry- and juicy plum-flavored wine, sustained by a well- judged dry layer of tannins. It is sweet, the acidity showing through in the red fruits."
US,91,35,Chardonnay,white,Wrights Station 2013 Backwards Block Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Impressively delicate but also generous in aromas, this bottling shows lemon curd, caramelized apple and a touch of baby powder on the nose. There's a sharp line of salty acidity on the palate, with flavors of candied apple and Meyer lemon."
US,94,40,Syrah,red,Rôtie Cellars 2012 Northern Blend Syrah (Washington),"Don't let the Washington State label fool you. This Walla Walla Valley Rocks-region wine shows complex notes of roasted meat, blue fruit, earth, mineral, smoke and herbs. It's full bodied and rich with a dazzlingly polished feel to the fruit and savory flavors capped off by a long, meat-filled finish—beautiful stuff."
US,92,95,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Chimney Rock 2011 Elevage Red (Stags Leap District),"A Merlot-based blend with accompanying components of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, this estate-grown wine excels in its subdued, smoky and toasty oak surrounded by juicy blackberry and a hint of graphite and leather. Textured and structured, it needs time, and will be happy in the cellar through 2026."
US,89,58,Red Blend,red,Stags' Leap Winery 2013 The Investor Red (Napa Valley),"This new blend features 38% Merlot, 32% Petite Sirah, 18% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Malbec, combining brawn with beauty. Red fruit and a light grip of oak wrap around a softly textured body, making for an approachable, easygoing experience."
France,88,24,Chardonnay,white,Domaine André Bonhomme 2013 Cuvée Spéciale  (Viré-Clessé),"This wine is full of rich fruit. With apricots, mangos and a layer of caramel, this is a generous wine with enough acidity to sustain its richness. The aftertaste brings in spice, vanilla and a squeeze of lemon."
Italy,88,60,Red Blend,red,Capezzana 2009 Ghiaie della Furba Red (Toscana),"A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 30% Syrah, this opens with aromas of espresso, toasted oak, ground pepper, ripe black-skinned fruit and game. The extracted palate offers licorice, raisin, clove and tobacco alongside raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish. The fruit is starting to dry up so drink sooner rather than later."
US,85,10,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Healdsburg Ranches 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Good price for a nice, dry Cabernet with so much fruit. It's forward in ripe blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam flavors, with a rich coat of smoky oak."
US,94,55,Syrah,red,Gramercy 2010 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This classy Syrah opens with a note of pretty funkiness, wrapped around stiff, tight, rather herbal flavors. The berry flavor is ripe but in no way jammy. Here the emphasis is on nuance, earthiness and herbal details."
US,93,56,Merlot,red,Pride Mountain 2006 Merlot (Sonoma-Napa),"Made in the Pride style, this is a big, powerful wine that should age well. It's enormously ripe, with flamboyant cassis, cherry pie filling, milk chocolate, licorice and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into thoroughly modern, softly refined tannins. Just beautiful, and should develop through 2012."
US,96,245,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Jarvis 2006 Estate Grown Cave Fermented Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This reserve tastes oakier and stronger than Jarvis's regular 2006 Cabernet. With near-perfect balance, this is awesome. Flavors of blackberries and black currants are complexed with minerals and herbs and indefinable things from the soil. It's hard in tannins and rich in spicy, smoky new oak. Hold until at least 2014, and it should continue to age well beyond that."
US,92,27,Chardonnay,white,Forgeron 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Roughly half of the blend is made from fruit that comes from 30-year-old vines. An addition of 6% Muscat adds a scent of tree fruit, and the lovely citrus and stone fruit flavors are enhanced by a fresh-baked bread note. It has excellent concentration and impeccable balance, plus a long, satisfying finish."
US,86,26,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Ojai 2010 McGinley Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"Strong notes of lemongrass and pineapple jam mark this Sauvignon Blanc. It has a nice cut of acidity. While it's not particularly subtle, this is ready to drink now as a cocktail."
US,90,25,Zinfandel,red,Decoy 2012 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Smoothly seductive in bright red-berry and pomegranate fruit, this young Zinfandel comes from mostly Dry Creek Valley vineyards. Rippling in baking spice and subtle vanilla oak, it's a complete wine, with balanced acidity and mellowed tannins. Clean and long on the finish, it will complement rather than overpower a meal."
US,93,48,Pinot Noir,red,Arista 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The winery's larger offering from several vineyard sites, this wine is designed entirely to please, offering a seductively juicy abundance in black cherry, raspberry and cinnamon. Approachable and full bodied, the tannins are soft and the oak well integrated, allowing the earthy aromas and spicy brown-sugar elements to roam free."
Italy,91,28,Sangiovese,red,Castello di Radda 2012 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Underbrush, tilled earth, leather, ripe berry and a whiff of baking spice aromas meld together on this fragrant wine. The savory, refined palate offers juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and a tobacco note framed in firm, polished tannins. Drink through 2020."
France,89,43,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Domaine La Consonnière 2010 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"This is a bit tarry at first, but gradually opens up to reveal slightly herbal fruit notes of cassis and hints of olive and tomato—very Provençal. It's silky on the finish, so it's easy to drink now and over the next 5–6 years."
US,91,95,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Sebastiani 2008 Cherryblock Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"This is the most expensive newly released Cherryblock ever, $20 more than the 2007. It's quite a plush wine, softly velvety and rich in cherry and oak flavors. Already throwing considerable sediment, it's on the glidepath to a long, useful life."
France,84,11,Pinot Noir,red,Le Petit Cochonnet 2015 Pinot Noir (Pays d'Oc),"A light, easy and cheery selection, with direct aromas and flavors of sweet cherry, red raspberry and strawberry. The mouthfeel is soft and approachable, with virtually no tannins and a clean, short finish. Drink up."
US,90,38,Syrah,red,Lost Canyon 2008 Trenton Station Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Impenetrably black in color and very tannic, this is a big, aloof Syrah. It's bone dry and hard to appreciate now, with elusive blackberry fruit that surfaces briefly, then disappears into a hard finish. The vineyard is in the cool, damp southern part of the valley. Kudos to Lost Canyon for holding it back this long, but it still needs time. Try after 2016."
France,85,17,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Pezat 2013  Bordeaux Blanc,"Herbaceous, crisp and fruity, this fresh wine has citrus, juicy apple and a hint of yellow fruits as well as bright acidity. It's totally ready to drink."
Italy,90,54,Red Blend,red,Arnaldo Caprai 2008 Riserva  (Montefalco Rosso),"Here's a delicious blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Sagrantino. It delivers high-tone aromas of pressed violets, red berry and spice. The palate offers succulent black cherry and creamy raspberry flavors that are brightened by white pepper and cinnamon accents."
US,90,60,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Matthews 2012 Reserve Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (78%), with the rest equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Aromas of barrel spice, cedar, green herbs and black fruit are followed by tightly coiled fruit and barrel flavors that need some time to settle in."
US,89,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Pepper Bridge 2013 Estate Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"High-toned aromas of black fruit, barrel spice and herb lead to a wound up palate backed by lightly grainy tannins. It's almost four years old, but still seems to need time to settle in. Best after 2020."
Italy,91,25,Sangiovese,red,Le Bèrne 2012  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,"This 100% Sangiovese opens with pretty aromas of iris, violet, dark berry and a blend of cooking spices. On the palate, ground black pepper, anise and espresso accent a core of dried black cherry while tightly knit, assertive tannins provide backup. Drink 2017–2022."
France,91,31,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Pierre Morin 2015 Le Chant de l'Orme  (Sancerre),"The song of the elm is the poetic name of this wine. It is a rich wine, dense with fruit and with some toast from the wood aging. It is impressive with its ripe swathes of fruit and its spicy aftertaste. The wine is just ready to drink although it will be better from 2018."
US,84,23,Red Blend,red,Bota Box 2013 RedVolution Red (California),"This is good and grapy from the fresh berry aroma to the juicy, slightly sweet cherry flavor, to the soft texture with just a hint of crispness. An accent of smoky spiciness in the aromas and the aftertaste adds extra interest."
US,82,30,Merlot,red,Marilyn Merlot 2012 Merlot (Napa Valley),"There's a rubbery denseness to this wine, a curious, not entirely pleasant mix of red currant and burnt leather that may or may not integrate over time."
France,86,20,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Les Vignobles Foncalieu 2009 La Réserve du Crouzau St. Gervais Red (Côtes du Rhône Villages),"A solid, medium-bodied effort, this Saint Gervais boasts fine complexity on the nose, where it mixes berries with smoke and olive before turning darker on the palate, finally ending with hints of bitter chocolate and espresso."
US,83,25,Zinfandel,red,Rosenblum 2005 Richard Sauret Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Hot, soft and uninteresting. It's not a bad wine, being clean and somewhat dry, but that softness results in a serious absence of structure, and there's not enough fruity essence to compensate."
US,92,42,Zinfandel,red,V. Sattui 2011 Black Sears Vineyard Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"The Black Sears Vineyard has been source to some of Napa's most impressive Zinfandels over the years, for a number of wineries, including Sattui. With this 2011, they've outdone themselves. The wine is so succulent in black cherry, licorice and mocha flavors, it's hard to resist drinking it all right now. Yes, the alcohol is on the high side, but that's the price of such richness."
US,85,24,Riesling,white,Phillips Hill 2016 Greenwood Ridge Vineyard Riesling (Mendocino Ridge),"This light-bodied wine is a bit sweet and sugary, balanced by crisp apple flavors and a tangy touch of acidity. It's good and thirst-quenching."
US,89,36,Syrah,red,Bunnell 2008 Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"Still quite closed, this wine has a wealth of French oak toast and spices alongside dark berries. It's silky and restrained but with great depth of flavors and intensity."
US,87,16,Chardonnay,white,Buehler 2010 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Sweet oak and jammy fruit dominate this Chardonnay. Made in the popular style, its buttered toast, orange marmalade and honey flavors—all brightened with acidity—will find widespread appeal."
US,86,28,Zinfandel,red,Zina Hyde Cunningham 2004 Old Vine Zinfandel (Redwood Valley),"A soft, luscious Zin, dry and firm in tannins, with forward flavors of raspberries, cherries, almond biscotti, mocha and dusty spices. Drink now."
US,90,32,Pinot Noir,red,Loring Wine Company 2013 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Fresh black cherries and a bit of licorice are laced through the nose of this appellation blend by single-vineyard star Brian Loring. The palate is all about exotic spice, from ginger and black sage to anise seeds and cola, also showing some umami flavors reminiscent of shiitake mushrooms."
US,91,48,Pinot Noir,red,Failla 2013 Keefer Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Light in color and weight, this vineyard-designate conveys a wealth of rose petals, earth and bright, crisp red cherry. Compellingly layered and shy, it defines the term ethereal. The finish is medium in length and accented in spicy cardamom."
US,86,20,Sangiovese,red,Righteous 2008 Righteous Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Front-loaded fruit has a strawberry soda pop flavor, but the wine gains a little extra depth from the tannins and barrels, which add texture, spice and a bit of salty chocolate."
US,91,35,Syrah,red,Culton 2013 Syrah (Paso Robles Willow Creek District),"A seductive nose draws one in with tar, soy sauce, densely packed violets and blackberries on this bottling by Terry Culton. Tart and woody squashed elderberries pop on the palate, which is quite dense and also offers soy and dark-chocolate flavors."
US,87,15,Zinfandel,red,Zinsane 2013 Zinfandel (Lodi),"Ripeness and richness reign over this full-bodied, almost-sweet wine. Oaky, maple-syrup aromas and lots of black cherry and boysenberry flavors partner with a smooth, posh texture. Think of it almost like a Port, but drier and not quite so high in alcohol."
US,88,55,Pinot Noir,red,Bernardus 2010 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Big, bold flavors of cherry pie, red currant, toasty oak and vanilla mark this ripe, tasty Pinot. It has broad appeal, successfully made for a palate that likes accessibile wines that seem sweet and fruity."
US,87,55,Pinot Noir,red,Fess Parker 2013 Pommard Clone Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This clonal study blends rich black cherry and sassafras notes with cola, savory herbs, strong iron and slight scorched rubber aromas. The palate jumps from a red cherry and cranberry tartness right into a toasted sage and pencil-lead character."
US,92,40,Syrah,red,William Church 2013 Red Willow Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Coming from one of the state's top Syrah sites, this wine starts out quite aromatically closed up, with notes of brambly blue fruit and herbs, along with whiffs of orange peel and smoked meat. The flavors, in contrast, pop with electric notes of dark plum and huckleberry and lingering undercurrents of smoked meat and orange rind. Give it some time to open up and it delivers."
US,88,26,Riesling,white,Bloomer Creek 2013 Tanzen Dame Auten Vineyard Clone 239 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Fragrant spring blossoms are dusted with pollen on the nose of this delicate dry Riesling. It's intensely mineral, meshing dusty earth tones against crisp apple and lime flavors. Racy and lithe, it finishes briskly."
US,85,26,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,TimberRock 2005 Phinney Hill Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington),"The fruit is forward and tart, mixing berries, cherries and plums; and the tannins almost disappear in a pillowy cloud. Up front this is a delicious wine, that seems to disappear in the middle and then return for a spicy flourish in the finish, marred a bit by a dominating chalkiness and a hint of dill."
Italy,87,37,White Blend,white,Zuani 2011 Riserva White (Collio),"Oak dominates this blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon and Pinot Grigio. Aromas of toasted wood, butterscotch, lemon zest and walnut carry over to the palate alongside yellow apple."
France,92,29,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Fonréaud 2014  Listrac-Médoc,"This is a rich stylish wine from the Chanfreau family. It has fine tannins and signs of wood aging, both of which will meld into the juicy black-currant fruits. It has a predominance of Cabernet Sauvignon that gives the wine its structure and aging potential. The aftertaste is ripe and still crisp, still young. Drink from 2020."
US,88,18,White Blend,white,Monte Volpe 2012 Nube Bianco White (Potter Valley),"This white blend of Vermentino, Moscato Giallo, Fiano and Pinot Grigio is elegant and austere with notes of lemon and grass. Herbal and fresh, it shines with Vermentino's distinct personality. This is a unique white blend from Mendocino with Italian roots that's definitely worth trying."
France,88,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Moulin de Canhaut 2012  Médoc,"A ripe, juicy and fruity wine, this is already softening. Plenty of rounded Merlot flavors are stiffened by the wood-aging spices and the stalky black currant character of Cabernet. Drink this structured wine from 2018."
US,91,80,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Robledo 2006 Fifth Edition Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Made in the modern cult style, this Cabernet is softly luscious, oaky and enormously rich. It shows ripe, almost sweet flavors of blackberries, raspberries and cassis, and ends with a spicy finish. A big, powerfully luscious wine that could pick up bottle complexities over the next few years."
US,94,75,Pinot Noir,red,Walt 2014 Brown Ranch Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Brooding and dark, this softly structured wine is juicy and brimming in tension, its acidity focused and supportive. Black cherry, a subtle touch of cinnamon spice and toasted oak find balance and equal more than the sum of their parts, providing for a luxurious experience in the glass."
US,85,14,Riesling,white,Foris 2012 Estate Grown Riesling (Rogue Valley),"An aromatic wine with notes of freshly cut red apple, overripe pear and jasmine. The palate drinks closer to dry than the aromas might suggest, with a phenolic feel."
US,91,55,Pinot Noir,red,Aubichon Cellars 2013 Riverside Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Situated in the McMinnville AVA, this vineyard delivers a sleek, well-proportioned wine. Though tight and unyielding at first, it is aromatically promising, with a mix of rose petals, berries and chocolate. Those flavors expand as it breathes open, finishing with the AVA's characteristic gun-metal minerality. Drink 2018–2028."
Italy,86,11,Pinot Grigio,white,Altùris 2011 Pinot Grigio (Venezia Giulia),"This is a value white, with fresh tones of citrus, pear and stone fruit. Zesty crispness marks the finish, making it perfect for smoked salmon with cream cheese."
US,85,14,Sauvignon Blanc,white,River Star 2012 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),"Flavors of ripe tropical fruit, citrus and green apple mark this crisp Sauvignon Blanc. It finishes dry, despite a burst of honey in the middle."
US,86,24,Pinot Noir,red,Bianchi 2007 Signature Selection Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Growing a little tired, with the raspberry, cherry and persimmon fruit beginning to dry out. Yet the wine is clean and sprightly in acidity."
US,87,22,Syrah,red,Arbor Crest 2010 Three Vineyards Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wide open Syrah shows berry and heavy vanilla notes. As the flavors wind through the palate, the back end seems to tighten up, and it finishes with a somewhat green, lightly herbal flourish."
France,90,51,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Clos Fourtet 2000  Saint-Émilion,"This was the last vintage at Clos Fourtet under the ownership of the Lurtons. They made fine wine, but the potential of the property was never quite realized. The wine just fails to excite: it is rich and concentrated with ripe tannins and some sweetness, but at the same time, there is a layer of acidity and structure which gives the wine a firm, solid shape."
US,94,39,Zinfandel,red,Sineann 2009 Old Vine Zinfandel (Columbia Valley (OR)),"Old-vine Oregon Zinfandel is not common; in fact, this is all of them. From the Pines Vineyard, planted around a century ago, revived in the 1980s, these wines have a power and unique presence that sets them apart from Zin from anywhere else. Ultraripe fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry jam, alcohol above 15%, amazing density and beautifully managed tannins, with some sweet grain flavors that say “old vines.”"
Italy,87,19,Red Blend,red,Castello d'Albola 2013  Chianti Classico,"Pretty scents of woodland berry, fragrant purple flower and baking spice float out of the glass. The vibrant, straightforward palate offers crushed wild cherry, white pepper and a hint of star anise alongside bright acidity and sleek tannins."
US,88,25,Red Blend,red,The Conqueror 2014 Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"This easy-drinking blend of 33% Cabernet Franc, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Syrah and 17% Merlot opens with blue fruit, herb and spice aromas and leads to sweet, plush fruit and barrel flavors. Lightly grainy tannins provide structure."
US,87,42,Pinot Noir,red,Lemelson 2005 Meyer Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"It opens with sweet/tart raspberry fruit, a streamlined, well-defined wine underscored by tart, citrusy acids. It does not show the harmonious complexity of the blends, but it is a very pleasant wine, soft and approachable, sweet and smooth. A bit one-dimensional; it begins with fresh berry fruit, tosses in a hint of cherry tobacco, and leaves a slightly earthy impression in the finish, but fails to move in the mouth."
US,86,25,Chardonnay,white,Standing Stone 2013 Ice Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Hints of cream and vanilla lend warmth to savory pressed apples and pears in this slightly rustic ice-style wine. It's rich and silky on the palate with bright, pleasing acidity."
US,95,25,Chardonnay,white,Au Bon Climat 2007 Los Alamos Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"Massively fruity and oaky, this is an atom bomb of a Chardonnay. You either love this style or you hate it. The pineapple tart, apricot, pear, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors go on and on. Beyond the utter richness is firm acidity and a bracing minerality. Defines California-style decadence, but drink now, as the wine will quickly go downhill."
US,89,32,Syrah,red,Amavi 2013 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Les Collines and Stone Valley fruit make up 75% of this wine with the rest coming from Seven Hills, Pepper Bridge and Summit View. It offers generous aromas of blueberry puree, dried herbs, red fruit, woodspice, dried flowers and mineral. The flavors bring the same but are more pulled-back than the aromas suggest, with a bit of astringency that holds the wine back."
US,88,29,Chardonnay,white,V. Sattui 2013 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Floral streaks of orange blossom open this wine, followed by vibrant bursts of lemon. Estate grown, produced and bottled, this fresh, balanced wine picks up weight on the finish, ending with a ripeness of voluptuous apple and oak."
US,92,24,Zinfandel,red,Jelly Jar 2006 Nova Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (Lake County),"If you like the spicy, wild berry character of Zinfandel, you'll love this one. It's dry and crisp and medium-bodied, with a blast of forest-picked cherries, raspberries, blackberries and mulberries, accented with cocoa, tangerine zest, pepper and Asian spices. Really lip-smackingly delicious."
US,92,36,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Folkway 2007 Black Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"A beautiful Cabernet, well structured, dry and rich. It feels soft and inviting in the mouth, with waves of ripe blackberries and cassis, and the fine tannins that accompany a good mountain red wine. Contains some Cabernet Franc, which adds cherry richness. Drink now for maximum freshness."
Italy,84,11,Pinot Grigio,white,Barone Fini 2002 Pinot Grigio (Valdadige),"Light and easy to drink, with just enough apple and lime to keep things interesting. Makes a fine apéritif."
US,85,29,Zinfandel,red,6 North 2009 The Big Cat Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A rugged, fierce wine, brusque in tannins, that needs big, rich meats and oils to balance it out. Short ribs and similar fare will play well against the blackberry and raisin flavors of this high-alcohol Zin."
US,91,16,Syrah,red,Andrew Murray 2009 Tous les Jours Syrah (Central Coast),"Shows class and elegance in the dryness, astringent tannins and crisp acidity that frame the blackberry, blueberry, teriyaki beef and spice flavors. The astringency is an integral part of the wine's structure. Drink this over the next six years with rich lamb, game and beef dishes."
US,91,30,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Soos Creek 2013 Artist Series #13 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is an equal split between Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Heady black cherry and dark-fruit aromas lead to pitch-black-fruit flavors, with the tannins combed to a fine sheen."
US,86,100,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Okapi 2013 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Syrupy and dense, this wine is jammy in plum and vanilla, with indeterminate structure and plenty of oak. Ripe and full-bodied, it has accents of graphite and leather."
US,90,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Brandlin 2011 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"Solely from Mount Veeder, this Cabernet Sauvignon has small percentages of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. The trio combine to offer currant and cranberry around a complex, woody core of oak, black tea and herbs."
US,87,30,Merlot,red,Marilyn 2010 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This shows the softness and red cherry flavors of a nice Merlot, with rich Napa tannins and a hint of green mint. It's a clean, dry wine for drinking now."
US,92,75,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Westerly 2010 Fletcher's Red Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),A balance of blueberry-chiffon ripeness and asphalt tightness is enhanced by spearmint and cola notes on the nose of this blend from eastern Santa Ynez Valley. The palate shows generous black fruit against a restrained tannic frame of tobacco and cedar.
Italy,89,60,Red Blend,red,Mazzei 2011 Castello Fonterutoli Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),"Aromas of roasted coffee bean, toast, oak-driven spice, ripe berry and scorched earth lead the nose. The firm palate offers black cherry extract, espresso, licorice, oak and coconut alongside assertive, grippy tannins. Still oak driven and tightly tannic, give this a few years to fully develop but then drink to capture the remaining fruit richness. Drink 2017–2021."
US,91,22,Chardonnay,white,Cambria 2013 Katherine's Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"This wine offers caramelized apple, seared pear, honeysuckle, a touch of buttercream and vanilla ice cream on the even, well-measured nose. The flavors lean more green but not underripe, with lime juice, green apple and green mango, offering some bitterness and an alkaline/iodine character."
US,86,56,Red Blend,red,Ledson 2014 Caudalies Red (Sonoma Valley),"Rich, plummy and oaky, this wine combines 52% Zinfandel and 48% Petite Sirah. The two varieties pack a punch of intensity and a plush mouthfeel, finishing with a touch of heat."
US,86,39,Syrah,red,Nola 2006 White Hawk Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Bone dry and firmly tannic, this Syrah has a peppery edge to the blackberry, currant and tamari flavors. It could be more focused and concentrated. Drink now."
France,90,35,Pinot Noir,red,Roger et Didier Raimbault 2014  Sancerre,"A ripe and rich wine, this is full of jammy red fruits. The structure is well integrated into the fruits, giving a smooth, ripe wine that's developing attractively. With a juicy, fresh aftertaste, it is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017."
US,86,30,Zinfandel,red,Ironstone 2010 Reserve Rous Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"A distinct late-harvest character pervades this full-bodied Zin, which has very ripe aromas of raisins and prunes, and bold, dried-fruit flavors, too. The texture is smooth and the wine is soft and not very tannic."
France,87,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Saintongey 2011 Les Hauts de Palette Vieilles Vignes  (Bordeaux),This is a perfumed wine with eucalyptus aromas and new wood flavors. The wood element is held in balance by flavors of ripe berry fruits and delicate acidity. Keep this wine until 2015.
US,91,21,Syrah,red,Lynch Wines 2012 Strummer Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"Sweet oak perfume comes from 25% new French barrels. The oak influence is well integrated with ripe fruit, firm tannins, good concentration and medium-full body. They add up to an enticing, complex and delicious wine that is very lively, a bit lean, and will age through at least 2019."
US,92,95,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Serene 2015 Coeur Blanc (White Heart) Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This was the first winery to make a truly white Pinot Noir (back in 2004). Produced exclusively from Pommard clones, it's barrel fermented and aged much like a Chardonnay. Along with great texture and length, there's plenty of acid supporting its palate-pleasing mix of white peach, melon and gooseberry. It finishes with a thread of lightly buttery caramel."
France,91,40,Chardonnay,white,Vollereaux NV Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"This ripe Chardonnay has a significant amount of reserve wine from older vintages in the blend. It is on the dry side of Brut, with a mineral, steely texture. That is balanced by the maturity of this bottling, giving hints of toast and ripe, sliced apple flavors."
US,90,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Circadia 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This wine has an exotic, perfumed component to its beginning bouquet, spicy jolts of cinnamon and cardamom around the more classic clove. Juicy and creamy in texture, it offers blackberry, plum and licorice and is approachably easy to enjoy."
US,91,30,Chardonnay,white,Kendall-Jackson 2012 Jackson Estate Camelot Highlands Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Lemon butter, apple pie crust and hazelnut are first to the aroma party on this carefully crafted Jackson family offering from a vineyard about 400 feet up in limestone-dotted soils. On the palate, strong but integrated acidity carries the myriad citrus, apple and spice flavors to completion."
US,89,16,White Blend,white,Bergevin Lane 2007 Calico White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"An excellent version of this wine, mixing together 39% Chardonnay, 31% Roussanne and 30% Viognier. It was half stainless and half barrel fermented, combined to deliver crisp, racy flavors of lemon cucumber, pineapple, citrus rind and a hint of pepper. Overall this is a very bright and nicely defined wine."
Italy,86,12,White Blend,white,Tasca d'Almerita 2007 Regaleali White (Sicilia),"Here is a delicately fragrant blend of Sicilian grapes with pretty tones of white flower, acacia, kiwi and peach. This competitively priced wine is fresh and light and would make a perfect pairing with tuna salad or salmon carpaccio."
France,88,10,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Barton & Guestier 2016 Passeport Bordeaux Blanc by Laurent Prada  (Bordeaux Blanc),"Lightly perfumed, this soft, ripe wine has attractive acidity that is balanced by ripe yellow- and white-stone fruits. The acidity at the end is just right. Drink now."
US,93,65,Red Blend,red,Renwood 2012 Red (Amador County),This wine shows an almost-black core with a red rim. Jammy blackberry aromas lead to rich and mouth-coating fruit flavors that are ripe. The full body and firm tannins create a thick texture. This rich wine begs for aged cheese or a chocolate dessert for accompaniment. It's made with 50% Syrah and 25% each of Petite Sirah and Zinfandel.
Italy,89,50,Red Blend,red,Cirulli 2010 Ginepreta Red (Umbria),"Here's a blend of 85% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon that offers succulent plum, black currant and prune flavors layered with notes of oak, spice and cocoa. While rich fruit and smooth tannins make this appealing now, fresh acidity gives this some staying power. Drink through 2020."
US,89,36,Zinfandel,red,Stephen Ross 2015 Dante Dusi Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Soft yet perky strawberry aromas meet licorice, fennel bulb and cinnamon on the nose of this well balanced Zinfandel from a historic vineyard. There is a strong garrigue edge to the palate and a touch of roasted meat, giving depth to the bright and candied red fruit. Great with barbecue."
Italy,86,25,Pinot Grigio,white,Livio Felluga 2014 Pinot Grigio (Collio),This opens with hushed aromas that recall pressed white flower and orchard fruit. The rather lean palate shows raw yellow peach and a touch of acacia honey alongside bracing acidity. A note of bitter almond and a hint of mineral mark the finish.
US,91,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Januik 2012 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"There's plenty of nuance on this wine's aromas and flavors of café au lait, herb, dark cherry, plum and barrel spice. The balance is pitch-perfect with a light grip of tannins that need some time in the cellar to soften."
US,87,18,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Pontin del Roza 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),"Nice black cherry fruit powers the nose, with just the barest hints of stem and root. Firm fruit is buttressed by tart acids, and the middle opens up sweetly, adding flavors of cocoa and coffee. —P.G."
US,87,25,Zinfandel,red,ZinPhomaniac 2014 Old Vines Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"There's 3% each of Grenache and Petite Sirah in this wine that is quite ripe and straightforward in its fruity waves of blackberry, cherry and oaky chocolate. Firm tannins don't overwhelm, opting instead to support and structure. Black pepper leaves a lasting impression on the finish."
US,91,35,Chardonnay,white,Kessler-Haak 2014 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Chalky notes of baking soda meet with a nice sizzle of scratched lemon skin, slight bubble gum, fresh sourdough bread and pear blossom on the slightly yeasty nose. Tight lime skins, Asian pear flesh and pink grapefruit cling to a center line of texture and acidity."
US,83,32,Syrah,red,Anaba 2009 Las Madres Vineyard Syrah (Carneros),"Lots of sweet, ripe cherries in this Syrah, which also shows classic, cool-climate aromas of black pepper. A disagreeable note of crushed cigarette butts is a big minus."
US,88,22,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Cinnabar 2010 Mercury Rising Red (California),"This Cabernet-based blend is what the French call à point: right on target. It's soft and generous in cherry, mocha, plum and cedar flavors, leading to a sweet, spicy finish. Drink now."
US,86,25,Red Blend,red,Schulz 2007 Samuel's Cuveé Red (Napa Valley),"Brawny, bone dry and peppery, a big, full-bodied blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon that needs decanting or aging to make it drinkable. Hard tannins overwhelm the blackberries, mulberries and cedar. Try late 2010."
US,90,85,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Carter 2008 Revilo Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"Very ripe and forward in fruit, this Cabernet floods the mouth with cherry fruit flavors, liberally enhanced with the sweet vanilla and toast of oak barrel aging. The tannins are strong but finely ground. Appeals now for sheer beauty."
US,90,52,Pinot Noir,red,Enkidu 2014 Tina Marie Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This small-production, vineyard-designate is impressive in dried cherry and raspberry layers of flavor, supported by integrated oak. Juicy and explosive on the palate, it offers a spicy forest-floor note that complements the fruit."
France,88,14,Riesling,white,Domaine Jean Sipp 2012 Vieilles Vignes Riesling (Alsace),"With good concentration, this still-young Riesling has potential. It's aromatic, with hedgerow aromas, summer fruits and bright acidity. There is a juicy background along with a more textured character that is ready for that aging. Drink from 2016."
France,84,12,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Terre Blanque 2011  Bordeaux,"Going more for stalky tannins, this is a youthful, but also austere wine. It has perfumed wood along with hints of black currant tightly encased in a severe outer shell."
US,86,48,Pinot Noir,red,Buena Vista 2013 Bela's Selection Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A weight of oak and tannin marks this full-blown, bombastic expression of the variety. It has a reduced quality to the fruit and an unexpected twist of mint."
Italy,88,24,Sangiovese,red,San Felice 2012 Villa La Pagliaia Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Aromas of ripe berry, sunbaked soil and a hint of game lead the nose. The straightforward palate offers dried black cherry, clove and a hint of tobacco alongside supple tannins. It's already accessible so enjoy soon."
US,88,30,Chardonnay,white,J Vineyards & Winery 2015 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Honeyed, caramelized oak aromas provide a seductive entry and echo the wine's dark golden color. Baked apple, apple skin and spicy nutmeg notes add to its weighted loveliness."
Italy,85,14,Pinot Grigio,white,Borgo Magredo 2007 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Grave),"A luminous and well-executed Grigio with aromas of stone fruit and citrus, this refreshing wine would make an excellent companion to spicy Indian food. It's watery and lean in the mouth with palate-cleaning freshness."
US,91,38,Chardonnay,white,Omero 2012 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Ripe flavors suggest vanilla banana custard, along with sweet apple and smooth caramel. Some time spent in French oak brings up a finish with highlights of toasted nuts."
Italy,88,65,Red Blend,red,Castello di Bossi 2010 Corbaia Red (Toscana),"This blend of barrique-aged Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon has a fragrance of oak and bell pepper. The palate shows red currant, cherry, oak, coffee and chocolate notes. Although it has generous fruit, it lacks complexity and is shy on freshness and vitality."
Italy,87,30,White Blend,white,Fattoria Coroncino 2013 Gaiospino  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore),"This unusual, deeply golden colored wine doesn't have a very expressive nose but the round, full-bodied palate offers candied lemon drop and white peach. An almond note closes the finish."
US,92,40,Pinot Noir,red,Orfila 2013 Element 119 Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Winemaker Justin Mund worked at Laetitia for four years, so he knows the blocks, and picks this one well. The nose shows blackberry fruit but the unique parts are the beef blood and gamy pork aromas. It's sanguine on the palate at first, then opens to Bing cherries and eucalyptus oil."
US,80,11,Merlot,red,Snapping Turtle 2011 Merlot (California),"This smells and tastes like raspberry bubblegum, with a taste of white sugar."
Italy,89,30,Red Blend,red,Tenuta di Trecciano 2012 Daniello Red (Toscana),"This blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Sangiovese opens with aromas of crushed blackberry, ripe plum and blue flowers. On the palate, notes of anise and black pepper accent the core of fleshy black cherry while assertive but polished tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2016–2019."
France,86,10,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Vignobles Bonhur 2015 Château Merlet  (Bordeaux Blanc),This Bonhur family wine is perfumed although it seems to lack definition. The fruit is still coming through—this wine has the potential for crisp apples and citrus flavors as it develops. Wait until late 2016.
US,84,44,Pinot Noir,red,Vista Hills 2014 Rollins Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Disappointing. This is a tart disjointed wine, with little fruit showing. The acids are sour and have an off-putting tang. It doesn't come together. Two bottles were tasted."
US,92,39,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Baer 2012 Ursa Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc (40% each) with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this Stillwater Creek Vineyard wine has aromas of graphite, fresh herbs, dark coffee and cherry. It has palate-coating, layered chocolate and cherry flavors plus abundant vanilla accents, coalescing on the finish and lingering."
US,85,30,Merlot,red,Darcie Kent Vineyards 2007 Picazo Vineyard Merlot (Livermore Valley),"Too sharp and aggressive in tart acidity, which emphasizes the tannins, making it feel overly astringent. Not a bad wine, with pleasant cherry and blackberry flavors, but it sure is tough in the mouth."
US,88,11,Chardonnay,white,Ryan Patrick 2009 Naked Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Stainless steel fermented and aged Chardonnay (eg ‘naked') is becoming commonplace, but few offer as much snap and juicy fruitiness as this one. It's a great, round mouthful of grape juice, crisp green apple and suggestions of pineapple and citrus. A little fresh herb rounds out the finish."
US,87,50,Red Blend,red,Anemoi 2011 Notus Red (Grand Valley),"Quiet notes of smoked meat, flowers and toast lead on the nose of this blend of 60% Petit Verdot and 40% Syrah. Traces of mint and blackberry fill in the backdrop. This has a lush, alluring mouthfeel, but the midpalate needs a few years to gain weight."
France,88,17,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Cheval Quancard 2014 Monfort Bellevue  (Médoc),"There are strong elements of the wood aging in this structured wine. That gives it a dry character that still dominates the red fruits. It needs to develop. While it will always have a dry character, look for the fruit to shine with its berry flavors and acidity. Wait to drink until 2018."
Italy,85,6,Sangiovese,red,Piccini 2004 Tegole Sangiovese (Toscana),"Here's a thin, lean and easy-to-drink Sangiovese with a pretty aromatic ensemble of spice, blueberry and roasted nut."
US,89,40,Pinot Noir,red,Erath 2005 Prince Hill Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This is a thin, hard and tight version of the estate wine. It shows a bit more depth, but it's compact and slow to unravel. The oak is delivering butterscotch and vanilla, laid on as a buttery finish. This is too young to drink right now."
US,90,26,Syrah,red,Hawkins Cellars 2010 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The fruit is sourced from Kiona Vineyards on Red Mountain, some of the best Syrah in Washington. Sappy and concentrated, with a juicy and pure raspberry flavor, this shows good length and a lick of mineral on the finish."
US,85,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Armida 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Sweetness marks and compromises this Sauvignon Blanc. It has very ripe flavors of honey and pineapple and lemon jam, with brisk acidity that helps make the finish clean and bright."
France,88,14,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Château Bertinerie 2013 Grande Cuvée  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"Totally herbaceous and crisp, this is a rich, citrus-flavored wine. Grapefruit flavors dominate with a twist of lemon on top, giving a zesty texture that shows a young wine. For it to calm down and broaden out, wait until the end of 2015."
US,90,36,Zinfandel,red,Peachy Canyon 2005 Mustang Springs Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"An interesting Zin that attracts for its range of sweet fruit and dried herb flavors. The cherries, blackberries and raspberries have complex interweavings of thyme and lavender, leaving the palate to discover new sensations with every sip. Finishes dry and smoothly tannic."
US,93,150,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Kenefick Ranch 2012 Founder's Reserve Estate Grown Red (Calistoga),"This combines nearly proportional percentages of all five Bordeaux varieties, grown on the founder's estate, allowing each room to speak. The Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot together make up the majority, paving the road to full-bodied ripeness with supportive acidity, the highlights being smoky plum, blackberry and mocha."
US,90,50,Pinot Noir,red,Kazmer & Blaise 2010 Primo's Hill Pinot Noir (Carneros),"As this is tight and currently aloof, it lacks the generosity of the 2009 vintage, but it may prove to be more ageable. It has deep, earthy flavors of red currant, cola and balsam, and it could blossom into something even more complex after 2016."
France,92,30,Pinot Gris,white,Dopff & Irion 2010 Vorbourg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Hay flowers and juicy yellow pear create an enticing nose and promise rich ripeness. The palate brims with wonderfully ripe pear fruit, countered by citric freshness that brightens and heightens the flavors. The mouthfeel is rich but defined. It is the wonderful streak of freshness that holds all of this rich fruitiness together. The finish is dry and refreshing."
Italy,91,24,Red Blend,red,Renieri 2007 Re di Renieri Red (Toscana),"Re di Renieri represents a blend of four international grape varieties (including 60% Merlot) that is characterized by layers of soft chocolate and cherry. It shows a rich, plush texture on the finish."
US,85,20,Pinot Grigio,white,Belhurst 2011 Pinot Grigio (New York),"Prominent on the nose with scents of apple and pear, this is a dry, medium-bodied Pinot Grigio with subtle nectarine and citrus flavor. It's puckery from acidity, but refreshing with a clean, brisk finish."
US,89,25,Zinfandel,red,Paul Dolan 2012 Zinfandel (Mendocino County),"Balanced for dinner-time drinking, this lively and concentrated wine has fresh fruit flavors, moderate tannins and good acidity. Raspberry and blackberry notes blend with hints of smoke and black pepper to keep it interesting on the lingering finish."
US,89,69,Pinot Noir,red,Williams Selyem 2011 Westside Road Neighbors Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A little spare in concentration, yet elegantly constructed, with vibrant acidity and some firm tannins framing pomegranate, sour-cherry candy, mushroom, baking spice and toast flavors."
Italy,92,58,Red Blend,red,Cecchi 2006 Coevo Red (Toscana),"This first vintage of Coevo (a super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot) represents a new and dynamic project for Tuscany's historic Cecchi estate. The wine is rich, opulent and redolent of all kinds of dark fruit and spice."
France,87,16,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château de Ricaud 2012  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux,"This Vignobles Dourthe wine is ripe and richly textured. Full and blackberry flavored, it is 84% Merlot, 11% Cabernet Sauvignon, 3% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot. An attractive interplay between the fruit and the tannins gives a balanced wine. Drink from 2017."
France,87,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château la Rose Bellevue 2006 Prestige  (Premieres Côtes de Blaye),"Smooth, rounded, with an obvious layer of wood to soften the red fruits and dry tannins. This is a balanced wine, offering some good juicy fruits and a bright red berry finish."
US,87,12,Syrah,red,Esser 2014 Rosé of Syrah (Monterey County),"Boasting one of the prettiest hot pink-meets-purple colors imaginable in wine, this offers aromas of freeze-dried strawberries, ripe raspberry and a bitter tinge of pink grapefruit and cranberry. The flavors reflect those aromas exactly, particularly the raspberry fruit."
US,95,200,Red Blend,red,Joseph Phelps 2005 Insignia Red (Napa Valley),"This is not a wine for tonight, or next year, or for at least the next six years. It's shut down in tannins, with an astringency that can't be overcome even with decanting, although that won't stop people from opening it before its time. Buried beneath the tannins are well-developed black currant, roasted meat and cedar flavors that define upscale Napa Cab. Really fine and distinguished, a wine to cellar and enjoy for many years."
US,88,25,Chardonnay,white,Friedeman 2013 Dichotomy Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This is a rocking price for the quality of the wine, a small-production crafting of well-grown grapes in a great year. Light on the oak imprint, it shines instead in sweet and sour stone fruit, most vibrantly apricot, with a soft and layered silkiness to the texture."
US,85,42,Pinot Noir,red,Storrs 2007 Christie Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"The fruit is extracted and sweet in this scoury wine. It floods the mouth with raspberry and cherry jam, with plenty of toasty oak. The texture is irregular, though, with some harsh tannins."
US,92,75,Pinot Noir,red,WillaKenzie Estate 2014 Terres Basses Pinot Noir,"Dark and fruity, this juicy wine is packed with black cherry and highlighted with tobacco and coffee. The tannins are substantial, and hint at clean earth. It's big and full through the middle, but tails off a bit in the finish."
US,88,18,Merlot,red,Eight Bells 2009 Roosevelt Red Merlot (Yakima Valley),"This has pretty fruit flavors of plums and spicy black cherries. At first the wine seems sharp and slightly warm, but it mellows with air."
US,87,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Angeline 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"The mint-green bottle color presages the minty flavors of this dry, crisp wine. The fruit feels delicately balanced between underripe and fine, with suggestions of white peach and mango. It shows some real complexity, and the all-important acidity is wonderful."
Italy,86,15,White Blend,white,Gianni Tessari 2016  Soave,"Aromas of white spring flower and yellow stone fruit lead the nose on this bright straightforward white. It's simple but well made, with flavors of yellow peach and a hint of dried herb alongside crisp acidity."
US,87,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Arger-Martucci 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A shade off the 2005, being leaner and more tannic, and more akin to the 2001. It's a dry, taut Cab, marked by a drying astringency accompanying the blackberry and mineral flavors. Drink now–2012."
US,88,45,Merlot,red,Martin Ray 2009 Merlot (Diamond Mountain District),"A robust Merlot for drinking now, this has ripe cherry and chocolate flavors, with a rich veneer of smoky oak. The notoriously hard Diamond Mountain tannins have been wrestled into submission."
US,86,19,Pinot Noir,red,Sostener 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Simple but classy aromas of red currant and raspberries show on the nose of this bottling from an all-star team of the appellation. The palate is light and easy, with tart cranberry and a large boost of tannic grip, a surprise for how light it feels."
US,89,55,Syrah,red,Cowhorn 2011 Sentience Syrah (Applegate Valley),"Tart and tannic, this has a sleek, almost steely character, with cranberry and black cherry fruit, razor's edge tannins, and supporting acidity."
France,87,65,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Bellerose Figeac 2007 Prestige  (Saint-Émilion),"A wine that shows firm tannins, fruit and wood acidity. It is now ready to drink, a wine that will remain firm and dry."
US,85,16,Red Blend,red,Abacela NV Vintner's Blend #10 Red Table Wine Red (Southern Oregon),"A tart, all-purpose red, with 14 different grapes in the blend. The result, predictably, is generic. No particular variety dominates; it's a high acid red wine, with stiff tannins."
US,87,35,Zinfandel,red,Benessere 2014 Estate Black Glass Vineyard Zinfandel (St. Helena),"Cherry, berry and smoke ride atop a sultry texture in this estate wine, 100% varietal. Leathery accents provide texture and additional weight as a buildup to a seamless, easygoing finish rides out."
US,94,48,Syrah,red,Rôtie Cellars 2014 Northern Blend Syrah (Washington),"Cofermented with 5% Viognier, this perfumed wine brings aromas of green olive, stems, potpourri, blue fruit and moist earth. The palate is chock-full of layered boysenberry and earth flavors, earthshaking in their intensity, with a mouthfeel that only heightens the interest."
US,94,50,Chardonnay,white,Trombetta 2014 Gap's Crown Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"This is a gorgeous rendering of grape and place. Steely at first, it shows off the coolness of the site, yet it's thick and inviting in apple skin, lemon bar and fresh-picked papaya. Minerality-driven, it never taxes the palate, instead releasing quiet waves of flavor and acidity."
US,90,65,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Davis Family 2013 Cab 5 Rockpile Ridge Red (Rockpile),"From an appellation better known for Zin, this blend of 41% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Cabernet Franc, 21% Malbec, 8% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot works well—a study in chocolate-covered blackberry and blueberry with a powerful firmness balanced by moderate acidity."
US,84,27,Zinfandel,red,Dante Robere 2010 Zinfandel (San Francisco Bay),"This new Zin from Livermore Valley-based Dante Robere is from two vineyards, one in Livermore and the other in Brentwood. The fruit is mostly plum, with a trace of wintergreen on the mid-palate but even for Zin the fruit flavors are masked somewhat by the high alcohol; it's for those who like a heavy-hitting wine."
US,87,30,Pinot Noir,red,Bernardus 2009 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Deliciously rich and extracted in jammy raspberry, cherry and cola fruit, with lots of sweet oak adding vanilla and buttered toast. Could use greater depth, though, as it's a little one-dimensional. Drink now."
US,88,15,Riesling,white,Thirsty Owl Wine Company 2014 Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Piercing lime notes hit a staccato beat against ripe, luscious white grapefruit in this spry, zesty Riesling. A shade off dry, it's vibrant yet satisfyingly easy drinking. Enjoy now for its youthful exuberance."
US,93,39,Chardonnay,white,Testarossa 2006 La Cruz Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"A worthy followup to the '05, possibly even richer and more balanced. Shows wonderfully crisp, mouthwatering acidity framing fruit that's so pure, it's like the essence of pineapples, mangoes, limes and green apples. Lots of oak is here, too, and the smoky, spicy vanillins add just the right touch."
France,83,6,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Le Pépin 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France),"Mouthwatering acidity combines with a sweet aftertaste to give a wine that could be unbalanced but, surprisingly, has an attractive soft texture and easygoing fruitiness. Drink immediately."
US,88,26,Pinot Gris,white,Balo 2014 Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley),"Honeylike aromas, ripe peach and apple flavors and rather full body give this wine good depth and breadth. It seems like just the thing for a picnic or to serve with cheese at a party."
US,90,35,Chardonnay,white,Lincourt 2013 Zoula Nunn Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),The freshness of seared Meyer lemon and squeezed lime peel meets with the warmth of vanilla and pineapple in the nose of this solid bottling. The palate offers white peach and smoked apples laid across a very tense and pithy texture. It finishes on a Juicy Fruit bubblegum element that's intriguing and not overdone.
Italy,90,30,Sangiovese,red,Ridolfi 2015  Rosso di Montalcino,"Juicy and round, youthful red delivers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and clove aromas and flavors. Chewy tannins provide structure. Enjoy through 2020."
US,95,52,Pinot Noir,red,Roar 2014 Sierra Mar Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"A stunning bottling from the Franscioni family, this shows exotic cinnamon, crystallized black-cherry juice, fresh black raspberry and graphite on the extremely elegant, soft and inviting nose. There's a tension between ripe black raspberry and everything else on the palate, from fennel and black pepper to black slate minerality. It's a seamless wine."
US,89,24,Pinot Noir,red,Kendall-Jackson 2012 Vintner's Reserve Pinot Noir (California),"The winery has sourced this wine from their coastal vineyards, which accounts for its acidity and long hangtime raspberry, persimmon and sour-cherry candy flavors. With a silky texture, it's lovely to drink now."
US,90,50,Chardonnay,white,Liquid Farm 2010 Golden Slope Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Polished and creamy, this is made to appeal to the popular style. It's rich and ripe in tangerine, apricot and lime fruit, with toasty, vanilla overtones. Brightened by crisp acidity, it's a lovely wine to drink now."
US,90,13,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Barrel Ranch 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"This selection is from Terravant Wine Company, a custom-crush facility in Santa Barbara County. Dry and tannic, it shows classic Cabernet Sauvignon character. It has a smoothness often associated with Napa Valley wines and flavors of blackberry, black currant and oak."
US,84,16,Chardonnay,white,Carmel Road 2012 Liberated Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),"This Chardonnay, as you may have guessed from the designation, is unoaked. What you get is fruit, and plenty of it, in the form of pineapples and peaches. There's a good burst of acidity on the finish."
France,88,14,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Lagrange Monbadon 2014  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"When vineyards or, at least, land is in the family since the 15th century, it is interesting to taste their wines trending back to “bio.” This Baron de Montfort vineyard is certified organic. The result is fresh while also ripe, this is a lightly wood-tinted wine. It has a dry edge along with blackberry fruits and firm tannins. The acidity at the end acts as a counter-balance. Drink from 2019."
US,93,45,Syrah,red,Think Tank 2007 White Hawk Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"A gorgeous Syrah, sumptuous and seductive, with a texture of sheer silk and satin. Beyond that, the flavors are rich and complex, offering satisfying waves of blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, cassis, milk chocolate, anise, pepper and toast. Really fine, with a good backbone of tannins. Now–2011."
France,93,49,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château la Gaffelière 2014 Dame Gaffelière  (Saint-Émilion),"The second wine of this Saint-Emilion Premier Grand Cru Classé estate comes from selected parcels. Rich and with the smoothness of oak aging and ripe grapes, it is a generous wine that is developing well. Drink from 2020."
France,93,20,Riesling,white,Domaine Jean Sipp 2013 Vieilles Vignes Riesling (Alsace),"Hints of dried pear and apple appear on the nose and suggest subtlety but the palate does otherwise: it comes in with bright citrus freshness, recalling lemon oil and candied lemon peel. This is absolutely dry and very sprightly, lively and even exuberant. There is great depth of fruit here that will just evolve. Drink 2017—2030."
US,89,58,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Darby 2010 The Swagger Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot-dominant blend has reserved aromas of herbs, cherry and freshly cut grass. The coffee and dark fruit flavors are full bodied, with a polished feel."
France,88,23,Riesling,white,Vieil Armand 2014 Tradition Riesling (Alsace),"Lemony freshness meets earthy, textured glints on this slender Riesling characterized by its brightness and slender body. Underneath it all, plenty of tart, refreshing apple fruit leads to a clean, lively finish."
US,89,35,Chardonnay,white,Demetria 2012 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"This is a successful straight-ahead Chardonnay, with aromas of buttercream, vanilla and orange cake developing complexity thanks to alkaline, pithy notes. For such a rich nose, it proves quite clean and crisp on the palate, with lemon-lime soda, wet slate and just a touch of buttered apples."
France,88,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Bibian 2013  Haut-Médoc,"This wine is dry, full of tannins that mask the fruit and give the wine an austere character that will need time to soften out. The aftertaste contines the dry theme, but with hints of a more fruity future. Drink from 2018 when the fruit will have asserted itself."
France,88,22,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Fournier Père et Fils 2010 Côtes de Morogues  (Menetou-Salon),"One of the small Sauvignon Blanc areas close to Sancerre, Menetou-Salon produces a light, crisp and herbal style of wine. This fits that bill well, its freshness contained within the flavors of hedgerow fruits and tangy acids."
Italy,91,17,Red Blend,red,Barone di Villagrande 2008 Sciara Red (Sicilia),"Merlot and Nerello Mascalese make for perfect blending partners, creating a wine with cherry softness and bright fruit intensity, plus volcanic minerality and elegance. Polished and clean on the finish."
US,85,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Styring 2010 Shameless Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (OR)),"This high-toned bruiser pushes ultraripe scents of figs and raisins and prunes to the front, yet shows a green streak in the tannins. The wine spent 34 months in barrel, which adds more heavy-duty accents but does not mask the underlying stemminess."
US,93,125,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Flora Springs 2012 Hillside Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"An estate wine from an elevated elevation, this opens in fragrant red cherry and vanilla, with a subtle trace of brambly blackberry. Soft, it features a supple mouthfeel, medium weight and a backbone of structure, earthy and enticing. Easily enjoyable now, it should take on added complexity through 2022."
US,83,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Lava Cap 2010 Stromberg Cabernet Sauvignon (El Dorado),"Serviceable and soft, this Stromberg Cab could use a bit more heft to liven its fruit."
US,82,22,Pinot Noir,red,Carmel Road 2012 Pinot Noir (Monterey),"This Pinot is dry, silky and simple, with cherry pie flavors. There's a vegetal, green streak that's disagreeable."
France,89,30,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Joseph Mellot 2014 Domaine des Mariniers  (Pouilly-Fumé),"Commemorating the small boats that once plied the Loire river, this wine is fresh with a ripe yellow-fruit character that contrasts with the salty, tangy flavors to give the wine its texture and tight, steely structure. The wine will be best kept for a few months; drink from 2017."
US,90,36,Zinfandel,red,Artezin 2014 Collins Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"From old-vine blocks planted in 1934, this vineyard-designate also contains 4% Carignane. Full bodied and richly concentrated, it has pillowy tannins, and aromas and flavors defined by mint, dill, black licorice and leather. Layers of deep, dark blackberry and black cherry give it a pleasing fruitiness as well."
France,89,28,Sauvignon Blanc,white,François Millet 2012 Empreinte Blanc  (Sancerre),"Cool and crisp, this tightly herbaceous wine has a concentrated, juicy, green fruit character along with a tangy texture. The fruits are complemented by the tight, acidic aftertaste. Drink from 2014."
France,90,33,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Haut Bages Libéral 2013  Pauillac,"This is a structured wine, packed with black-currant fruits and fresh acidity. It is already becoming balanced with the finely drawn structure in balance with the perfumed fruits. Drink from 2018."
France,88,40,Pinot Noir,red,Antonin Rodet 2007 Les Molesmes Château de Rully Premier Cru  (Rully),"An intensely wooded wine that is dominated by dark tannins. The red berry fruit is buried under the dry spice and toast character, although at the end there is a more juicy element."
France,92,56,Pinot Noir,red,Louis Jadot 2009  Vosne-Romanée,"Very structured, as befits a Vosne-Romanée, even a village wine. The black cherry fruit and layered acidity are combined with a firm and dry tannic core. There is power here, and some aging potential."
Italy,97,140,Sangiovese,red,Ciacci Piccolomini d'Aragona 2010 Vigna di Pianrosso Santa Caterina d'Oro Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Aromas of wild berry, forest floor, new leather, grilled herb, menthol and dark spice all come together on this full-bodied red. The structured palate is still young but shows great depth, offering mature black cherry, tobacco, clove and licorice framed in youthfully assertive tannins that give it an age-worthy structure. Drink 2022–2040."
Italy,95,30,Red Blend,red,Biondi 2014 Contrada Monte San Nicolò  (Etna),"Fragrant and loaded with finesse, this opens with aromas of wild berry, blue flower, new leather, aromatic herb and a whiff of exotic spice. The structured, elegant palate delivers layers of red cherry, strawberry, flinty mineral, orange zest, star anise and clove framed in firm, polished tannins and bright acidity. It's still young and will develop even more complexity. Drink 2019–2029."
US,94,55,Syrah,red,Jada Vineyard & Winery 2014 Jersey Girl Syrah (Paso Robles Willow Creek District),"Elegant aromas of gingerbread spice, baked blueberry, blackberry and vanilla show on the nose of this layered bottling. Flavors are well integrated and presented atop a soft but noticeable structure, thick with lavender, beef, black currant and allspice on the finish."
US,85,19,Chardonnay,white,Vina Robles 2012 Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"The winery turns to this Monterey appellation to up their Chardonnay games. The wine is lush and oaky, with intensely ripe tangerine and apricot flavors."
US,88,48,Pinot Noir,red,Nicholson Ranch 2012 Estate Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This light, bright and juicy wine from estate vineyards exalts in the goodness of red cherry and cola spice. Not fussy, the wine has medium body and acidity. It finishes clean and restrained on the palate, making for an easygoing quaff."
France,87,37,Chardonnay,white,Pierre Morey 2007 Bourgogne Chardonnay  (Bourgogne),"A soft, firm wine with a nice touch of citrus. The character is fresh, light, with a fine burst of final acidity to mark an easy, bright wine."
US,87,26,Pinot Noir,red,Spindrift Cellars 2013 OSU Woodhall III Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Tart cran-apple fruit—some of it from 35-year-old vines—is at the heart of this vineyard-designated cuvée. It has a woody/earthy undertone, tart acids and some stiffening tannins."
Italy,88,28,Red Blend,red,Banfi 2013 Bel Nero Red (Toscana),"Made predominantly with Sangiovese and small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this offers pretty aromas of blue flower, red berry, menthol and dark spice. The bright straightforward palate offers dried red cherry, clove and a hint of espresso alongside lithe tannins."
France,90,45,Red Blend,red,Domaine Torraccia 2013 Oriu Réserve de Torraccia Red (Corse Porto Vecchio),"Despite its light color, this is a wine for aging. Even now, the tannins are firm and give a dry texture to its red berry fruit. With acidity as well as structure, it's built for powerful meat dishes. Drink from 2018, when the tannins will have softened further."
Italy,86,17,Sangiovese,red,Podere dal Nespoli 2015 Prugneto Sangiovese (Romagna),This densely hued wine has aromas of black plum and vanilla that carry over to the simple palate along with a touch of cedar. Pliant tannins give it an easygoing nature. Drink soon.
France,88,75,Chardonnay,white,Louis Latour 2009 Charmes  (Meursault),"Open and charming as its name suggests, the wine is ripe and soft. The acidity is somewhat lost in the sweet, almost tropical fruit."
US,88,9,Chardonnay,white,Corvidae 2008 Mirth Chardonnay (Washington-Oregon),"This brings a boatload of flavor for the price. It's packed with fruit;  citrus, pineapple, apple, and peach, round and succulent, with just the right amount of sharp acidity to give it some verve."
US,81,9,White Blend,white,Kenwood 2011 Vintage White White (Sonoma County),It's hard to fall in love with this blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay. It has unripe green flavors that border on ammonia.
US,88,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Alta Maria 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara County),"Fresh as a daisy, with green grass, lemon, lime and peach flavors that taste like they were just picked under the summer sun. Juicy acidity gets the mouth watering. The alcohol is modest, giving the wine a light delicacy."
US,89,36,Chardonnay,white,Patz & Hall 2005 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Dry and crisp and with some complexity. The oak is 50% new and very evident in the smoky caramel, while the fruit veers toward peaches and pineapples. As is often the case with Napa Chard, there's a sweet, herbal quality. Drink now through 2009."
Italy,87,19,Red Blend,red,Monterotondo 2012 Vaggiolata  (Chianti Classico),"Dark berry, truffle, toast and kitchen spice aromas meld in the glass. On the palate, notes of roasted coffee bean, powdered sage and ground pepper accent a core of dried black cherry while assertive tannins provide the framework. It ends on an astringent note."
US,86,20,Pinot Noir,red,Duck Pond 2012 Fries Family Cellars Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Primary fruit flavors of cranberry are at the core here, with medium concentration and acidity. Flavors of leaf and stem come into play and turn the finish slightly bitter. Give this until 2015."
US,92,45,Pinot Noir,red,Résonance 2015 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Maison Louis Jadot's Willamette Valley project continues to bear fruit and has increased the production of this entry-level cuvée. A lovely, chunky mix of purple and black fruit, it's beautifully proportioned, with plenty of power, lacking only the depth of the older estate vines. It finishes on a lacy note of minerality."
US,82,16,Pinot Noir,red,Esser Cellars 2006 Pinot Noir (California),"Kind of Pinot Noir-like, with a silky texture, crisp acids and cherry and spice flavors. But it's rustic and simple, with a soft, gluey mouthfeel."
US,87,18,Zinfandel,red,Truett Hurst 2013 Salmon Run Rosé Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Meaty, dry and balanced yet big, this is a substantial mouthful of Rosé. Made from Dry Creek Zinfandel with 12% Syrah, it's brooding in dark berry and peach fruit and can be paired much as a full-bodied red wine would be."
US,89,22,Riesling,white,MaidenStoen 2014 Coast View Vineyard Riesling (Monterey County),"A straightforward, modern dry Riesling, this wine shows a slight hint of gasoline, citrus blossoms, wet river stones and apple skin on the nose. The mouthfeel is more full than Mike Callahan's other bottlings, with waxy citrus skins, lime pith, sour apple, alkaline elements and a touch of white jasmine."
US,85,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Chiarello Family Vineyards 2010 Bambino Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"Tastes surprisingly ripe—even overripe—with dark chocolate, prune and caramelized oak flavors. Yet the tannin-acid structure is pure Napa—fine and elegant."
US,90,105,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Bennett Lane 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Tannic and robust, this reserve-tier wine offers smoothly chiseled tannin and full-bodied flavors like brick, black cherry, leather and clove. It begs to be paired with hearty meat dishes."
US,90,40,Syrah,red,North by Northwest 2009 Les Collines Block 12 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Sourced entirely from Walla Walla's Les Collines Vineyard, this lovely Syrah features pretty strawberry and cherry flavors that are broadly displayed with a rich vein of chocolate. It's forward and flavorful, drinking quite nicely already, but with the stuffing to cellar for a few more years."
France,88,13,Chardonnay,white,Les Costières de Pomerols 2016 Le Jade Chardonnay (Pays d'Oc),"Medium-intense notes of golden apple skin, lime peel and wild yellow flowers are graced by a hint of gingery spice. The medium-weight palate is slightly round and creamy, but not overly so, with a generous wood-grilled-apple flavor that lingers on the toasty finish."
France,91,57,Syrah,red,Maison Nicolas Perrin 2011  Cornas,"The 2011s from Cornas show high levels of ripeness, and this négociant wine is no exception. It's almost pruny, with other notes of meat, clove and cinnamon, yet remains crisp and firm, picking up hints of black olive and espresso on the finish. Drink now–2025."
US,84,32,Pinot Noir,red,TreViti 2006 Stolo Family Vineyard Anno di Isabella Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"Dry and silky but heavy, with earthy flavors of herbs, mushrooms, cherries, cola and spice. Drink now."
US,82,18,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Dominican Oaks 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Tough and gritty, this is an everyday Cabernet. It's full-bodied and dry, with some green flavors."
France,86,21,Chardonnay,white,Domaine du Chalet Pouilly 2011  Saint-Véran,"A simple, rounded wine, soft and fruity. Pear and apricot flavors dominate along with a crisper, grapefruit edge. The wine is aging quickly, and will be ready in a few months."
Italy,88,20,Red Blend,red,Tenuta Cappellina 2012  Chianti Classico,"A blend of Sangiovese, Canaiolo and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas suggesting mature dark-skinned fruit, toast, sunbaked earth and cooking spice. On the polished, straightforward palate, hints of clove, orange peel and anise back up a core of dried black cherry while close-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2018."
France,88,41,Pinot Noir,red,Louis Max 2009 Domaine de la Créa Les Cent Vignes Premier Cru  (Beaune),"Raspberry ripeness and soft tannins lend warmth to this structured wine. It has weight and a smoky wood character, with a juicy finish. Age for 2–3 years."
France,87,37,Chardonnay,white,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2013 Réserve Personnelle  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"Tangy and mineral, this is a crisp apple- and citrus-driven wine, full of fruitiness while also having a tight texture. Its acidity just adds to the generally ripe character of the wine. Drink now."
US,88,20,Merlot,red,Lovingston 2010 Josie's Knoll Merlot (Monticello),"Ripe and fruit forward, this boasts aromas of blackberry jam, boysenberry, spice and pastry crust. The palate is lush and creamy, with a soft core that's framed by accessible tannins. It's a bit warm on the finish, but the flavors of berry and cedar linger."
US,94,36,Chardonnay,white,Abeja 2009 Chardonnay (Washington),"Fresh and firm, with juicy primary fruits that meld together flavors of tropical and stone fruits—a riot of papaya, peach, pineapple, candied lemon and more. The butterscotch barrel notes glide into the mid-palate and coat the back of the throat, resonating long after the wine is swallowed. Based on previous vintages, this is a surefire six to eight year wine for cellaring."
US,91,43,Pinot Noir,red,MacMurray Estate Vineyards 2015 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a juicy, earthy and expansive wine, with highlights of rose petal and wild strawberry. Pretty and ethereal, it offers body without an abundance of weight, the oak and tannin both integrated well."
France,86,13,Chardonnay,white,Bougrier 2015 Alain de la Treille Chardonnay (Vin de France),"This warm wine brings out the roundness and open accessibility of warm-climate Chardonnay. With yellow fruits and clean acidity, it is attractively ready to drink."
France,86,30,Pinot Noir,red,Evening Land 2011 Château de Bligny  (Côte de Nuits-Villages),"Lightly tannic and attractively fruity, it's ready to drink. It has a soft structure, red fruits and a finish that is full of bright acidity."
US,94,55,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Divio 2014 Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"The third of the winery's 2014 Pinots to be released is the best yet. Vibrant and captivating from the first sniff to the final sip, this deftly displays lightly spicy cherry fruit, lively acidity and a supple mouthfeel. There's just the right touch of new wood and the balance throughout to age long-term. Drink now through 2030."
US,90,26,Chardonnay,white,Conarium 2013 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Rich yet plenty retentive of acidity, this coastal white is complex in tropical mango and papaya while also offering finely tuned layers of fig and honeycomb. Light enough to enjoy on its own or with delicate fare, it's an enjoyable wine made well in small quantities."
US,91,60,Pinot Noir,red,Manzoni 2011 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"A rich barrel selection, this is a fine Pinot Noir that's silky, brisk in acidity, dry and deeply flavored in raspberries, cherries and Dr. Pepper cola. Give it at least until 2018 in the cellar."
US,88,37,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Tapteil Vineyard 2010 E&E Shaw Vineyard Red (Red Mountain),"Comprised of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this single-vineyard Bordeaux-style blend displays ripe, round, flavorful fruit, along with a leafy component. The barrel aging has added butterscotch and chocolate notes to the mix. The wine stops just a bit short, but further bottle age may help to lengthen the finish."
US,90,20,Syrah,red,Zaca Mesa 2000 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"A nice mouthful of Syrah, rich and full-bodied. Drinks dry and rather tannic, with plummy, blackberry, peppery flavors. But it's very complex. If you use your imagination, you can find anise, white chocolate, bacon, and all sorts of other things. Dry, rich, and long in the finish, a distinctive wine that pushes the reputation of this valley for Syrah."
US,86,26,Pinot Noir,red,Calera 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"This Pinot is dry in style and tart with acidity, along with flavors of cranberries, cherries, sweet tobacco and oak. Gritty tannins and inconsistently ripened fruit lend this wine a common touch. It's certainly not an ager, but it is an appealing wine to drink now."
US,87,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hightower 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Sourced largely from Red Mountain fruit, this includes 18% Merlot in the blend. It's toasty and ripe, with the barrel flavors most evident in both nose and palate. The Cabernet fruit is mild and lightly peppery, berry and cranberry mostly. There is plenty of chocolate, toast, coffee and smoke as well, presumably from aging 20 months in oak."
Italy,94,63,Red Blend,red,Masi 2009 Costasera  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"From one of Amarone's premier producers, this delicious Amarone delivers generous black cherry flavors, with hints of raisin, white pepper, nutmeg and chocolate. It's soft and round, with smooth, velvety tannins and compelling intensity."
US,84,10,Red Blend,red,Insomnia 2010 Red (California),"Rustic and a little sweet tasting, this has flavors of cherry pie, red currant and toast. Drink it with cheeseburgers."
US,92,42,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Bunchgrass 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This full-bodied, 100% Cabernet is lightly gamy, offering a sensuous potpourri of wild herbs and brambly berries. It's subtle, lovely, distinctive, smoothly rendered and unusually textural and complex. Drink it with enjoyment now, or give it a few more years in the cellar."
France,86,14,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Eric Louis 2016 Alphonse Dolly Les Doigts d'Or de Dolly Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France),Ripe tropical fruit flavors give this wine from Sancerre producer Eric Louis its warm character. It has enough acidity to cut through the richness and give it a fruity aftertaste. It's ready to drink.
US,89,55,Pinot Noir,red,Aiken 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),"This is a big, rich, somewhat heavy Pinot Noir, stuffed with flavors of raspberry and cherry pie, red licorice and oak. It's impressive for its sheer volume, with zippy acidity that helps balance the high alcohol. It needs a few hours in the decanter to round off the edges, and it should hold in the bottle for several years."
Italy,90,60,Red Blend,red,Corteforte 2008 Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"Forest floor, resin, exotic spice, steeped plum and a balsamic note lead the way on this robust red. The firmly structured palate offers raisin, dried cherry, licorice and coffee framed in tightly wound, close-grained tannins."
US,87,18,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Freakshow 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"Michael David's new Cabernet Sauvignon brand has the winery's signature toasted oak and coconut-kissed tannins. But it's interestingly tamed, bearing bursts of black cherry and blackberry that effortlessly hit your palate in between quiet gusts of vanilla spice."
France,87,12,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château de l'Aubrade 2016  Bordeaux Blanc,"Crisp and taut, this Lobre family wine is on a tight rope. It balances between intense citrus acidity and riper apricot and pear favors. It will be better from late 2017."
US,88,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Ambassador Vineyard 2014 Plenipotentiary Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"Aromas of smoke, vanilla, pencil box and green herb are followed by red fruit and medicinal flavors. Floral notes persist on the finish."
US,93,60,Merlot,red,Keenan 2005 Reserve Mailbox Vineyard Merlot (Spring Mountain District),"This bottling has turned out to be one of California's more important Merlot releases. The '05, like its immediate predecessors, is a dry, richly tannic wine of great elegance and structural complexity. It pleases now for the wealth of black currants, anise, herbs, spices and smoky oak, and should develop bottle nuances through 2011."
US,85,14,Pinot Gris,white,Stolen Identity 2015 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"You'll have to look in the very lower left hand corner of the back label to spot the vintage (2015) on this bottle. It's a light simple wine, with delicate flavors of melon and pear. The finish is soft and has a residual hint of paste."
US,88,38,Chardonnay,white,Rally Point Wines 2013 Limited Production Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Dark hay in color with a concentration of oak on the nose, the palate retains that richness of nutty almond and apple pie, finding a balance that betrays the heavier implications of the initial aromas. On the finish it offers a lightness of being, as well as a touch of perfume."
US,90,40,Red Blend,red,Ray's Station Vineyards 2012 Coro Mendocino Red (Mendocino),"Ripe fruit flavors and a delicious spiciness combine to make this full-bodied but not very tannic wine easy to love. It smells like cherries and raspberries, tastes full but not sweet, and has a texture that spreads and softens on the palate like melting chocolate. It's made with 50% Zinfandel and almost equal parts Syrah, Carignane and Petite Sirah."
Italy,94,150,Red Blend,red,Jacopo Biondi-Santi 2001 Schidione Red (Toscana),"For lovers of sophisticated Italian wine, Schidione (a hearty blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese and Merlot) shows personality, elegance and impressive intensity. The mouthfeel is smooth and rich. An excellent addition to a cellar collection."
US,92,25,Pinot Noir,red,Husch 2014 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Husch is one of the original Anderson Valley wineries and has not been a particular Pinot Noir star, but this fantastic 2014 may start a trend. Fresh and alive, the wine is medium bodied but packs lots of tangy cherry and almost jammy plum flavors into a smooth but lightly tannic texture that provides great structure. Simply delicious, it's balanced well enough to enjoy time after time."
US,87,30,Pinot Noir,red,Walnut City WineWorks 2012 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Compared with the the regular bottling, this reserve has a touch more concentration to the black cherry fruit. It pays for it with some hard, rather stemmy tannins that can turn bitter. Give this some extra time to breathe after being opened."
France,85,16,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Lapinesse 2013 Les Terrasses de Colas  (Graves),"This light wine has red berry flavors and lots of acidity. With only the lightest texture, it's all about fruitiness. Drink now."
US,89,55,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,North by Northwest 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Herb, cherry, wood spice and vanilla aromas are followed by cherry and blackberry flavors backed by a squeeze of dry tannins. There are good things going on but the oak gets a bit up front."
US,87,32,Red Blend,red,Maryhill 2011 Proprietor's Reserve Tavola Rosso Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of Merlot, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is indeed a sturdy red table wine. The tannins are dense and chewy, the fruit submerged beneath barrel flavors of toast, caramel and nougat. It spent 20 months in 50% new French oak."
US,86,19,White Blend,white,Genoa 2014 Tell-Tale Super-Tuscan-Style White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of near-equal parts Pinot Grigio, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, this wine brings aromas of overripe pear and apple and toasted grapenuts that lead to dry, lightly fruit flavors. It's a straightforward quaffer."
US,86,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Decoy 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"Classically aromatic and slightly grassy, it has touches of sweet pineapple and vanilla dancing throughout the soft layers of easy-drinking acidity and crispness."
Italy,89,22,Sangiovese,red,Cantalici L'Antica Fornace di Ridolfo 2012 Baruffo  (Chianti Classico),"Aromas of menthol, underbrush, scorched soil, licorice and ripe plum lead the nose. The structured palate delivers dried black cherry, aniseed, eucalyptus and ground pepper alongside a backbone of fine-grained tannins. It closes on a coffee note."
US,92,50,Syrah,red,Jaffurs 2013 Kimsey Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"This bottling from a relatively new vineyard in Ballard Canyon shows blueberry fruit surrounded by strands of black licorice and chunks of damp pine wood on the nose. The blackberry, blueberry and crushed violet flavors lead into slight beef char and burnt wood on the palate."
US,83,28,Red Blend,red,Casa Rondeña Winery 2006 Calvin Clarion Red (New Mexico),"A plucky nose of fruitcake and spice leads off. On the palate, good, robust red fruit, a solid, dry and minerally backbone and a touch of oak offer dimension and balance. A bit rough and ready, the wine will benefit from pairing with grilled meats or spicy dishes that can match its energy."
US,88,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hawkstone 2004 Connoisseur Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"A good Cabernet for the table, with its dryness, firm tannins and general balance. Shows deep, long-lasting flavors of black currants, anise and smoky cedar, and could even develop some bottle complexity."
US,84,28,Pinot Noir,red,Jacob Williams 2012 Underwood Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"This moderately colored wine offers an unusual assortment of cherry, smoke, green wood and medicinal notes. The strawberry, cranberry and mesquite flavors are elegant, with a chalky feel."
France,94,66,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Domaine de la Janasse 2010 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"A terrific value among top-flight Châteauneufs, even Janasse's entry-level wine excels in 2010. Sexy leather and suede trappings embrace ripe cherry and chocolate notes, while the palate exudes lushness yet retains enough firmness on the finish to suggest a lifespan of at least 6–8 years."
France,87,14,Riesling,white,Pierre and Charles Sparr 2011 Cuvée Tradition Riesling (Alsace),"A very perfumed, fragrant and refreshing wine. It is full in the mouth, ripe, smelling of hedgerow blossoms and having a touch of spring in its fruits. Ready to drink, but also keep until 2016."
France,89,28,Pinot Noir,red,François Baur 2012 Sang du Dragon Pinot Noir (Alsace),"The merest hint of oak spice wafts from the nose. The palate has that softly oaked, spiced roundedness that adds cinnamon and a touch of vanilla to gentle but not overtly expressed berry notes. There is some tannic grip, too."
US,93,50,Pinot Noir,red,Loring Wine Company 2014 Rancho La Vina Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Graphite, rose petals, vanilla and a strong yet not over-exuberant black cherry quality pump up the nose of this decadent bottling by Brian Loring. There's great tactile texture once sipped, with chalky tannins unveiling ripe cranberry, red cherry, clay, cinnamon and baking-spice elements."
US,90,95,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,V. Sattui 2011 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The Preston Vineyard sits near the original site of Niebaum's original plantings for Inglenook, and also near the vineyards of Beaulieu Vineyards. Thick and rich in blackberry and espresso, this wine exudes its proximity to vigorous, big-boned sites, yet retains the elegance and herbal-cedar notes of the vintage, dusted in peppery spice."
US,94,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Lieff 2006 Auberge Road Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine was grown in the Vaca Mountains above the Silverado Trail, within the Rutherford AVA. It's very dry and very tannic, making it undrinkable now. Yet it has a potent core of blackberries and black cherries, and is classically structured. Seems to have everything it needs for the cellar. 2012–2018."
US,91,28,Pinot Gris,white,Antiquum Farm 2015 Aurosa Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"This unusual rosé is all Pinot Gris, picked for thick skins, chewy tannins, high acidity, and given a 36-hour cold soak prior to fermentation. It's a pale salmon/copper shade, full-bodied and juicy, with fruit flavors of peach and citrus. Highlights of hibiscus tea and floral aromatics contribute further complexity."
US,87,26,Riesling,white,Hermann J. Wiemer 2007 Reserve Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Lively, enticing, this wine offers aromas and flavors of apples and pears and a smack of spice. The wine's elegant balance of fruit, sugar and acid gives it a food pairing advantage—partner it with everything from fresh grilled seafood to spicy ethnic cuisine. A lingering spicy finish seals the deal."
Italy,92,40,Sangiovese,red,Castello La Leccia 2010 Bruciagna Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),"Aromas of Mediterranean herb, balsam, eucalyptus and dark berry lead the nose. The firm, elegant palate delivers juicy black cherry, dried blackberry, black pepper, clove, thyme, orange peel and anisette alongside youthfully austere but fine-grained tannins. Let this wine develop. Drink 2017–2022."
US,85,16,Syrah,red,San Simeon 1999 Syrah (Arroyo Seco),"Dark and rich, with plummy, tomato flavors and quite a bit of tannin. It's very dry, with a real bite of acidity. Doesn't have the stuffing for aging, but it is a big, clean bruiser of a wine, and will drink nicely with rich foods."
US,87,35,Chardonnay,white,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2011 KARIA Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"This big-production wine from Stag's Leap hits all the popular Chardonnay buttons. It's soft and sweet, with orange and pineapple jam, buttercream, vanilla and toast flavors, brightened by crisp acidity. The grapes come from the cooler, southern parts of the valley."
US,86,40,Chardonnay,white,Bernardus 2012 Rosella's Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Buttered toast, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors dominate. The underlying fruit flavors suggest mangoes, pears and limes. Drink this oaky wine now."
US,90,80,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Spoto 2014 Cuvée Susan Diane Oakville Station Red (Napa Valley),"This Merlot-dominated wine includes 28% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. Its personality has bright and brooding sides, edged with subtle sage perfume, juicy dark cherry flavors and sizable oak."
US,90,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Eberle 2012 Eberle Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Coming from Gary Eberle's pioneering, 31-year-old vineyard, this presents fresh blueberries, smoke, cedar and a hearty mocha touch on the nose. It's thick on the palate but cut with strong acidity, showing flavors of chocolate-covered espresso bean, blackberry fruit and coffee grinds that last deep into the finish."
US,85,18,Pinot Gris,white,Bunnell 2012 Wine O' Clock Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine seems slightly past peak with aromas of overripe apple, lees and pear. It's lightly sweet with the concentration not seeming all there."
US,88,26,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Black Stallion 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"A touch of honey brings a sense of sweetness to the flavors of lemon candy, pineapple juice, green melon and vanilla. Tart acidity provides fine vitality and balance. This shows real Napa Valley finesse."
Italy,85,10,White Blend,white,Monte Zovo 2016  Soave,"Exotic fruit, honeysuckle and apple aromas commingle on the nose of this wine. The palate is less expressive, offering simple, faint white peach and citrus notes, with crisp acidity. It finishes fresh and clean."
US,86,9,Red Blend,red,Monte Volpe 2007 Primo Rosso Red (Mendocino County),"A liquid tribute to old Mendocino, this wine is a blend of mostly Zinfandel and Petite Sirah, with smaller proportions of Sangiovese, Carignane, Negromaro, Barbera, Nebbiolo and Syrah. Medium bodied with spicy black pepper, leather and stewed plum flavors, it would go perfectly well with burgers or pizza."
US,87,16,Red Blend,red,Tamarack Cellars 2015 Firehouse Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Cabernet Sauvignon (30%) takes the lead on this wine, followed by Merlot (21%), Syrah (17%), Cabernet Franc (14%) and five other varieties. Aromas of blue fruit, char, plum, herb, confection and spice are followed by easy-drinking plum flavors, with a slightly clipped finish. It's a pleasant easy drinker."
US,89,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Carden 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This barrel-forward (60% new French oak), 100% varietal wine offers notes of vanilla, pencil lead and wood spices along with cherry and herb accents. The smooth flavors are etched by tart acids, with grainy, dry tannins rounding it out."
US,90,45,Pinot Noir,red,Merry Edwards 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Sourced from six different vineyards, this is a broadly pleasing wine, fruity in blackberry and raspberry that veers even into cranberry and cassis territory without getting bogged down. Substantial and lush, it's tightly woven in tannin and savory herb, ready to open itself over time. Patience will reward with more exotic interweavings of vanilla-cola and tea."
Italy,86,48,Sangiovese,red,Cordella 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,"Aromas include black berries, coffee, espresso and grilled Mediterranean herbs. The one-dimensional palate lacks the essential fruit richness needed to support the bracing, astringent tannins that give a drying, bitter character. It also displays evident alcohol sensations despite the modest alcohol."
US,88,25,Sangiovese,red,Walla Walla Vintners 2013 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas bring appeal, with notes of sour cherry, herbs and spice. The palate is light bodied, tart and elegant, with a coffee-filled finish. It's a pretty expression of the variety."
US,89,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Barrister 2005 Bacchus Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This has a great nose, with bright cherry and berry fruit. Berry, black cherry, coffee and earth components combine in a pleasing and muscular blend. The midpalate is broad and chewy, with plenty of liquorous highlights. Tannins are a bit drying and the finish shows some sharp alcoholic burn."
US,87,50,Pinot Noir,red,Twomey 2009 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"A solid Pinot Noir, silky and rich in raspberry, cherry and smoky oak flavors. Notable for its silky texture and balancing acidity, it's a lovely wine to drink now and over the next few years."
US,95,52,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Betz Family 2009 Clos de Betz Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of 65% Merlot, 29% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% Petit Verdot, this is slightly more open and accessible than the companion Cabernet Sauvignon, but it's clearly structured for cellaring. The plump, expressive midpalate opens generously and spreads fully across the tongue, offering notes of cherry, cassis, licorice and pepper."
France,87,9,White Blend,white,Domaines Paul Mas 2009 ClaudeVal Blanc White (Vin de Pays d'Oc),"For a sort of kitchen sink blend composed of Grenache Blanc, Chenin Blanc, Mauzac, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino and Chasan, this wine is surprisingly pleasing and easy to drink with flavors of lively melon, stone fruit and accents of lime citrus. Versatile for food pairing, easy to drink and a terrific value."
US,92,45,Zinfandel,red,Gary Farrell 2010 Bradford Mountain Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This 100% Zin erupts in briary, peppery wild raspberry, blueberry and cherry flavors. The tannins are firm, and the acids crisp and savory. What a lovely Zinfandel, made in the soft, velvety style of Merlot, but with Bradford Mountain power."
Italy,89,20,Red Blend,red,PoderNuovo a Palazzone 2011 Therra Red (Toscana),"Montepulciano, Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes team up to produce this firmly structured but accessible red. The palate delivers ripe black cherry, red currants and tobacco lightly accented with oak-driven spice. It's balanced with firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2016."
US,83,33,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Textbook 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This wine is both reduced and diluted, with astringency biting at its heels. It may simply be underripe."
Italy,85,9,Sangiovese,red,Villa Giulia 2000 Alaura  (Chianti),"With cherry aromas, some cedar and a perfectly clean, unmuddled palate, this is what an affordable Chianti should be like. Simple and easy to drink, it will go fine with basic fare."
US,92,50,Chardonnay,white,Tongue Dancer 2015 Bacigalupi Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Tropical and slightly reduced, this complex wine from the famous Westside Road site is peachy and dripping in caramel. Baked apple adds to the lush, plush and richly robust palate, which finishes with balanced acidity and a taste of salty pretzel."
US,86,22,Pinot Noir,red,Redhawk 2009 Estate Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Broad across the palate, the new vintage of Redhawk's estate bottling opens with mixed berry and watermelon flavors, and thins out quickly. The fruit is outweighed by the alcohol, which is strong enough to burn a bit in the finish."
US,82,33,Pinot Noir,red,Midnight 2007 Aquarius Pinot Noir (Paso Robles),"Tastes raw and overripe, with raisiny flavors. The raisin skin tannins accentuate the grape tannins, leading to a hard, astringently dry finish."
Italy,89,35,Red Blend,red,Lanciola 2009 Le Masse di Greve Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"This wine opens with slightly rustic, leafy aromas that blow off in the glass to reveal mature black fruit and spice. The soft palate offers up ripe black cherry, blackberry and cinnamon. It's round and ready so enjoy soon."
US,86,20,Chardonnay,white,Belhurst 2011 Chardonnay (Seneca Lake),"Leesy, yeasty notes lend a savory feel to freshly-pressed apple and herb flavors in this easy-drinking Chardonnay. It's dry in style with a delicate mouthfeel that's accentuated by bright streaks of lemony acidity."
US,84,28,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Oak Farm 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"This oaky wine smells like baking spices and tastes almost sweet. It has jammy fruit flavors, warm vanilla and cinnamon accents, a soft texture and vanilla echoes on the finish."
US,84,24,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Columbia Crest 2015 Reserve Zirkle Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Horse Heaven Hills),"This wine starts out a bit reduced before it opens to display aromas of kiwi, pineapple and pink grapefruit. The flavors drink dry and seem quite dilute."
US,89,20,Chardonnay,white,Paraiso Vineyards 2014 Chardonnay (Monterey),"Red apple, light pineapple and key lime cream show on the nose of this twist-top bottling from the regionally pioneering Smith family. The palate is tightly wound and full of intriguingly delicate depth, offering pencil lead, shiso leaf, daikon radish, lemon-lime, sea foam and oyster shells."
US,87,30,Chardonnay,white,Dogwood 2010 McMinn Vineyards Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This Chardonnay straddles the line between complexity and simplicity, with toasty orange and pineapple flavors brightened with citrusy acidity. Savory minerality adds interest and food friendliness."
US,90,40,Pinot Noir,red,Calera 1997 Melange Pinot Noir (Mount Harlan),"A blend of lots left over from Calera's three prime vineyards, it's an intriguing combination of delicacy and power. The color is pale, the aroma is cola-like and it's light on the palate. But the depth of fruit is great, and so is the complexity. This wine will age well."
France,85,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Larroque 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur,"This is a dry wine, its fruit lost in the tannic structure. It has some fine acidity and could well open up as the young fruit matures. Try again from 2017."
US,86,18,Zinfandel,red,Brazin 2011 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"Aromatically rich in red cherry and black currant fruit, this is a lean Zin despite its 15% alcohol. Tar, cedar and chocolate dominate the palate."
France,92,65,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Ferret 2014 Hors Classe Les Ménétrières  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"Bright and fruity with touches of wood, this is a complex wine with good acidity, a crisp texture and a strong mineral strain. It is rich and will age well. Drink from 2017."
US,87,32,Merlot,red,Pope Valley Winery 2013 Eakle Ranch Merlot (Napa Valley),"Big, smoky fruit and a nicely honed structure combine well in this full-bodied wine with touches of red cherry and berry and toasted wood."
US,88,28,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Silver Trident 2014 Symphony No 9 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Soft and supple in lemon and melon, this 100% varietal white was given time in both stainless steel and neutral oak, the combination rewarding in a rounded, approachable mouthfeel that's both creamy and ripe. Stone fruit makes an appearance, before the wine finishes lean and tart."
US,86,16,White Blend,white,Atwater 2009 Riewürz White (Finger Lakes),"A blend of just over one-third Riesling, Atwater's Riewürz boasts a steely precision that cuts through all of Gewürztraminer's ebullient floral and juicy fruit characteristics. Semidry on the palate, with deliciously concentrated pomelo flavors, it finishes on a zesty, candied orange-peel note."
US,91,42,Syrah,red,Belden Barns 2014 Estate Grown Syrah (Sonoma Mountain),"Thick on the nose in black pepper and garrigue, this wine is velvety in layers of berry and cherry, with a hearty tobacco chaser. Concentrated and duly ripe, it brightens in the glass to show compelling bursts of white pepper and violet."
US,91,48,Chardonnay,white,Testarossa 2014 Fogstone Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This winery not only makes a bunch of single vineyard bottlings, but also tries to show off different styles. This one shows sweeter white peach, ripe cantaloupe, lush mango and a touch of vanilla on the nose. The palate is ripe and round with more mango, melon, papaya and banana flavors, yet that opulence is bound by chalky structure and lots of back-end acid."
US,87,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Spoto 2009 Cuvée Alexi Red (Oakville),"Although this is from Oakville, which is hallowed ground for Bordeaux-style wines, it's fairly simple and direct. With a soft, drink-me-now mouthfeel, it offers flavors of blackberries, black currants and mocha."
US,91,38,Chardonnay,white,Boekenoogen 2011 Estate Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Vanilla soda, pineapple and a touch of herbaceousness hit the nose first in this Chardonnay, which is grown high in the Santa Lucia range by a family that's ranched the land since the 1850s. On the palate, some creaminess emerges alongside flavors of tart green apple and toffee nuts. Serve with lemon-herb chicken or well-seasoned fish dishes."
US,91,34,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Rendarrio Vineyards 2013 First Born King Red (Paso Robles),"Dark in the glass, this blend of 75% Grenache and 25% Syrah is rich and appealing, made in the typical Paso style. Vanilla, cola, spice cake and black cherry aromas lead to a palate laden with milk chocolate, more black cherry, and star anise flavors. The tannins are soft and lush."
US,90,20,Pinot Noir,red,Bruliam 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"This was made from a saignée after a full-day's skin contact, resulting in a sultry, soulful, tiny-production wine that's refreshing and fruity in orange and lime, dry and completely in balance."
US,81,13,Red Blend,red,Kitchen Sink NV Winemaker's Reserve Red (California),"Black pepper and acidity, compounded by a lack of richness, combine to make this wine scoury. It has flavors of sour cherry candy and tobacco."
France,83,14,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Ginestet 2012  Bordeaux,"This is a structured wine, with too many tannins from wood and fruit. The red berry fruits are likely always to remain second to the structure."
US,95,70,Pinot Noir,red,Holdredge 2014 Judgment Tree Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is made in tiny amounts, which is heartbreakingly sad given its deliciousness and provenance, the grapes hailing from the Rochioli Sweetwater site on Westside Road. Spice box and sweet black-cherry flavors are lightly oaked and layered with velvety texture, the wine full-bodied and totally balanced."
US,86,35,Pinot Noir,red,Prosper 2014 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This brushy, foresty wine offers big, ripe blackberry and cherry flavor around a smoky core of oak."
Italy,88,29,Red Blend,red,Villa di Geggiano 2008 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Made with Sangiovese and 3% Cabernet Sauvignon, it opens with aromas of plum, berry, spice, leather and a hint of toast. The palate holds fleshy black cherry accented with notes of cinnamon and clove alongside aggressive, dusty tannins that overwhelm the finish. It closes on a drying note."
US,92,85,Merlot,red,Flora Springs 2012 Windfall Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"This is a lovely, 100% varietal wine, balanced between savory, almost sanguine meaty notes, and complex layers of cassis, plum and blueberry. Medium bodied with an elegance at its core, it has streaks of subtle cinnamon that give spiciness, and a finish dusted in Mexican chocolate."
US,85,13,Chardonnay,white,Mercer Canyons 2012 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This was 40% barrel-fermented, and carries a whiff of oak in the aroma. Apple scents and flavors follow. It's fresh, forward and fruity, with simple, straightforward flavors."
Italy,88,15,Sangiovese,red,Pieve de' Pitti 2013 Cerretello  (Chianti Superiore),"This all-Sangiovese Chianti offers black-skinned fruit and new leather aromas. The firm palate delivers prune and ripe tangerine fruit, framed by smooth tannins."
France,87,13,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château La Jalgue 2015  Bordeaux,"This is a concentrated wine with fine tannins and juicy black-plum fruits. It is densely textured, packed with great fruit and developing well. Drink from 2018."
US,88,27,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Saltbird 2014 Migratus Sauvignon Blanc (North Fork of Long Island),"Six months in French oak lend a rounded feel and delicate spice to pressed apple and lemon flavors in this wine. While less forward and fruity in style than most New York Sauvignon Blanc, its richer body and slightly salty, saline palate are enticing."
Italy,83,16,Pinot Grigio,white,Lechthaler 2014 Drago Pinot Grigio (Trentino),"The nose isn't very expressive but you can detect whiffs of adhesive bandage, medicinal herb, apple skin and mineral that carry over to the diluted, rather bitter palate. Brisk acidity underscores the wine's lean character."
US,88,29,Sangiovese,red,Rivino 2013 Estate Sangiovese (Mendocino),"The color of this medium-bodied wine is quite light, which is natural for some Sangioveses. Aromas recall mellow spices and light fruits, while the flavors are moderate and the texture smooth, almost light."
France,92,36,Chardonnay,white,Pascal Bouchard 2014 Les Vieilles Vignes Montmains Premier Cru  (Chablis),"The wine is ripe and firm with great concentration. It comes from old vines in this southeast-facing vineyard. Rich and full of white stone fruits that are cut with citrus, it is a wine to age. The aftertaste has spice and strong minerality. Drink this wine from 2019."
France,96,476,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Faiveley 2014  Bienvenues Bâtard-Montrachet,"This wine is rich, concentrated and ripe. With its opulent mix of yellow fruits, citrus and sliced apple—a real fruit salad—it is also balanced with spice and wood flavors. The fruit is rich and will develop well. Drink this from 2020."
France,94,145,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Leflaive 2008 Clavoillon Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),"Beautiful lemon-scented wine, balancing rich butter and apricot flavors with intense, pure acidity. The wine at this stage is toast and fruit, still coalescing into its long-term future."
Italy,93,40,Red Blend,red,Altesino 2012 Alte d'Altesi Red (Toscana),"A blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this supple, delicious wine opens with aromas of blackberry, tilled soil, leather, vanilla and tobacco. The juicy palate doles out black cherry, fleshy plum, well-integrated oak and graphite. It's balanced with firm but fine-grained tannins and modest acidity. Drink through 2019."
Italy,88,13,Red Blend,red,Falesco 2010 Vitiano Red (Umbria),"You can't beat this low price. No wonder Vitiano is a constant feature on wine lists at restaurants across Rome. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese offers spicy oak notes, with suggestions of ripe cherry, blackberry and spice."
US,89,18,Syrah,red,Buttonwood 2014 Rosé of Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"There's the slightest touch of sourdough-like yeast on the nose of this wine from the longtime organic vineyard. That gives intrigue to the ripe watermelon, bubblegum and buttery cherry aromas. Verve on the palate conveys red fruit cut by a rain-on-cement minerality."
US,85,13,Riesling,white,Fulkerson 2016 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Notes of earth and dust amplify savory tones of pressed apple and cider. Brisk lemon-lime acidity on the palate lends some brightness. The finish is moderately long, accented by a kiss of honeycomb. Drink now."
France,91,60,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Bouchié-Chatelier 2014 Premier Millésime  (Pouilly-Fumé),"Rich and ripe, this has concentration both from the apple, pear and apricot fruits and also from its steely, mineral texture. It's deliciously full in the mouth. Drink from late 2017."
US,87,22,Pinot Noir,red,Lane Tanner 2000 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"The “least” of Lane Tanner's range of Pinots, but complex and delicious. Ripe berry and spice flavors are rich, and there's a tangy earthiness suggesting sauteed mushrooms. Very dry and crisp, with a silky texture and a long, smooth finish."
US,91,38,Chardonnay,white,White Rock Vineyards 2014 Estate Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Bright, forceful and slightly reductive, this white is aged less than a year in neutral French oak, allowing the fruit to speak and offer richness on the midpalate. Gingerbread and lemongrass flavors accent its essential core of green apple fruit."
France,89,27,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Haut Beyzac 2005 I Second Haut Beyzac  (Haut-Médoc),"A new wood aged selection of vines from Château Haut Beyzac, a property being restored by Pennsylvanian Daren Miller and his French in-laws. It is delicious, elegant, offering classic black currant flavors of Bordeaux, but with an extra depth and richness. Fine, elegant acidity to finish."
US,92,60,Pinot Noir,red,Merry Edwards 2012 Coopersmith Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Planted on a relatively cool site for the Russian River, the Laguna Ridge, this Pinot is velvety and lush in baked strawberry and black raspberry, a celebration of finely grown, ripe fruit, with sharp-edged acidity and waves of savory mocha. With pronounced oak that mellows in the glass, it should only become more interesting with a few more years in the cellar, through 2022."
France,94,65,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Léoville Barton 2007  Saint-Julien,"This is a great success for the year, a wine that is dense, characterized by balance between sweet fruit and solid tannins. Spice from the finely judged wood aging adds extra complexity, as do the plum and berry fruits. For aging."
US,88,15,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Big DeVine 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Fresh herb and black currant aromas lead to ripe black-cherry flavors. It's fruit-forward and provides a lot of easy-drinking appeal.
US,93,50,Pinot Noir,red,Loring Wine Company 2013 Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Winemaker Brian Loring's take on this coveted vineyard shows rhubarb, pencil lead and a very clove-y cinnamon aspect on the nose. Raspberries mark the core of the palate, but the edges are speckled with strong herbs, from oregano to juniper. It offers a great mix of fruit and spice."
France,87,20,Chardonnay,white,La Chablisienne 2005 La Sereine  (Chablis),"Named after the river that flows past Chablis, this is a ripe, fruity wine, with yellow fruit flavors and good ripeness. Unoaked, it has good concentration as well as richness."
US,87,8,Riesling,white,Girardet 2001 Estate Riesling (Umpqua Valley),"A lot of shale in the soils adds interest to this elegant, light, fairly soft wine. Off-dry and balanced, it represents good value. Flavors of apples, pears and blossoms lead; a soft finish with a hint of caramel wraps it up."
US,87,24,Chardonnay,white,White Oak 2008 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A good, rich Chardonnay, marked by pleasantly crisp acidity and a buttercreamy texture housing fruity flavors of pineapples, peaches, green apples and kiwi. Shows good Russian River character. Don't drink it too cold."
US,88,38,Chardonnay,white,Tantara 2007 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Very rich, creamy and oaky, made in the ripe, California style of Chardonnay. Brims with buttered toast, vanilla cream, and caramelized wood aromas and flavors riding over underlying pineapples, pears and limes. Flamboyant, if a little top-heavy. Ready now."
US,92,27,Chardonnay,white,Forgeron 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Roughly half of the blend is made from fruit that comes from 30-year-old vines. An addition of 6% Muscat adds a scent of tree fruit, and the lovely citrus and stone fruit flavors are enhanced by a fresh-baked bread note. It has excellent concentration and impeccable balance, plus a long, satisfying finish."
US,89,24,Red Blend,red,Vigilance 2014 Cimarron Red (Lake County),"Complex, flavorful but not too big, this layered wine has aromas like cedar and tobacco, and flavors like black cherry and mint. It offers a medium-full body and velvety texture."
US,94,95,Syrah,red,Cayuse 2010 Bionic Frog Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Dark and meaty, with aromatic hints of mustard seed, this has a slight bitterness around the edges, giving it focus and sharpness. A change in the barrel regimen now keeps it entirely in large format foudres. It's supple and lush, with mixed blue and black fruit, hints of citrus, and peppery umami notes."
US,91,42,Zinfandel,red,Kokomo 2013 Rockpile Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"One of the producer's smallest-production offerings, this wine displays depth and character, with a complementary tension between plum and cherry versus smoke and leather. Subtle in all its characteristics, it finishes with a burst of flavor and intensity."
Italy,91,32,White Blend,white,Monte del Frá 2002 Monastero Passito White (Veneto),"What stands out here is the wine's complexity. Dried apricots, honey and almond paste are framed by a tiny hint of mint or chopped basil. The wine is very sweet in the mouth but it is also balanced out by a blast of fresh acidity on the close. A blend of Garganega, Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Cortese."
US,89,30,Riesling,white,Figgins 2016 Estate Riesling (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is one of the only Rieslings to come out of the valley. The aromas are reserved for the variety, with notes of lime leaf, citrus, Bosc pear and nut oil. The palate drinks dry, and is flavorful, with abundant stone-fruit and citrus notes that linger. It seems a bit heavy handed but still brings enjoyment."
US,89,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Biltmore Estate 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),"North Carolina-based Biltmore turns to Dry Creek for Cabernet, with good results. The wine is dry, full-bodied and tannic, with briary, brambly flavors of sweet, wild blackberries, cherries, chamomile tea, cola and anise. It's a sophisticated wine to drink now, at a fair price."
US,90,38,Pinot Noir,red,Dragonette 2008 Cargasacchi-Jalama Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Delicious and exotic, with raspberry, cherry, Mandarin orange, date, cinnamon spice and sweet oak flavors that are deep and long on the finish. Amazing that the alcohol is so low for the ripeness. Could be brisker in acidity, as it feels somewhat melted, which limits ageability, but it's a beauty now with lamb chops."
US,89,24,Chardonnay,white,Phelps Creek 2007 Celilo Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"Rich Cushman made this wine; it nicely expresses the minerality and tight fruit that characterizes this excellent vineyard. This is at first a rather austere, compact wine, but it is dense with layers of flavor and representative of one of the most unique terroirs in the Pacific Northwest."
US,88,10,White Blend,white,Oak Knoll NV Toasted Cow White Vintners Blend White (Willamette Valley),"This delightful, off-dry white is a blend of Pinot Gris, Gewürztraminer, Müller Thurgau, Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling,  perfectly matched to deliver crisp, fruity aromatics and flavors of apples, oranges and pears. It's a terrific anytime quaffer."
US,94,45,Syrah,red,Cowhorn 2012 Syrah 20 Syrah (Applegate Valley),"The best Syrah yet from this biodynamic producer, this was fermented with native yeast and spent 10 months in 40% new French oak. It's a sleek, subtle and immensely complex wine that knits together beautifully. Juicy boysenberries, composted earth, iron filings and veins of coffee liqueur and licorice compound into a long finish."
US,88,46,Pinot Noir,red,Roessler 2009 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Roessler produces lots of single-vineyard wines, but this has not been one of their best ones. It's a good wine, not without interest, with plenty of compact cherry, raspberry and sandalwood flavors. But it's very acidic. Decant it for hours."
US,86,45,Zinfandel,red,Summers 2014 Two Acre Villa Andriana Vineyard Estate Zinfandel (Calistoga),"This is a smoky, earthy wine that's fully ripe and flush in juicy fruit. Cherry, blackberry and grilled mushrooms find cinnamon and cola flavors as a tart finish builds on the palate."
France,84,12,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Château Haut Maurin 2016  Bordeaux Blanc,"This is a fat wine with light, juicy acidity. Honey and spice notes add interest to its broad melon and apple flavors."
US,89,12,Riesling,white,Trio Vintners 2006 Lewis Vineyards Riesling (Yakima Valley),"This is a lovely, orange blossom special. Sweet and tart, penetrating and long, with lovely peaches, apricots and oranges lighting it up."
Italy,90,41,Red Blend,red,Terrabianca 2004 Campaccio Red (Toscana),"The match of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon seems perfect. The wine's great ability is in offering soft, round cherry tones backed by more typical notes of forest berry and blue flower. Its texture is plush, and the vibrant midpalate closes with bright fruit."
Italy,88,15,Pinot Grigio,white,Bonotto delle Tezze 2010 Montesanto Pinot Grigio (Piave),"This “ramato” or copper-hued Pinot Grigio opens with bright aromas of bitter almond, honey, peach and exotic fruit. Its texture is smooth and soft."
France,87,15,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Alain Jaume et Fils 2014 Réserve Grand Veneur Red (Côtes du Rhône),"This wine is superripe and fruit-forward, loaded with black cherry and plum fruit. It might even be a bit warm on the palate, but ends on a supple, silky note. Drink now–2020."
US,84,20,Zinfandel,red,Headbanger 2009 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Here's a simple, easy Zin for downing with barbecue, mac and cheese, that sort of thing. It's light in body and silky, with candied raspberry and spice flavors."
US,86,13,Chardonnay,white,Cameron Hughes 2015 lot 533 Limestone Cowboy Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"Lots of white flowers, from jasmine to lilies, show on the nose of this well-priced bottling, alongside poached pears and lime sorbet. The palate packs tangy pungency, with Anjou pear and Granny Smith apple flavors."
US,86,23,Chardonnay,white,Truett Hurst 2012 California Square Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This widely produced Chardonnay is soft and oaky, with honey-infused vanilla, mango and Meyer lemon flavors. It's your basic Chardonnay, creamy and easy to drink."
US,92,54,Syrah,red,Caliza 2012 Syrah (Paso Robles),"An incredibly rich wine not for the faint of heart, this shows blackberry jam, espresso, condensed lilacs and expresso syrup on the nose. It gets more intense on the palate, with chocolate syrup, thick fudge, dense blueberry fruits, black tobacco and espresso extract that push concentration levels to the delightfully extreme."
US,89,16,White Blend,white,Cor Cellars 2009 Alba Cor White White (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"A fine bottle, roughly half Pinot Gris, half Gewürztraminer, from the Celilo vineyard. The PG is 25 years old; it's a blend that works really well in vintages where the vineyard gets sufficient heat, and 2009 was just about perfect. Partially barrel fermented, it sends up scents and flavors of citrus—lime and orange—with a pleasing roundness from roughly one percent residual sugar."
Italy,86,19,Pinot Grigio,white,Ascevi Luwa 2011 Ronco dei Vignali Pinot Grigio (Collio),"Ronco dei Vignali opens with exotic fruit, fragrant nectarine, papaya and lemongrass on the finish. The bouquet is very beautiful and the mouthfeel is tame and understated in comparison."
US,89,50,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Dragonette 2007 MJM Red (California),"You might want to lay this Syrah-based Rhône wine down for a year or two. Tasted in the early fall of 2010, it's sharp and fresh-fruity, which gives the cherry, raspberry and cocoa a jammy taste. The grapes come from Paso Robles and Santa Barbara County."
US,92,39,Pinot Noir,red,Williams Selyem 2013 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"Juicy strawberries and plum are cut with allspice and star anise on the sharply spiced nose of this wine from one of the Golden State's legendary producers. The palate shows the juice of darker berries, from blackberries to black cherries, with an Earl Grey tea bitterness and dried sage complexity."
US,98,265,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Shafer 2012 Hillside Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"The highly sought-after, perennially beautiful and brawny Hillside Select is 100% estate grown and 100% varietal. It wows after three years in barrel, painting a lush picture of tobacco, tea and firm, integrated tannin dusted in smoky clove scents. Intensely peppery, its youthful blackberry and cherry flavors shine through but will benefit from even more time in bottle, through 2032."
France,92,75,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Bahans Haut-Brion 2005  Pessac-Léognan,"The second wine of Château Haut-Brion is firm, mirroring its grand vin. It is dark, brooding and dense, rounded by ripe fruits. There is also an edge of bitter chocolate that offers an intriguing counterpoint to the elegance of the fruit."
France,84,14,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Caville 2014  Bordeaux,"From the east of the Bordeaux region, this light and juicy wine has attractive, forward acidity and the gentlest of tannins. Fresh and fruity, it is ready to drink."
US,91,65,Pinot Noir,red,Testarossa 2015 Brosseau Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chalone),"From the vineyard owned by winemaker Bill Brosseau's family, this bottling shows black raspberry, strawberry, wet slate and rose petal scents on the nose. The palate is loaded with earthy black plum and other dark fruits, lifted by a star anise spiciness."
US,89,35,Pinot Noir,red,Hahn 2011 SLH Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"The silky texture is delightful, giving it the lightness desirable in Pinot Noir. Santa Lucia acidity gives a bright edge to the cherry, cola, pomegranate and heirloom tomato flavors. Drink now–2014 for maximum freshness."
US,89,119,Merlot,red,HammerSky 2013 Straight de Barrel Merlot (Paso Robles),"This squat bottle comes, indeed, straight from the barrel with no filtering, and works quite well. Bright and plump purple fruits mix with vanilla and a tickling acidity on the nose. The palate shows juicy cherry fruit as well as blackberry and blueberry, with richness from vanilla and caramel. The tannins are a bit tough, but rugged in the right ways."
France,90,55,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Graves de Pez 2010  Saint-Estèphe,"The wine comes from a small, seven-acre property. This 2010 is structured with a mineral character and chewy tannins. It is well balanced; the blackberry fruit synchronizes well with the dry texture and fresh acidity. Age for 4–5 years."
US,94,54,Zinfandel,red,Limerick Lane 2014 1910 Block Estate Grown Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Robust and richly layered, this block-designate from the producer's estate is sly in complexity, pumping its fist in ripeness and concentration before slowly unfurling elements of dusty black cherry, black olive and fig. The finish teases in white pepper and cardamom."
Italy,91,90,Sangiovese,red,Villa I Cipressi 2012 Zebras  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Forest floor, leather, tobacco and menthol aromas take shape in the glass. The palate is tense and vibrant, offering raspberry, pomegranate, licorice and espresso notes, bolstered by tightly wound tannins. Drink after 2020."
US,88,30,Red Blend,red,Melrose 2010 Equinox Red (Umpqua Valley),"This late release is an unusual blend of Syrah, Baco Noir, Tempranillo and Dolcetto. All are strengths of the AVA, though rarely blended together. The extra bottle age has smoothed the rough edges, yielding a pleasant-drinking wine with flavors of strawberry preserves, citrus peel, and a touch of malt powder."
US,89,32,Pinot Noir,red,Longoria 2012 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Here, Pinot Noir master Richard Longoria offers a more affordable taste of his Fe Ciega estate vineyard (whose other expressions cost upwards of $45 each). Aromas range from cranberry and tart blackberry to black pepper and wet slate, and the flavors hone in on sour cherry and tar. This wine features gripping tannins, so wait until 2016 for an even more optimal experience."
US,90,55,Pinot Noir,red,Siduri 2015 Pratt Vineyard Sexton Road Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Eucalyptus, Bay laurel and other herbal aromas dominate the nose of this wine, making way for black tea and cola flavors. Full-bodied and robustly ripe with powerful tannin, it's ultimately earthy and complex."
US,88,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Dutton Estate 2010 Kylie's Cuvée Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"This is Dutton Estate's unoaked Sauvignon Blanc. It did not go through the malolactic fermentation, but it started as very ripe grapes, so what you get is pure citrus, Asian pear, white peach and green apple flavor, zesty and clean in acidity, with slight a sweetness in the finish. Nice with Indian, Chinese, Vietnamese fare."
US,88,25,Merlot,red,Clos du Val 2000 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Made in a restrained, elegant style, with modulated blackberry, currant and herb flavors balanced with oak. Dry, supple and polished, this young wine needs a year or two in the cellar to gain complexity."
France,86,13,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Cheval Quancard 2016 Cuvée Clémence  (Entre-Deux-Mers),"This is a spicy, herbal wine. Its crisp lemon flavor is lifted by perfumed Muscadelle in the blend to give a wine that has a warm edge to balance the acidity. It is ready to drink."
US,88,45,Syrah,red,Milbrandt 2014 Single Vineyard Series Clifton Hill Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"This shows vanilla, clove, barrel spice and dark fruit aromas. Its fruit flavors are full and laced with upfront barrel notes. It seems a little boozy."
France,90,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château de Cornemps 2014 Cuvée Prestige  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"This is a full, ripe wine. It has red fruits, black currants and a rich seam of tannins. There is also a smoky character that adds attraction. With a ripe aftertaste, the wine is developing well and should be ready from 2018."
US,88,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Clos Pegase 2011 Mitsuko's Vineyard Musqué Clone Sauvignon Blanc (Carneros),"Ripe lemon, lime, grapefruit and tropical fruit flavors, touched with sweet, smoky oak, combine with brisk acidity to make this 100% Sauvignon Blanc instantly likeable. It has a touch of lemongrass and gooseberry that makes it savory."
France,85,12,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Briot 2013  Bordeaux Blanc,"Fresh and floral, this is a soft and ripe wine. With lemon and lime flavors tempered by apricots and pears, it offers a delicious fruit salad of flavors. The aftertaste is rich and juicy."
France,93,37,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Sébastien Dampt 2013 Vaillons Premier Cru  (Chablis),"From a 2.4-acre vineyard with vines that are 60 years old, this is a tight, mineral wine, very pure and with a line of acidity and crisp apple flavors. Very perfumed, it is fresh but also densely textured, finishing with tannins and concentration as well as liveliness. Drink from 2018."
US,90,55,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Lachini 2012 La Contrada Red (Red Mountain),"This blend is principally Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot with a pinch of Petit Verdot blended in. The barrel aromas (24 months in all-new French) stand out at first, with notes of chocolate, coffee and spice. The black-fruit flavors are full bodied and high-octane, showing some warmth on the finish. The oak needs more time to integrate."
France,84,14,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Nicolas Idiart 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Val de Loire),"While this wine has hints of a green herbal character, its main character conveys creamed apples and even riper fruits such as white peach. It is soft and lightly textured with just a touch of final acidity. Drink now."
France,90,25,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château la Tour Blanche 2014 Charmilles  (Sauternes),"This soft wine is still waiting for its intensity to come through. The acidity is there, as is ripe, honeyed fruit. Wait until 2022 to open it."
France,84,13,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Les Alliés 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France),"This ripe, fruity wine delivers tropical fruit, apricot and white plum flavors. Its warm acidity leaves a rounded, creamy aftertaste."
US,85,18,Zinfandel,red,Mounts 2009 Estate Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A sound, everyday Zinfandel, this may be a little green and underripe, but it does show some berry-cherry flavor. The alcohol is very high."
US,88,22,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Kestrel 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"True to the vintage, this is a rather hard and chewy Cabernet, yet it captures both varietal and vintage character in a style that is ready for that sizzling steak off the grill. Lightly herbal, with black cherry, cassis, coffee and bitter chocolate streaks, it's a firm and well-balanced wine with the potential to age over the next decade or so."
US,88,36,Red Blend,red,Columbia Winery 2012 Limited Release Element Red (Wahluke Slope),"Merlot dominant with a balance of Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine shows aromas of vanilla, coconut and jammy red and black fruit, with the alcohol poking through. The fruit flavors feel supple, backed by gritty tannins."
US,90,45,Pinot Noir,red,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2013 Vintage 40 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Honoring the 40th vintage for these vines, planted at Tualatin Estate in 1973, this elegant and subtle wine shows pinpoint varietal character. It charms immediately with scents of dusty baking spices and cherry pie. Flavors follow into a graceful and proportionate finish."
US,90,15,Pinot Gris,white,A to Z 2016 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"Sometimes less is more, and sometimes more is more, as in this 68,000-case offering from A to Z. It's a leesy, pretty, highly gulpable wine, loaded with apple, pear and melon fruit. Hints of cucumber and stone add freshness to the lingering aftertaste."
US,93,42,Syrah,red,Lawrelin 2002 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This project aimed to show how well Washington wines can age and the proof is in the bottle. Aromas are complex, with notes of dried cranberry, cherry, leather, black tea, cocoa and mushroom. The palate is packed with rich fruit flavors that show no signs of slowing down. It flat-out impresses."
US,86,9,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Alias 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Made from 100% Cabernet, this is a great house wine for the price. It's dry, full-bodied and tannic, with proper black currant, blackberry, mocha and oak flavors. Easy to find, with 20,000 cases produced."
US,86,26,Chardonnay,white,Paoletti 2008 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Sweet and oaky, this Chard tastes like a vanilla and caramel cream soda, with alcohol and a squirt of pineapple essence. Defines the superripe, opulent style, without much complexity."
US,89,20,Pinot Noir,red,Sokol Blosser 2013 Estate Rosé of Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Grapes for this wine were cool fermented in stainless steel and bottled quickly. Fresh as a wine can be, this is redolent of rhubarb and strawberries, with a lightly minty/peppery note. The attention to detail gives the wine body and length."
US,92,60,Pinot Noir,red,MacMurray Estate Vineyards 2014 Winemaker's Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Velvety, robust structure makes way for a textured, complex personality of baked plum, rhubarb and cola spice. That spice continues in lengthy spikes of clove and cinnamon, providing a warmth that complements and accents the concentration."
US,87,35,Syrah,red,Montemaggiore 2007 Paolo's Vineyard Estate Grown Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"This is a very dry, tannic wine whose mouthfeel is too tough and astringent to enjoy now. It has lovely flavors of blueberries, blackberries, sweetly old leather, cola and peppery spices. Feels like there's enough depth to last for 4–5 years and let the wine soften."
US,83,8,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Redtree 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Thin and simple, dry and sharp, this has modest cherry, black pepper and mint flavors. Still, it has enough fruit to drink with a nice burger."
US,91,60,Pinot Noir,red,Lachini 2015 Lachini Family Estate Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Bright, fresh raspberry fruit takes the center stage in this young and still rather tight wine that will reward further cellaring. There's a hint of metal in the acids. Drink 2020–2030."
US,89,35,Merlot,red,Peju 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Here's a lovely red wine, soft and appealing, and perfect for drinking now. It's dry and silky in tannins, with intricately layered cherry, smoked meat, pepper and sandalwood flavors."
US,87,15,Chardonnay,white,Dominican Oaks 2007 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Rich and creamy, with fruit-forward flavors of pineapple jam, oranges, ripe peaches, vanilla and buttered toast. Crisp acidity gives balance and clean liveliness."
US,86,59,Pinot Noir,red,Envolve 2012 Lennox Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Raspberries, cherries, cola and persimmons are the flavors of this fairly standard Pinot Noir. It's dry and delicately structured, with good acidity and a discrete coating of oak. Drink now."
France,92,50,Pinot Noir,red,Mailly Grand Cru NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),"Pure Pinot Noir, an unusual style, gives a powerful rich character to a wine. This ripe, dense and full-bodied Champagne is full of apricot, pear and green plum flavors that are linked with the tight, lightly tannic texture. It is a well-balanced wine, ready to drink."
France,89,30,Chardonnay,white,Marcel Couturier 2014 Vielles Vignes  (Pouilly-Loché),"This is a spicy wine, with balanced wood, yellow-fruit flavors and acidity that cuts through the spice and ripeness. A zing of citrus finishes this attractive wine in style."
US,88,22,Pinot Noir,red,Dolin 2014 Rose of Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"From the Malibu-based producer, this bottling has a striking label design that matches with the youthful, vivacious pink wine. The punchy nose blends cherry, lime blossom and pink rose petals with yeasty, sourdough-like aromas, while the palate offers iron, maraschino cherry and lime-wedge flavors."
France,96,200,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Pichon Longueville 2009  Pauillac,"With a structure that runs between acidity and dark smoky tannins, this is a wine with potential opulence. It's very rich in character, dense and dark. The black plum flavors are dominant, along with excellent acidity. For the long-term."
France,88,25,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Louis Bernard 2011 Domaine de Montbayon Red (Vacqueyras),"Firm acids and softly dusty tannins give this medium-bodied red a welcome bit of structure. Meanwhile, hints of garrigue accent black cherries, with dried-fruit, licorice and cocoa flavors emerging on the finish. Drink now–2016."
Italy,90,29,Chardonnay,white,Villa Crespia NV Numerozero Dosaggio Zero Chardonnay (Franciacorta),"This lovely sparkling wine is made entirely from Chardonnay. It offers white peach, citrus and almond notes, a creamy texture, crisp acidity and a bone-dry finish."
US,90,18,Merlot,red,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2014 Indian Wells Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas bring notes of milk chocolate, spice and red fruit, along with high-toned vanilla accents. The fruit and barrel flavors are plush and full, while still showing a lovely sense of balance."
US,90,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,V. Sattui 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"There's a rich vein of green olives in this wine, alongside the blackberries, cocoa and toast. With smooth, brisk tannins, it's best opened over the next 2–3 years."
US,86,20,Pinot Gris,white,King Estate 2001 Reserve Pinot Gris (Oregon),"Higher in acids and lower in sugar than the regular bottling, and shares most of the same charactertistics. Packed with jammy white stone fruit and floral flavors. Lees adds a rich, creamy texture. Still, it's not a dry wine, and is best matched with dishes with some sweetness."
US,92,64,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Seavey 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Floral, exciting and chocolaty, this is a dense, rich, well-crafted beauty. Yummy is one of the best ways to describe it. It has full but friendly tannins, all the length you could ask for, and in the final analysis it leaves an impression of heft and significance."
US,91,12,Syrah,red,Columbia Crest 2015 Grand Estates Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas in this wine pop, with notes of dried herb, plum, vanilla and smoked meat. It brings a compelling sense of texture, coating the palate from end to end with exquisitely balanced fruit and savory flavors. It's a knockout at this price."
US,86,29,Chardonnay,white,Landmark 2007 Overlook Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"Dry and crisp in cool-climate coastal acidity, this polished Chard shows pretty flavors of pineapples, green apples, honey and oak spice. It's creamy, and made in the New World style."
US,87,18,Chardonnay,white,Waterbrook 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Barrel notes of toast, butterscotch and spice are at the fore along with melted butter and peach on this 100% Canyon Vineyard Ranch wine. It's full bodied with a rich, creamy feel, wanting a bit more concentration and acidity to keep it together."
France,84,23,Chardonnay,white,Jaffelin 2010 Les Chapitres de Jaffelin  (Bourgogne),"Round and softly fruity, this white Burgundy comes with a hint of vanilla. With its ripe apple, lime and yellow fruit flavors, it's instantly drinkable. The finish is touched by acidity."
US,86,15,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,401K 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"A gentle wine, this has warm, fruity aromas, ripe red cherry and raspberry flavors, a soft texture and fine-grained tannins. Medium to full bodied and almost sweet in balance, it's easy to enjoy."
US,91,62,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Chimney Rock 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"You'll want to give this young Cab some time in the cellar, because it's locked down in tannins. Buried underneath the astringency is a wealth of sweet black currants and savory anise and sandalwood. Try after 2011."
US,90,16,Syrah,red,Hogue 2009 Genesis Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Well made and muscular, this compact effort brings black fruit, black olive, black licorice and espresso flavors together in a balanced and strikingly complex Syrah. The blend includes small amounts of Cabernet, Lemberger, Sangiovese and Merlot—unusual, but it works."
France,86,16,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château la Fleur 2014  Montagne-Saint-Émilion,"This is a young, structured wine that needs some time to develop. It has stalky tannins over black-currant fruits that give the wine both structure and freshness. With its dusty texture and spice flavors from the wood aging, it will be best drunk from 2018."
US,90,44,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Epiphany 2012 Revelation Rodney's Vineyard Red (Santa Barbara County),"Concentrated violet aromas mix with dark blackberry and even blueberry fruit in this blend of 46% Syrah, 45% Grenache and 9% Petite Sirah, yet it remains quite fresh on the nose. The palate shows hibiscus, more aromatic blueberry elements and touches of cassis and vanilla."
US,91,25,Pinot Noir,red,Black Stallion 2013 Pinot Noir (Los Carneros),"Earthy in black tea and leathery funk, the feral aspects of this wine are entirely compelling, giving a savory edge around grippy, full-bodied texture and weight. A Pinot for Cabernet fans, it'll stand up to steak and a whole lot more, delivering tremendous value for the quality."
Italy,90,28,Red Blend,red,Castello della Paneretta 2011 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Red berry, chopped herb, blue flower and menthol all come together on this elegantly structured red. The juicy, accessible palate offers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and a hint of vanilla alongside round tannins. Drink through 2021."
US,92,24,Riesling,white,Trisaetum 2012 Coast Range Estate Dry Riesling,"Yet another fruit-powered, lip-smacking Riesling from Trisaetum, this brings a basket of yellow apples, tart limes, pears and a slice of pink grapefruit into perfect harmony. Leesy, textural, long and utterly refreshing, it finishes with a nice kick of bracing acidity."
US,90,48,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Sparkman 2010 Stella Mae Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Loaded with pretty black-cherry flavor, this is a Cabernet-based, Bordeaux-style blend. Sourced from Klipsun, Red Willow, Olsen and Stillwater Creek, it shows a fair amount of stiff, slightly green tannins. The earthy subtext is all in proportion, and this plays like a young Bordeaux. Give it some extra breathing time."
France,90,42,Riesling,white,Kuentz-Bas 2013 Geisberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Earth and smoke join fruity, fresh apples on the nose. The palate is equally apple-fruited and very appetizing, full of freshness and friendly fruit on a dry, slender body. The juicy, poised cleanliness lingers beautifully."
France,87,16,Red Blend,red,Château d'Aydie 2013 Domaine Mouréou Red (Madiran),"This wine has firm tannins certainly. However its main character is the delicious, juicy fruit that just bursts out of the glass. A fresh character suggests this wine will develop quickly, despite the tannic background. Drink from 2016."
US,87,60,Pinot Noir,red,Babcock 2011 Slice of Heaven Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Was it the chilly vintage that made this wine so elusive? Tasted in the spring, it was oaky and jammy with raspberries and cherries, with the astringent tannins of green herb tea. Hard to tell where it's going, if anywhere, but it does have dryness and vital acidity in its favor."
US,88,24,Pinot Noir,red,Spindrift Cellars 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Once again, Spindrift Cellars has released a friendly, fruit-forward Pinot Noir with bright strawberry, raspberry and cherry fruit. There's a streak of cola flavor leading into well-managed, supple tannins. Overall balance is just about perfect, and the spicy lift to the finish leaves you quickly wanting a second sip."
Italy,87,19,Sangiovese,red,Castello d'Albola 2008 Chianti Classico  (Chianti Classico),"Here's a wonderfully fresh and tangy Chianti Classico (Sangiovese with a tiny element of Canaiolo) that opens with a bright, ruby appearance and tangy notes of wild berry, white almond and blue violet. The mouthfeel is fresh and focused."
US,93,60,Pinot Noir,red,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2013 Great Oak Vineyard Suicide Hill Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine is produced in microscopic amounts, the result of sourcing grapes from a notoriously difficult-to-farm site. It rewards in flavor: hearty cherry and pomegranate fruit, a crisp, crunchy texture, powerful tannins and oak, and an underlying minerality that presents as elusively as a cloud of fog."
US,85,46,White Blend,white,Jack Nicklaus Wines 2012 Private Reserve White (Napa Valley),"Creamy vanilla and spritzy acidity surround a ripe core of baked apple and pear in this white. Full-bodied and touched by oak, it finishes clean and concentrated."
US,84,13,White Blend,white,Chaddsford 2007 Spring Wine White (Pennsylvania),"Lemon citrus, toast, white flowers—the lead on this wine is feminine and light and, as the name suggests, feels like a warm weather match. Flavors of like style are sweet and simple but balanced by some crispness and finesse. It's a pretty wine that offers simple, easy drinking enjoyment."
Italy,88,23,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Elena Walch 2002 Castel Ringberg Sauvignon Blanc (Alto Adige),"Fragrant, aromatic, grassy aromas give way to fresh, crisp, green fruit and gooseberry flavors. Finishes lively and vibrant."
US,94,70,Pinot Noir,red,Foxen 2015 Fe Ciega Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Delicate aromas of raspberry, sagebrush and white pepper make for a lighter yet complex expression of Pinot Noir from this estate vineyard of Richard Longoria, who's a regional veteran like the Foxen owners. Tart and taut flavors of black raspberry, pepper, oregano and leather combine for a very earthy experience, which is simultaneously subtle and stunning."
France,85,12,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Domaines Lapalu 2010 Famille Lapalu  (Médoc),"A soft wine, with some light wood aging while the fruit gives black currant stalkiness, dry tannins and fresh, juicy, smoky acidity. The wine needs no aging, but could develop for 2–3 years."
US,90,60,Red Blend,red,Cornerstone 2009 Red (Napa Valley),"Delicious, first class and possibly ageable. It's rich in blackberry pie filling, crême de cassis and sweet oak flavors, with a firm minerality that adds structural integrity. Sweet and ripe, but elegant. Will provide pleasant drinking over the next four years."
US,88,25,Pinot Gris,white,Sutcliffe 2011 Pinot Gris (Carneros),"A savory Pinot Gris that shows how well the variety can grow in Carneros. It was barrel fermented, which gives a creamy richness to the citrus and tropical fruit flavors. A nice edge of acidity adds a clean, bright mouthfeel."
Italy,94,49,Red Blend,red,Benanti 2005 Serra della Contessa  (Etna),"Serra della Contessa (named after Benanti's most beautiful and historic vineyard) is an important wine in the history of Etna winemaking because it was among the first to show the massive potential of this dramatic terrain. This wine is executed in a richer, more opulent style with excellent complexity and endurance, capped by bright aromas of spice, forest berry and light smoke nuances."
US,90,40,Pinot Noir,red,Sonoma-Loeb 2015 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Smoky bark and cola notes are cradled in reductive oak in this robust wine from a fantastically farmed site. Its dark berry flavor is supported by velvety tannin and juicy acidity, both of which provide moderate structure."
US,82,20,Sangiovese,red,Paoletti 2008 Fiore Sangiovese (Napa Valley),"Tastes as sweet as raspberry or cherry jam, with a cut of citrusy acidity. This rustic wine also has some firm, furry tannins."
US,89,54,Merlot,red,Duckhorn 2010 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Hard as nails in tannins, with mouth-numbing astringency. But the powerful fruit explodes right through, offering an array of blackberry jam, dark chocolate, raisin and anise flavors. Try cellaring it until at least 2019."
US,86,15,Riesling,white,Gamache 2014 Estate Grown Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Pear, almond and toast aromas lead to dry, elegant fruit and lees flavors. It's a uniquely styled offering of the variety."
France,87,26,Chardonnay,white,Frédéric Lornet 2011 Les Messagelins Chardonnay (Arbois),"The nose has a yeasty, meaty character, while the palate is toasty. Rich flavors include ripe plum and vanilla followed by fragrant acidity at the end."
Italy,90,40,Red Blend,red,Pasqua 2012 Famiglia Pasqua  (Amarone della Valpolicella),"This opens with aromas of mature black currant and dark baking spice. The full-bodied palate offers mature black cherry, ripe blackberry, licorice and pipe tobacco alongside a backbone of firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017 through 2022."
Italy,86,20,Red Blend,red,Cantina Novelli 2009  Montefalco Rosso,"A blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino, Merlot and Cabernet, this offers aromas of cherry-berry and dessert spices that carry over to the palate, along with a licorice note. It's ripe and round but also a bit tired, with a drying, tannic finish."
US,91,18,Chardonnay,white,Barra of Mendocino 2016 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Mendocino),"This full-bodied wine does a superb job of blending luscious fruit flavors of Anjou pear and fresh fig with a spice rack of nutmeg, vanilla and cinnamon. Good concentration and depth help it feel full and creamy on the palate and extend the finish nicely."
US,91,40,Red Blend,red,Clos du Bois 2013 Coro Mendocino Red (Mendocino),"An intriguing oak spiciness on both the nose and the palate makes this medium-bodied wine interesting without overpowering the focused and vivid raspberry and red cherry flavors. The wine's texture is lean, braced by fine-grained tannins that give support and balance. Best after 2018."
US,84,13,Chardonnay,white,River Road 2015 Un-Oaked Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"Fermented entirely in stainless steel, this is a simple, tropically sweet wine, characterized by mango, pineapple and juicy melon."
US,84,29,Zinfandel,red,Midnight 2010 Estate Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Old-school Zinfandel, with enormously high alcohol. It tastes heavy in brown sugar, blackberries and blackstrap molasses."
US,93,32,Pinot Noir,red,Piro 2015 Points West Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Marc Piro continued to hone his craft under Jim Clendenen at Au Bon Climat, and that expertise shows in this bottling, which combines Presqu'ile and Bien Nacido Vineyards to produce a wine that's both zesty in the underripe style yet full of fruit as well. Aromas of wild oregano, thyme, tapenade and red cherry lead into a palate full of tantalizing acidity, with tart Montmorency cherry, tangy tomato and fennel spice."
US,84,34,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Joullian 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Carmel Valley),"A bit herbal, green and sharp, this Cab has modest flavors of blackberries and cherries, enriched with some new French oak."
US,91,39,Chardonnay,white,Cebada 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Ynez Valley),"This bottling from a vineyard northwest of the Sta. Rita Hills opens with buttercream, lemon peel, lime spritz and toasted almond scents. The buttery quality extends to the full but energetic palate, where it's cut by lemon marmalade, savory smoke and toast notes. The finish is nutty."
US,87,20,White Blend,white,Tangent 2006 Ecclestone White (Central Coast),"A blend of six varieties, but it's not a simple wine made from the leftovers that some wineries use for blends. Instead, it's crisp and fruity, not as dry as Tangent's varietal wines, but rich in Muscat orange, Riesling flowers, Pinot Gris citrus, Viognier tropical fruit and Pinot Blanc peach. One percent Albariño seems to add to the acidity."
US,86,16,Red Blend,red,Fenestra NV True Red Lot 30 Red (California),"Spicy oak nuances and maturity give this full-bodied wine a broad range of peppery, leathery, cedary aromas and mellow flavors reminiscent of milk chocolate and tamarind. It's rustic but fun to taste."
US,91,30,Syrah,red,Syncline 2012 McKinley Springs Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"Coming from 12-year-old plantings that are just starting to hit their stride, this wine shows brooding notes of blueberry, rhubarb, herbs and espresso. The flavors show intensity and restraint with slightly gritty tannins."
US,85,27,Zinfandel,red,D-Cubed Cellars 2009 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Here's a soft, seemingly sweet Zin. Part of its apparent sweetness is from the glycerine of high alcohol; part is from the extracted flavors of raspberry, milk chocolate and caramelized oak. It's almost a dessert wine, but is nonetheless a good example of its style, which will appeal to lots of people."
France,86,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Baron Philippe de Rothschild 1995 Réserve Mouton Cadet  (Médoc),"Built along traditional lines, this claret features soft plummy Merlot fruit accented by leafy tobacco and cassis. Its cedary leanness makes it an ideal foil for rich meat dishes."
US,88,13,Zinfandel,red,Sobon Estate 2011 Old Vines Zinfandel (Amador County),"Sobon's Old Vines Zinfandel is seamless in bright red fruit and soft tannins, with a tempered spiciness on the finish. A great value and go-to wine for a crowd, this is ideal to stock up on for outdoor gatherings, or just to get through the winter."
US,85,20,Chardonnay,white,Chessman 2014 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"Toasted hazelnuts, lime zest and broad peach notes show on the nose of this bottling. The palate is relatively flat and easy with yellow apples and a tang of lemongrass with a buttered finish."
US,92,45,Pinot Noir,red,Scott Paul 2011 The Long Run Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Previously labeled as Les Gourmandises, this is now The Long Run in honor of Scott Wright's completing his first full-length marathon in 2011. It's all Nysa vineyard fruit, graceful and delicate, scented with rose water and satin smooth. Cranberry and wild strawberry fruit accents lead into a mouthful of cherry soda, delicate but lingering."
France,89,62,Pinot Noir,red,Joseph Drouhin 2008  Chambolle-Musigny,"Pure, ripe strawberry flavors are pierced with acidity. The texture is soft, with a dry side. The raspberry acidity cuts right to the end."
US,86,23,Riesling,white,Bellangelo 2015 Kashong Glen Vineyard Riesling (Seneca Lake),"Intensely earthy notes of crushed stone and dried clay offset sweet, slightly caramelized apples and pears. While light bodied and zippy, it finishes with a slightly waxy honeyed sweetness."
Italy,91,45,Sangiovese,red,Casa Sola 2011 Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),"Plum, truffle, tilled earth and a hint of mocha lead the nose while the ripe, round palate offers fleshy black cherry, crushed raspberry, baking spice and pipe tobacco. Velvety tannins support the savory flavors and carry through to the chewy, licorice finish. Drink through 2020."
US,87,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hawkes 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"This is dry and slightly herbal, with sage and dill notes to the cherry and blackberry flavors. But it's those Alexander Valley tannins, so soft and mellow, that mark it. Good now, and should ride out the next eight years."
US,89,34,Pinot Noir,red,Erath 1998 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"There’s a persistent menthol note running through this wine that may prove controversial. My money is that it will integrate with time (say, 2–3 years) into the otherwise rich cherry fruit. The finish is explosively fruity and long, which bodes well for the future."
US,86,12,Chardonnay,white,Charles & Charles 2012 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This young Chardonnay still shows plenty of yeasty scents and flavors, turning it almost beer-like. Light lemon and tea flavors, with a dash of baking spices, complete the picture."
US,91,45,Chardonnay,white,Roar 2015 Sierra Mar Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Plump Meyer lemon aromas meet rounded coconut, pineapple cream and honeysuckle on the nose of this bottling from the pioneering Franscioni family. On the palate, it's tightly wound, needing a second to breathe before revealing a sharp lemon peel freshness that cuts through the peachy fruit flavors."
US,87,24,Zinfandel,red,Sobon Estate 2006 Rezerve Zinfandel (Amador County),"Here's an exuberant, country-style Zin that's easy to drink with barbecue. It's enormously fruity in blackberries, currants, mulberries and cinnamon-spicy mocha, with firm tannins that need rich meats to unlock. Drink soon."
US,88,20,Pinot Noir,red,Château Bianca 2005 Cellar Select Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This brings a lot of flavor to the table for its relatively modest price. Round and spicy, it leads with juicy strawberry, cherry and apple pie fruit flavors. Hints of cinnamon wind through the finish, and overall the impression is of a pretty, lively and slightly sweet wine without pretense."
US,89,19,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Groth 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Pretty good price for a bone-dry, crisply elegant Sauvignon Blanc with such good flavor. It's citrusy in limes and grapefruits, with richer notes of figs and melons, and finishes with a scour of spice."
France,87,18,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Tanesse 2014  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux,"This is a firmly tannic wine although with ripe potential. It has a dense character that is good, allowing the fruit to develop. For now, it is dry so give that fruit plenty of time. Drink from 2019."
US,94,72,Chardonnay,white,Small Vines 2014 TBH Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"This wine is crisp, floral and pretty in every way. It's classically structured and graceful, with tart apple notes and stony acidity. It allows the fruit to speak softly and subtly, its lower ripeness detracting from niether flavor nor complexity."
US,91,42,Pinot Noir,red,Panthea 2012 Filigreen Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This is a muscular, full-bodied wine showing a nice mix of savory and fruity flavors. A fantastic lively texture of firm acidity and fine tannins come with a lip-smacking freshness that's hard to ignore. The balance and complexity are very attractive and promise versatility with a wide variety of foods."
US,86,15,Merlot,red,Sagelands 2000 Four Corners Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A round, solidly made wine, with Bing cherry flavors. However, the middle seems to disappear and, as a result, the following tannins feel a bit harsh. —P.G."
US,87,28,Pinot Noir,red,Vista Hills 2011 Treehouse Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The Treehouse spent 18 months in 15% new French oak, and has light flavors of cherry and root beer. The tannins are earthy with astringent, green tea flavors, and a hint of stem in the finish."
US,95,65,Chardonnay,white,Blue Farm 2013 Laceroni Vineyard Estate Farmed Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This wine is the product of farming by Anne Moller-Racke and winemaking by Kenneth Juhasz, the original team behind Donum Estate in Carneros. Here, they've created a gorgeous, elegant expression of lemon zest and pear that harmonizes with stony minerality and brash, bristling acidity that becomes succulent on the palate. Atop it all is a scent of fresh-cut white flowers."
US,94,65,Zinfandel,red,VGS Chateau Potelle 2013 Zinfandel (Mount Veeder),"Perfumed in a wildness of violet and lavender, this beautiful wine is rich and smooth on the palate, both textured and layered. Seductive in its hint of leathery white pepper, it develops brambly blackberry-compote flavors as it opens in the glass."
Italy,86,15,Pinot Grigio,white,Tommasi 2006 Le Rosse Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie),"This is textbook Pinot Grigio Delle Venezie—meaning that fruit is sourced from anywhere within the region—with characteristic aromas of Golden Delicious apple, pear, natural rubber, yellow fruit, honey and a playful touch of citrus zest. Broad dimension and a spicy finish call for a dish like sweet and sour pork."
US,86,32,Pinot Noir,red,Ventana 2012 Estate Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco),"Just a tiny bit of cherry fruit shows on this wine's nose, which is otherwise focused on slate minerality and sagebrush herbals. The palate is soft but not very dynamic, with tight raspberry and flintiness as well as decent acidity and tannins. It finishes quickly."
US,87,28,Pinot Noir,red,Alta Maria 2011 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This Pinot kicks off with a burst of mouthwatering lime acidity, before flavors of cherry, cranberry and cola settle in. The palate finishes richly with some new French oak, making it a great companion with steak."
US,90,50,Pinot Noir,red,Gary Farrell 2005 Ramal Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"The Ramal Vineyard has been source to a fine series of Buena Vista Pinot Noirs. Farrell has captured another interpretation of its terroir, not quite as lush or ripe, but firm in acid-inspired cherries and licorice, with a subtle veneer of smoky oak. It's a dry, crisp young wine, well-structured, a good partner for upscale fare such as lamb chops."
US,88,40,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Ma(i)sonry 2011 Hudson Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This 100% Sauvignon Blanc is made in a ripe style, with refreshing acidity. The complex flavors range from tart gooseberries, limes and kumquats to golden mangoes, with lots of vanilla and sweet toast notes from the new oak."
US,90,32,Red Blend,red,Stevens 2011 StevensFranc Red (Yakima Valley),"A toasty aroma greets you, from 20 months in 70% new French oak. There's plenty of fruit as well, concentrated mulberry and boysenberry annotated with ultradark chocolate. You may lay this one down until 2024."
US,89,29,Merlot,red,Golden Ridge 2012 Estate Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Aromas of baking spices, clove, vanilla and dark fruit lead to a nuanced palate with fruit and barrel flavors and a light grip of tannins. The alcohol shows through a bit but overall it holds it."
US,92,65,Pinot Noir,red,Woodenhead 2012 Buena Tierra Vineyard E Block Clone 115 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Earthy times 10, this unfined, unfiltered wine is subtle and splendid, a study in spiced pomegranate and cola, with a medium build and long finish. Intriguing from start to end, it remains light and vibrant in acidity in the glass, and is a fine example of restraint that doesn't lose flavor."
US,86,32,Syrah,red,Skylite 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of Minnick and Ash Hollow grapes, this is a punchy, high-toned take on Syrah. Particularly attractive are the bright raspberry flavors, peppered with, well, pepper! It's got the kind of verve that you find in a simple Grenache, and finishes light and tangy."
US,92,25,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Vincent Vineyards 2013 Family Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"Enticing aromas of white lilies, nectarines, white peach, honey-lime water and chalky stone hit the nose on this wine from a new vineyard on Highway 154 in the likely-to-be-named Los Olivos District. The palate is creamy down the center but with tangy edges, offering flavors of lime yogurt and pink grapefruit pith."
US,91,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Altvs 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Lush ripe plum, licorice and toasty oak form a triangle of flavor in this blend of 89% Cabernet Sauvignon, with 6% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot. The tannins are undoubtedly present yet soft. Much of the fruit comes from cool Coombsville, with a slight floral characteristic popping up from the midpalate through to the finish."
Italy,88,28,Red Blend,red,Speri 2005  Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso,"Speri's Ripasso has an added layer of spice, vanilla and other oak-generated aromas that distinguish it. There's a juicy core of fruit there too: black cherry, plums and white raisin. Drink this wine with meat-filled ravioli or wild mushrooms."
US,90,125,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Aiken 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"This wine opens with a confectionary nose, slowly unleashing its thick, concentrated richness of dark cherry and cassis on the palate. Between the layers are grippy tannins and shakes of meaty leather and black pepper. This could stand some time in a decanter or swirling in the glass before enjoying."
US,89,29,Red Blend,red,Genoa 2011 Flying Colors Red (Red Mountain),"Labeled a “Super Tuscan-Style Blend” this is 36% Syrah, 45% Sangiovese and 18% Cabernet Sauvignon, all from Red Mountain vineyards. It opens gracefully with pretty raspberry and cherry fruit, then grounds itself in a base of mineral and earth, enlivened with natural acidity."
France,94,150,Chardonnay,white,Thiénot 2004 La Vigne aux Gamins Cuvée de 3435 Chardonnay (Champagne),"From parcels of old vines in the Côte des Blancs, this limited-edition wine is a beautiful Chardonnay. It is finely woven, tightly textured and crisp in apple skin and lemon notes. Concentration from the low-yielding vines gives great depth and the potential to still age well. Drink this exceptional wine from 2017."
US,88,18,Pinot Gris,white,Folie à Deux 2015 Pinot Gris (Sonoma Coast),"This wine has a touch of perceptible sweetness on its tropical nose, yet tastes dry, showing a straightforward approach to this crisp, coastal-grown variety. Apricot, melon and guava wrap around a lightness of body and texture."
US,88,19,Sauvignon Blanc,white,The Girls in the Vineyard 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),"Aromas like fresh honeydew melon and cucumber and flavors suggesting lime and melon ride on a smooth texture with just enough crisp acidity to keep them lively. This wine is pleasantly dry, tangy, and mouthwatering."
France,88,12,Red Blend,red,Domaine d'Arton 2012 La Croix d'Arton Red (Côtes de Gascogne),"With vines in the northeast of the Gers region, this winery produces impressively ripe red wines. This wood-aged and spicy wine is still young and needs time to integrate the wood with the red berry fruits. It does have weight and potential richness, so give it until 2016."
France,88,35,Riesling,white,Wunsch & Mann 2012 Hengst Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"This is a perfumed wine, spicy and textured. It is off-dry which gives it a warm character, apples and white fruits over a rounded texture. It could age another few months and will be more balanced from 2016."
US,92,60,Syrah,red,Tolosa 2011 1772 Syrah (Edna Valley),"This cool-climate wine conveys a super-strong sense of gamy meat, like just-roasted lamb with mint jelly, along with boysenberry, bacon fat, Sichuan pepper and, with patience, prettier violet aromas too. The palate, which walks the balance beam between tannins and acidity, shows bloody meats along with black pepper, boysenberry and earth."
France,95,65,Riesling,white,Domaine Ostertag 2014 Muenchberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Wonderful notions of ivy leaves, citrus peel and conifer greet the nose. The aromatic impression leads onto a slender, dry and fluid palate that still seems tightly coiled and closed. But those subtle aromatic hints and a concentrated, stony palate promise future pleasure. This will blossom into a perfumed marvel. Drink 2019–2030."
US,95,48,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Mark Ryan 2009 Long Haul Merlot-Cabernet Franc-Malbec-Petit Verdot Red (Red Mountain),"A blend of 64% Merlot and 27% Cabernet Franc, with splashes of Malbec and Petit Verdot, this is built for the long haul. Raspberries, cherries and rich chocolate run through this fine-tuned, focused wine. It's deep, elegant and penetrating, with a show-stopping layer of pure mineral that is so powerful the fruit seems soaked in rock."
US,88,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Schug 2013 Heritage Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"A handful of vineyards and additions of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot make up the whole of this wine, a cool-climate style accented in spicy red currant, cherry and woody tannin. With an earthiness of compost and wood, it shows a touch of reduction as it finishes."
US,84,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Oak Knoll District),"There's fine acidity and classic citrus, peach and gooseberry flavors in this Sauvignon Blanc. It's a lovely wine, but it does finishes with a sugary feel."
US,87,55,Pinot Noir,red,Torii Mor 2009 La Colina Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Pretty raspberry fruit scents and flavors dominate, and in the mouth there is a sense of grainy sugars. It has good fruit and ripeness, but still seems a little disjointed. Perhaps more time in the bottle will help sort it out."
US,90,27,Chardonnay,white,Sonoma-Loeb 2015 Sangiacomo Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),"Tart ripe pineapple is given a caramel flip of richness and concentration in this lush integrated wine, that is heady in oak and made in a voluptuous style."
US,90,30,Pinot Noir,red,Easton 2013 Duarte-Georgetown Pinot Noir (Sierra Foothills),"This shows a brownish cast to the garnet color, then reveals wonderful aromas of dried cherry and forest floor. These partner with a firm, dry and appetizing texture and lean but bright cranberry, black tea and cardamom flavors."
US,87,60,Pinot Noir,red,Tudor Wines 2006 Balo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Supple and elegant, with complex flavors of red cherries, cola, anise and smoky vanilla, and a sprinkle of orange zest in the finish. The mouthfeel could be a little firmer, but it's a pleasing Pinot for early drinking."
Italy,87,20,White Blend,white,Tasca d'Almerita 2011 Leone d'Almerita White (Sicilia),"This white blend is the quintessential seafood wine. It offers citrus, stone fruit, crushed mineral and pretty flower nuances."
France,87,23,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Labadie 2013  Médoc,"A fruity wine full of red-berry flavors. This fruitiness is balanced by the light tannins and juicy acidity, producing a wine that is ready to drink."
France,85,22,Pinot Noir,red,Domaines Devillard 2010 Le Renard  (Givry),"Light, bright and fruity, this has soft tannins, plenty of red fruits and balancing acidity. Just dry to finish, it is ready to drink now."
US,90,45,Chardonnay,white,Iron Horse 2006 Rued Clone Chardonnay (Green Valley),"Drier and leaner than the 2005, this is a fancy Chardonnay marked by crisp structure and minerality, rather than extreme lushness. Yet you'll find an overlay of toasty oak and fine flavors of green apples and pineapples that satisfy the fruit tooth. The alcohol is under 14%, and the finish is totally dry."
US,84,22,Syrah,red,RiverAerie 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Sharply defined aromas, with a little funk at the base, lead into tart red fruits and flavors of slightly bitter herbs. The fruit fades quickly, leaving tart flavors of stem and leaf in its wake."
France,94,30,Riesling,white,Biecher & Schaal 2014 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Ripe Mirabelle plums and tart, red apples mix to give a very fruity, appetizing aspect which on the palate is joined by ripe, lemony freshness. This has the balance and drama everyone wishes for in dry Riesling: both generous fruit and ample freshness. Lovely now but with the balance and concentration to last. Lovely Mirabelle finish of immense length. Drink 2016–2026."
US,89,24,Zinfandel,red,Beran 2013 Zinfandel (California),"Deep in color and dramatically smoky in flavor, this full-bodied wine is not at all shy. It tastes fruity, saturated, nicely tannic and very oaky. Charred meat, black pepper and espresso impressions wind through the generous black cherry and blackberry notes."
US,88,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,G. Reedy 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Cherry, cola and cassis form an inviting entry into this wine, its tannins present and persistent on the front of the palate. Secondary notions of dried herb and cedar play into the mix too. The texture softens in the glass and through the finish."
US,93,64,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Prime 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville),"Another fine Cabernet from Prime, following a great 2009. This '10 is perhaps a little off pace from the prior vintage, but is nonetheless impressive. Dry and smoothly tannic, it shows complicated blackberry, blueberry, black currant, sage and mineral flavors. Give it at least six years in a good cellar."
US,87,12,Pinot Grigio,white,Mirassou 2014 Pinot Grigio (California),"A slightly tawny or pink color, characteristic of this variety's grape skins, helps this wine stand out. Aromas like ripe pears and apples lead to vivid, tangy apple and apricot flavors and rather light body."
US,89,34,Pinot Noir,red,Failla 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a fine Pinot for drinking now. It's dry and brisk with coastal acidity, firm tannins and elaborate raspberry, cherry and persimmon flavors, touched by sweet, smoky oak."
US,90,38,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Spicy Vines 2013 Edge Red (Sonoma County),"Velvety blueberry and blackberry notes highlight the moderate structure of this blend of 35% Grenache and 32% Syrah with smaller amounts of Petite Sirah, Carignane and Counoise. Lightly spiced with nutmeg and white pepper, it's balanced and food-friendly, with a soft, round texture."
US,91,50,Pinot Noir,red,Twomey 2008 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A very fine Pinot Noir that shows deep, impressively ripe flavors of raspberry and cherry tart, red currant, licorice and Asian spices, with a rich coating of smoky oak. It's entirely dry, and has a brisk scour of acidity. Seems best now and for the next few years."
US,92,69,Pinot Noir,red,Williams Selyem 2009 Westside Road Neighbors Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A rich, spicy wine, marked by cinnamon and clove-accented raspberries, cherries, cola and mushrooms, as well as a bit of funk. Lovely and complex, it's a blend of various vineyards whose fruit Williams Selyem sources in the northwestern Russian River Valley. Now–2015."
US,93,100,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Spring Mountain Vineyard 2005 Elivette Red (Spring Mountain District),"An impressive young Bordeaux blend, mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, that shows impeccably ripe, clean fruit but also the hard tannins of its famous mountain. Thoroughly dry, its astringency cannot mask an eruption of blackberries and black currants, accented by smoky oak. Give this lovely wine a good five years to begin to mature."
France,90,17,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Castera 2015 Château Bourbon la Chapelle  (Médoc),"The wine comes from a selection of parcels on the Castera estate. With a majority (60%) of Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine is structured and firm and still developing. It has red-berry and black-currant fruit along with plenty of tannic structure. Drink the wine from 2020."
Italy,92,60,Sangiovese,red,Bindi Sergardi 2010 Mocenni 89 Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),"Enticing aromas of fragrant blue flowers, forest floor and perfumed berry lead the nose on this structured wine. The vibrant palate doles out juicy black cherry and crushed raspberry, while accents of vanilla, mocha and licorice add depth. It's nicely balanced, with fresh acidity and firm yet velvety tannins. Drink 2015–2022."
US,84,18,Pinot Noir,red,Angeline 2013 Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma-Mendocino),"With grapes sourced 60% from Sonoma County and 40% from Mendocino County, this is a soft, floral wine with a bright finish. A sister brand made by Martin Ray, it's priced affordably and will offer a pleasant experience for most palates."
US,86,40,Merlot,red,Joullian 2013 Merlot (Carmel Valley),"Sharp Concord grape ripeness meets with a touch of chile pepper and dark tobacco on the nose of this bottling. The palate is redolent with aromatic woods, from cedar to sandalwood, as well as blueberries and dried herbs, but it's a tad thin."
US,90,13,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Steelhead Vineyards 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (North Coast),"Very fresh and vivacious, this light-bodied wine is refreshing. It smells like lemon, grapefruit and kiwi, tastes bright and tangy like lemonade, but is quite dry. The texture is crisp and vital, and keeps the flavors echoing on the finish."
US,85,32,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Danica 1999 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Fruity, silky and simple, with jammy flavors of raspberries and red cherries, tobacco and spice. Feels light and pleasant in the mouth, but could use more stuffing."
US,85,48,Pinot Noir,red,Double Bond 2008 Wolff Vineyard Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"A rugged, somewhat rustic wine, with a scoury mouthfeel. It's a little on the sweet side. Tastes like a raspberry, roasted almond and nougat candy bar."
US,83,36,Chardonnay,white,Unionville 2010 Unionville Home Single Vineyard Estate Bottled Chardonnay (New Jersey),"Quite savory on the nose and palate, with notes of cooked apple, lemon and peach purée. This is judiciously oaked with bright, lemon-lime acidity that livens up the palate."
US,92,54,Red Blend,red,Blackbird Vineyards 2014 Arise Proprietary Red (Napa Valley),"This blends 38% Merlot with 32% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Cabernet Franc. Together these find a healthy companionship of wood, cedar, currant and dried herb, allowing the two Cabernets to speak loudest. Lightly spicy nutmeg and clove linger around well-defined layers of cherry and vanilla."
France,91,30,Pinot Gris,white,Joseph Cattin 2013 Hatschbourg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"An off-dry character sets the scene for this concentrated, already balanced wine. The Hatschbourg vineyard in the southern Alsace village of Voegtlinshoffen is composed of clay and chalk soil on a southeast-facing slope. It gives exceptional ripeness, as here, a warm and full-bodied wine with great swathes of fruitiness. Drink from 2017."
Italy,88,13,Sangiovese,red,Melini 2011 Governo All'Uso Toscano  (Chianti),"This is a special wine that represents an antique and almost nonexistent winemaking practice in Tuscany today. A portion of the Sangiovese grapes are air dried, and the wine is refermented on the dried grapes. As result, it shows great intensity and dried aromas of cassis, prune and tobacco. Bright acidity pulls it together."
US,87,18,Pinot Noir,red,Santa Barbara Winery 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Gravel, dark red berries and a raw beef character show on the nose of this accessibly priced wine. The palate offers beet and dark cranberry juice flavors, along with black sage and camphor. Still tightly wound, it will get better with patience."
US,85,12,Merlot,red,Cupcake 2014 Merlot (Central Coast),"Plum aromas meet dried oregano, graphite and bell pepper touches on the nose of this bottling. Light strawberry flavors are accented with an iron-tinged character and more bell pepper on the palate."
US,83,8,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Oak Grove 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"This is dry, with scouring tannins and some twiggy, stalky bitterness. It has just enough blackberry flavor to get by. For the price, it's fine for big parties."
US,93,60,Syrah,red,Rasa 2009 Occam's Razor Block Ten Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Sourced from the Seven Hills vineyard, this deep and dark Syrah offers rich black-cherry and cassis flavors. The palate is dense and complex, with beautifully integrated charcoal, gravel, earth and espresso components."
US,87,25,Pinot Noir,red,Santa Barbara Winery 2009 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Here's a pretty Pinot, direct and appealing for its range of fruit. Shows raspberry, cherry and persimmon flavors, uplifted by bright acidity. Drink it now."
US,92,50,Chardonnay,white,Lutum 2014 Durell Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"This wine smacks you in the face first thing, demanding attention, before settling into mouthwateringly succulent layers of Asian pear, graham cracker and Nilla wafer. An underbelly of oak supports the fruit, remaining subtle and providing structure. The acidity shines most on the finish, inviting further exploration."
France,89,32,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine Seguin 2007  Pouilly-Fumé,"Great wafts of white currants come from this delicious—but definitely too young—wine. It is full of flavor, fruity and ripe. There's a good structure from green apple skins and tight acidity. Give it another year."
US,88,20,Chardonnay,white,Lava Cap 2014 Reserve Estate Bottled Chardonnay (El Dorado),"Bold flavors and plenty of creamy texture make this full-bodied wine seem big and mouth-filling. It offers nice lemon and butter aromas, ripe pear and spicy nutmeg flavors along with a smoky overtone that lasts from the aroma to the finish."
US,87,50,Merlot,red,Medlock Ames 2013 Heritage Merlot (Alexander Valley),"Made with 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Malbec and 1% Petit Verdot, this estate-grown wine is made in small lots and offers aromas of baked bread and red fruit from the get-go. The Cabernet shows its presence, and there's a wealth of bitter, leathery tannin offset by soft, approachable oak."
US,87,25,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Spottswoode 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"The bouquet is a bit flat at first, offering nothing more than white stone fruits and pear. Green melon is amplified by a dose of white pepper on the palate, while the finish is layered and solid; it's the best part of the wine by far."
US,91,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Soos Creek 2013 Sundance Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is half Merlot, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. High-toned aromas of baking spice, herb, dark chocolate and dark cherry are followed by luscious ripe red and black-fruit flavors. It's irresistible in its appeal."
France,87,40,Chardonnay,white,Clos des Rocs 2013 Les Pierrottes  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"This wine is lean, with a severe character that gives tightness to the fruit. It's very mineral in character, full of acidity and just hinting at spice. Drink this nervy wine from 2016."
US,83,15,Pinot Gris,white,Redgate 2013 Estate Grown Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"This sour, beery wine is for those who like a high acid flush with their meal. The very tart flavors focus on lemon and green apple."
US,93,55,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Davies 2014 jd Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"From the producer's mountain estate, and blended with 7% Malbec, this wine is chalky in blue fruit, with a hearty back-palate of tannin. The grit softens in the glass, revealing nuanced elegance and shades of nutmeg, cherry and blueberry brightness."
Italy,92,45,Red Blend,red,Lungarotti 2008 Vigna Monticchio Red (Torgiano Rosso Riserva),"This iconic bottling, a blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Canaiolo, features aromas of ripe black fruit, violet, grilled herb, toast and espresso. The palate delivers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, vanilla and mocha alongside firm but refined tannins. It closes on a licorice note. Drink 2015–2023."
France,89,39,Chardonnay,white,Vincent 2013 Cuvée Marie-Antoinette  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"This delicious, ripe and juicy wine is full of rich yellow fruits and refreshing balancing acidity. It has a crisp, mineral side to it, with a tangy lemon zest flavor. It's an attractive wine that's just ready to drink now."
US,99,250,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Alpha Omega 2012 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),"Juicy and seductively smooth, this blockbuster beauty from the revered vineyard site is big, bold and intense, with granular tannins and a grip of integrated French oak. Its bright cassis, lavender, Tahitian vanilla and dried herb flavors are irresistible right out the gate. Ripe and rewarding, it's one to remember."
France,93,65,Chardonnay,white,Albert Bichot 2005 Domaine Long-Depaquit Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),"This is pure mineral, chalk and lean austerity initially, but opens up with apples,  lime and green plums. It is intense, concentrated and structured; needs time. Wait 4–5 years."
US,83,10,Riesling,white,Kendall-Jackson 2006 Vintner's Reserve Riesling (California),"Frankly sweet, this Riesling, made only from cool coastal grapes, benefits from crisp acidity. The tartness balances the sugary peach, citrus and honeysuckle flavors."
US,89,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Grgich Hills 2011 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a classic Napa Valley floor Cabernet, enhanced with handfuls of Petit Verdot and Merlot. Dusty in red currant and herb, it offers mellowed tannins and a peppery underbelly."
US,87,20,Red Blend,red,Elevation Cellars 2010 Jammin' Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The 2010 Jammin' Red is an ambitious blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Cab Franc and a bit of Tempranillo. Sweet cherry fruit is the focus, leaving a trail of pretty, hard candy flavor as it rolls across the tongue. The tannins are astringent, a bit chalky, and the finish does a quick fade."
Italy,90,15,Pinot Grigio,white,Alois Lageder 1999 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),"More Pinot Grigios should taste like this. A rich pear-like nose is followed by crisp acidity, a medium body and a viscous mouthfeel. The finish is long and redolent of pears and citrus. And all for $15!"
US,87,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Browne Family Vineyards 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine seems a bit muddled, with aromas of cranberries, dried herbs, vanilla, cashews and barrel spices struggling to get to the surface. The palate is medium bodied with tart fruit flavors and blocky tannins, with the concentration not seeming to all be there."
Italy,88,25,Red Blend,red,Le Bertille 2010  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,"A little air unlocks aromas of underbrush, scorched earth, blue flower, toasted oak and mature berry. On the firm palate, notes of espresso and licorice add some depth to the core of dried black cherry while grippy, close-grained tannins provide support."
US,88,50,Pinot Noir,red,Clos La Chance 2013 Erwin Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Notes of cinnamon and peppercorns adds complexity to the cranberry-pomegranate fruit and slate minerality on the nose of this single-vineyard expression. It's more reserved in its palate, which offers cranberry tang with an herbal sagebrush quality, proving a reliable, straightforward take on the grape."
US,89,46,Chardonnay,white,Williams Selyem 2005 Hawk Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This hugely ripe Chardonnay is just a little too big for absolute balance. Any more powerful, and it would be over the line. As it is, it flirts with it, with gobs of jammy apricots, yellow pears, citrine and Meyer lemondrop, as well as barrel influences ranging from creamy lees to buttered toast, roasted hazelnuts and smoky honey. The alcohol is over 15%."
US,93,60,Pinot Noir,red,Boekenoogen 2014 Garrett's Vineyard Dryland Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is the annual release of a small, isolated vineyard block that's dry-farmed and named for the winemaker. The unctuous bottling shows luxurious aromas of baked black cherries, cinnamon, clove, cream and a touch of iron. The rich dark red-fruit flavors show on the sip, where the surrounding chaparral herbs invade the palate, offering dried sagebrush, eucalyptus and a wild mint sensation that last deep into the finish."
France,89,30,Chardonnay,white,Pascal Bouchard 2008 Les Vieilles Vignes Montmains Premier Cru  (Chablis),"Toasty wine, maybe over-toasty, giving a buttery malolactic feel. Its acidity and its freshness are both enveloped in a more opulent embrace."
France,85,18,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Bréhat 2013  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"With some attractive tannins and strawberry fruits, this wine has kept its light character. It is developing well into an attractively fruity wine that will be ready from the end of 2016. This is part of a larger estate, Château Haut Rocher, across the line from Castillon in Saint-Émilion. It has been in the family since the 17th century. Jérôme et Béatrice de Monteil took over both properties for the family in 2010."
US,84,27,Merlot,red,Clos Pegase 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Shows some vegetal unripeness throughout, along with cherry and currant flavors enhanced with the usual smoky oak. A disappointment."
Italy,88,104,Sangiovese,red,Poggio Antico 2010 Altero  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Oak, espresso and toast aromas jump out of the glass. The tightly wound palate delivers plum cake, roasted coffee bean, oak extract, licorice, a confectionary note and licorice but not much fruit richness. Raspy wood tannins provide the framework."
US,92,65,Pinot Noir,red,Testarossa 2015 Sanford & Benedict Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Deep black cherry, sarsaparilla and vanilla show on the full and hearty nose of this bottling from the historic vineyard that was planted in the 1970s. It's tightly woven on the palate, with earthy spice and dark red fruits. The acidity holds crisp deep into the finish."
US,91,38,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,The Withers Winery 2013 Ruben Red (El Dorado),"This is a well-balanced, handsomely composed wine that is big in flavor and full in body. The aromas are spicy like black pepper and cardamom, the flavors are meaty, peppery, smoky and berry-like, for a great taste experience that goes way beyond the usual. It's made mostly from Mourvèdre grapes, with Syrah and Grenache in supporting roles."
Italy,92,37,Red Blend,red,Castello Banfi 2006 Cum Laude Red (Toscana),"Castello Banfi's delicious Cum Laude is a super Tuscan blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sangiovese and Syrah that opens with rich aromas of black fruit and chocolate fudge. The 30% Cabernet Sauvignon component adds background notes of exotic spice, moist tobacco and firm tannins."
US,81,29,Zinfandel,red,Beaver Creek 2007 Zinfandel (Lake County),"Soft, simple and sweet, with jellied raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. Tastes like an inferior dessert wine."
US,87,11,Chardonnay,white,Snoqualmie 2000 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Tasty fresh fruit, leaning toward grapefruit and pineapple, peach and lemon. Zesty and forward, it refreshes rather than fatigues the palate, and is perfect for sipping on a spring afternoon. Best Buy."
US,88,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Broadside 2012 Margarita Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"This stylish and well-priced wine from Brian and Stephanie Terrizzi offers aromas of grape juice, shattered slate, charcoal ash and a sharp, peppery spice. The blackberry juice flavors are broad, approachable and pleasantly airy on the palate, but quickly given complexity with coyote-brush woodiness, iron shavings and a solid tannic grip."
US,89,20,Chardonnay,white,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2013 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"While stridently oak driven, this Chardonnay keenly maintains a core of fresh pear and apple flavor amidst layers of spice and caramel. It's supple and silky in texture, finishing on a lingering kiss of vanilla cream."
US,88,20,Chardonnay,white,MacMurray Estate Vineyards 2015 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Muted aromatics slowly reveal a full-bodied gritty texture of minerality that becomes crisp in the glass. Floral apple blossom, green apple and vanilla combine for a juicy palate of fruit and succulence."
US,88,24,Pinot Noir,red,Arcane Cellars 2007 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"It's toasty and lush with the scents and flavors of roasted walnuts and butterscotch; not a bad thing by any means. Under the sweet oak are flavors of berry, tart and fresh as if just-picked. This is a thoroughly delightful bottle and a rare find at this price—a Pinot Noir that can be enjoyed immediately but should cellar well for up to a decade."
US,87,32,Syrah,red,Yorba 2008 Shake Ridge Vineyards Syrah (Amador County),"Earthy with an expansive mouthfeel, this brambly, savory Syrah reveals hints of herb and deep, dark black fruit. It comes from a great vineyard site and is structured to age; give it air before enjoying with a proper cassoulet."
Italy,95,88,White Blend,white,Lis Neris 2007 Tal Lùc White (Friuli),"Tal Lùc comes in an elegant little bottle that beautifully sets the stage for the fabulous dessert wine to follow. The color is deeply golden and saturated and aromas include toasted almond, dried yellow rose, candied fruit and apricot. The creamy texture would pair with something different than dessert, say a delicate sliver of duck liver pâté."
France,84,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Pey la Tour 2011  Bordeaux,"Structure keeps this firm, dry wine solidly closed. It is tightly wound at this stage, only hinting at a brighter, fruity future. Drink after 2015."
France,86,16,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château La Mothe du Barry 2010  Bordeaux Supérieur,"This soft, fruity wine is lined with acidity and gentle tannins. It has a ripe red-berry flavor, with a touch of cherry and some dryness toward the finish. Not for long-term aging."
France,87,25,Pinot Gris,white,Helfrich 2011 Steinklotz Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Light and attractively spicy, the wine is off dry, with a touch of honey, apricots and dried fruits. The texture, soft and tangy, is peppery while the acidity is already well integrated. It's an attractive, ready to drink wine."
US,86,14,Syrah,red,Sawtooth 2011 Estate Grown Syrah,"Light in style, this is a pleasant, varietally correct wine with notes of violets, game and lemon playing off a soft, rounded mouthfeel and grainy tannins."
France,85,10,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Michel Picard 2007 Red (Côtes du Rhône),"On the lighter side of the Côtes du Rhône spectrum, with a slightly briary note to the cherry fruit. Turns more olivaceous on the silky-textured finish. Drink now."
France,88,12,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Dourthe 2015 La Grande Cuvée  (Bordeaux Blanc),"Dourthe's 100% Sauvignon Blanc is lively and crisp—a light, bright wine. With its strong citrus flavors, lemon and tangerine, touched by spice, it is balanced and fruity. The texture gives a herbal edge that is attractive and refreshing."
US,90,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Vellum 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon with a handful of Merlot and Petit Verdot, this wine is on the cooler-climate side of the sensory equation, a note of pencil and olive here, a bit of juicy cranberry there. Chalky tannins complete the picture, the wine balanced and medium to light in weight."
US,84,7,Merlot,red,Pine & Post 2011 Merlot (Washington),"Light in color and style, this wine seems more similar to a Pinot Noir than a Merlot. There's no apparent oak influence to interfere with the notes of ash, red currant, saline and bell pepper that are supported by a light grip of tannins."
France,87,46,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Jessiaume 2009 Les Ecusseaux Premier Cru  (Auxey-Duresses),"Wood-influenced aromas set the scene, with the wine's toast character partnered with ripe red fruits and taut acidity. It needs at least three years to balance out."
US,93,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Freemark Abbey 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Shows all the hallmarks of an important young Napa Cabernet. Bone dry and quite hard in tannins, it's immensely concentrated in blackberries, black currants, cassis and fine, smoky new oak. Possesses that elusive quality of dramatic terroir, a real sense of place. Very fine young wine that needs time. Cellar until at least 2015."
France,86,27,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Sipp-Mack 2013 Tradition Pinot Noir (Alsace),"Simple, but up-front strawberry fruit reigns on nose and palate of this very light-bodied red. The palate is soft, easy, dry and fresh and would take very well to chilling on a warm day."
Italy,85,18,Red Blend,red,Aldegheri 2005 Il Groto Red (Rosso del Veronese),"This is a thin and easy blend of Corvina, Rondinella, Croatina and Dindarella with sweet aromas of blueberry, forest floor, bramble and grassy notes that make a good companion to informal meals at home. The wine is tart and slightly bitter with straightforward berry favors."
US,90,50,Pinot Noir,red,Erath 2006 Tuenge Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"It's pronounced tung-GEE and was formerly known as Chehalem Mountain vineyards. As is often the case with this AVA, it has substantial tannins and a firm, compact structure that bodes well for cellaring. The fruit mixes cherry, pomegranate and hints of banana, while the barrel flavors add some toast and butter."
US,90,22,Zinfandel,red,Chacewater 2014 Made With Organically Grown Grapes Zinfandel (Sierra Foothills),"A good example of the late-harvest approach, this indulgent wine has strawberry syrup aromas, crushed raspberry and blackberry flavors, great concentration and a high level of ripeness. Drink it in lieu of dessert."
US,92,40,Pinot Noir,red,Chamisal Vineyards 2015 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"From one of the larger estates in the Edna Valley, this wine has sweet-smelling plum, cherry candy and grenadine aromas. The palate is front-loaded with sagebrush, thyme, dried lavender and rosemary notes, while a hibiscus flavor unfolds in the background."
Italy,85,35,Red Blend,red,Aia Vecchia 2011 Sor Ugo  (Bolgheri Superiore),"Aromas of spiced plum and exotic spice lead the nose on this robust wine. On the palate, scorching alcohol overwhelms dried black cherry and licorice, throwing the wine completely off balance. Astringent tannins and a green note of powdered sage create an extremely bitter finish."
US,84,13,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Kenwood 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"Nice and clean, but the sweetness makes it almost a dessert wine. The sugary orange and peach flavors are balanced with good acidity."
US,93,40,Pinot Noir,red,La Crema 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine is made in decent quantities, enough to hopefully find, and that's good news, given its quality for the price. Juicy, spicy and just the right amount of herbal, it has sizzling acidity that livens and refreshens the palate, dotted in chocolate-covered cherry, plum and clove."
US,88,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Haak 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Texas High Plains),"Aromas of black fruit, cinnamon and tobacco are congenial on the nose. The palate is velvety, with flavors of blackberry and cedar backed by nutmeg, clove and ashy tannins. Currant and cedar notes turn spicy on the finish. Pair with game meats."
France,92,40,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Simon 2010 Cuvée Exceptionelle  (Sauternes),"Maturity comes slowly to a Sauternes, but this wine is almost there. Its fine sweetness is balanced by a lemon curd-like acidity while its rich botrytis is finely integrated with the opulent texture. Drink now."
US,84,18,Chardonnay,white,La Crema 2010 Chardonnay (Monterey),"This has flavors of pineapple, orange and buttered toast, with lots of brisk acidity. It offers the oaky creaminess that many Americans love."
Italy,91,64,Red Blend,red,Tenuta San Leonardo 2003 San Leonardo Red (Vigneti delle Dolomiti),"This was a hot vintage, but this beautifully elegant blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot boasts enormous purity of fruit and deep layers of penetration and intensity. It is a more fruit-forward version of the wine, but it does offer drying minerals and bright fruit flavors with tight tannins to keep it balanced."
US,90,30,Riesling,white,Castel Grisch 2013 Ice Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Dusty pollen notes lend complexity to this gorgeously floral, fruity nectar made from naturally frozen grapes. Brimming with luscious stone fruit flavors yet marked by a cool strike of lemon-lime acidity, it's impeccably balanced. The finish is long and silken."
US,90,55,Zinfandel,red,Howell Mountain Vineyards 2013 Beatty Ranch Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"This is a concentrated, dark and brooding wine from the producer's well-known property, sparkling in acidity despite its intensity of weight and length. Blackberry and nutmeg sit atop a soft integration of tannin and oak. Drink now through 2020."
Italy,86,12,Pinot Grigio,white,Paladin 2007 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie),"Here is a fresh and straightforward expression of Pinot Grigio with vibrant notes of exotic fruit, papaya and pear. In the mouth, the wine tastes lean, crisp and very cooling."
US,84,6,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Leaping Horse 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Case production was 46,000 and every bottle will sell because it's a good wine at a great price. Nothing terribly complicated, but dry, full-bodied and fruity."
US,83,15,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Jones of Washington 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Wahluke Slope),"From estate-grown fruit, this adds Merlot, Sangiovese and Syrah to the Cab. The net result is a diffuse wine with no varietal character. Tannins are hard and bitter, and the fruit seems to be hiding."
US,90,125,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Vineyard 511 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"Given more than two years in all-French oak, this 100% Cabernet impresses in balancing juicy red currant and cherry fruit against more savory tannin and herb. Structured, it should gain traction and mellow in severity through 2020–2025."
US,93,47,Zinfandel,red,Carlisle 2014 Montafi Ranch Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"From a ranch planted originally in 1926 this is a knockout wine, exotically spiced and nuanced in pepper, cinnamon and a distinction of sandalwood. High-toned fruit provides a lift to the lushness that wants to dominate, but never does, allowing the tangy orange and blackberry to speak quietly and clearly."
France,91,22,Riesling,white,Trimbach 2013 Riesling (Alsace),"While this has a tight corset of freshness and structure, expressive notes of peach show their exuberance. The palate again reveals tautness, shot through with lemon purity while the peach delightfully plays around them."
US,84,75,Chardonnay,white,Keller Estate 2006 Precioso Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Tastes like there's a great deal of residual sugar left over, giving the wine an overtly sugary sweetness that's almost like Sauternes."
US,89,34,Syrah,red,àMaurice 2009 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Peppery and trending toward stemmy flavors, this has a phenolic bite. The brambly berry fruit runs quickly into a slightly warm finish."
France,87,30,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Peyfaures 2010 Dame de Coeur  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"Hugely ripe Merlot is at the core of this rich wine. It is opulent, rounded and packed with dark plum-juice flavors. It verges on too much, too rich and too generous. What redeems it is the Bordeaux structure and final dry aftertaste."
France,90,30,Pinot Gris,white,Joseph Cattin 2014 Hatschbourg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"The nose is subdued but opens into juicy ripe pear fruit with a gentle, balanced sweetness. The body is pliable and fluid, unobtrusive and balmy, yet serious. It achieves a wonderful balance with an off-dry finish."
Italy,93,50,Sangiovese,red,Col di Lamo 2010  Brunello di Montalcino,"The nose is still a bit closed but eventually reveals leather, game, berry and forest floor. The palate is more expressive, delivering concentrated wild cherry, black raspberry, cooking spice, savory herb and anise. A backbone of firm but polished tannins and fresh acidity provides the framework. Drink 2020–2030."
US,82,14,Chardonnay,white,Hargrave 1998 Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),"This wine shows some of the less appealing aspects of American oak: overt spice and vanilla flavors and a slick, oily mouthfeel."
US,92,48,Pinot Noir,red,Brick House 2014 Cuvée du Tonnelier Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"What differentiates this offering is the block selection—all Pommard clone—and a higher (30%) proportion of new cooperage. Warm and generous fruit flavors bring strawberry and cherry in a lushly textured wine that refreshes as it delights. The finish adds extended notes of lemon custard, orange flan and a lick of caramel."
US,87,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Basel Cellars 2008 Pheasant Run Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Tart, with brambly berry fruit, and even a bit of apricot. This was a cool year in Walla Walla, and the fruit flavors reflect that."
France,91,36,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Matthias et Emile Roblin 2013 Grande Côte de la Vallée  (Sancerre),"This is a structured wine with layers of tannins as well as ripe red plum skin fruit flavors. It is a wine for aging, which would bring out a rich texture as well as intense acidity. It should not be drunk before 2017."
US,90,16,Riesling,white,Knapp 2014 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Citrus blossoms and lime zest perfume this fragrant little showstopper. Dry in style, it's a spry, delicately-framed wine, yet lusciously concentrated in peach and melon flavors. Streaks of lemon-lime acidity catapult a long, penetrating finish."
France,90,65,Chardonnay,white,Lallier NV Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"With 60% of the Chardonnay in this wine coming from the vineyards of the Montagne de Reims, it is no surprise that it is rich and full in the mouth. The wine has weight along with a crisp minerality. Taut and tense, the aftertaste suggests that the wine will improve in bottle for a few months."
US,93,39,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Piocho 2011 Reserve Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"This is a cohesive and well-integrated blend of 34% Cabernet Franc, 29% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 9% Petit Verdot and 8% Malbec. It offers blackberry, black currant, cedar, toasty oak, violets, roast beef, black pepper and pencil lead on the nose. The well-hewn palate combines pepper and blackberry at the tip of the sip, followed by oaky vanilla and a touch of pine. it's very well focused."
US,85,18,Red Blend,red,The Crusher 2011 Sugar Beet Ranch Red (Clarksburg),"A meaty and oaky red blend of mostly Tempranillo (64%), with smaller amounts of Petite Sirah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, The Crusher sources grapes from a relatively cool area in Clarksburg. Fruity with cinnamon layers, this wine would pair well with hamburgers or pizza."
Italy,91,25,Pinot Grigio,white,Elena Walch 2015 Castel Ringberg Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),"White spring blossom, orchard fruit and a whiff of Alpine herb come together on this delicious, structured white. The juicy, full-bodied palate offers white peach, mature pear and tangerine alongside bright acidity that lifts the creamy flavors. A precise mineral note closes the lingering finish and lends finesse."
US,88,52,Merlot,red,Bravante 2007 Estate Merlot (Howell Mountain),"This Merlot is very tannic now, which makes it hard to drink. There are considerable cherry, berry, currant, mineral and herb flavors, but they're buried under a ton of astringency. You're best off giving the wine a good four years in the cellar to let it age it a bit."
Italy,85,40,Red Blend,red,Luigi Righetti 2011 Capitel de Roari  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),This opens with unusual charred aromas and whiffs of resin. The palate retains the same burnt sensations alongside notes of roasted coffee bean and bitter walnut husk. It lacks fruit richness and ends on an astringent note that dries out the mouth.
US,84,14,Red Blend,red,Red Rock 2010 Reserve Winemaker's Red (California),"A big, sweet wine, heavy in the mouth, with fabulously ripe blackberry, cherry and chocolate flavors. Bring on the lasagna and cheeseburgers. The blend is Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah."
US,91,20,Pinot Gris,white,Soléna 2015 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Soléna really ups their PG game with this latest vintage, a super rich, succulent effort that is packed to the core with fresh pear fruit flavors. Light touches of cinnamon, and a sense of sweetness from ripe fruit, not residual sugar, keep the flavors expanding through a lush and creamy finish."
US,92,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Ridge 2011 Monte Bello Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Ridge's historic Monte Bello estate produces black tobacco, wet slate, chalk and blueberry jam aromas in this vintage. The wine, which gets support from 14% Merlot-3% Petite Verdot-1% Cabernet Franc, is not very dense and even racy on the palate, with violet, cola, tart cranberry and darker fruit as well."
US,93,45,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Ilsley 2004 Seis Primas Red (Stags Leap District),"An unusual blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec, with a splash of Merlot, this is a beautiful wine. It's also a young one, brimming with tight, youthful tannins that give it a lockdown astringency. But the cassis, cherry liqueur and cedar flavors are impressively deep and complex, and should ride out six to eight years of cellaring."
US,86,28,Pinot Noir,red,Evening Land 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The most widely available bottling from Evening Land, this has a strong streak of earth and bark, with somewhat flat-tasting fruit flavors of black cherry cola. It finishes earthy and tannic, with a rough edge that may smooth out with additional bottle age."
US,96,65,Chardonnay,white,Ramey 2012 Hyde Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),"This longstanding collaboration between vintner and grower reflects years of mutual understanding and respect. The wine offers pretty orange blossom and lemon verbena aromas that wrap around a composed, well-integrated and mineral-laden body. Voluptuous, the wine is also well-balanced, finishing in bright acidity. It is deliciously good."
US,95,50,Chardonnay,white,Résonance 2015 Hyland Vineyard Chardonnay (McMinnville),"If anyone can elevate Oregon's already excellent Chardonnays to the next level, it's Jacques Lardière, who makes Résonance for Louis Jadot after four decades at their winery in Burgundy. This nutty toasty chiseled wine has impeccable breeding, power and elegance. White peach, pear and apple fruit is wrapped in lush barrel flavors of caramel, buttered toast and vanilla wafer, with firm acids for a foundation. Drink now and on through 2025."
US,90,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Stewart 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A little ungainly now, with stiff tannins and lots of fresh, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit colliding with unintegrated oak notes. All the parts are there, but they need until 2019–2020 to meld."
France,85,63,Pinot Noir,red,Labouré-Roi 2014  Chambolle-Musigny,This wine is soft and rather shapeless. It has red fruits and a gentle texture while lacking in depth. It's a simple wine that will develop quickly.
US,89,45,Red Blend,red,Giornata 2012 Gemellaia Red (Paso Robles),"This is an ambitious, Super Tuscan-esque blend of 60% Sangiovese, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon 10% and Petit Verdot. It shows woody cedar, violet flowers and dense purple fruit on the nose. Tongue-tingling acidity enlivens the palate, which offers good tension between blackberry juice and tarry grip."
US,86,35,Pinot Noir,red,Luminous Hills 2009 Lux Pinot Noir,"Already showing some bricking around the rim, this estate-grown Pinot Noir mixes spicy strawberry and some residual fermentation flavors of biscuit and blood. Difficult to know how this one is going to age."
Italy,89,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Terre del Marchesato 2011 Il Tarabuso Cabernet Sauvignon (Toscana),"This brooding wine opens with aromas of mature blue and black fruit, allspice, charred earth and whiff of game. The palate delivers spiced blueberry, blackberry, ground pepper, licorice and tobacco alongside assertive tannins."
US,87,22,Merlot,red,Happy Canyon Vineyard 2010 Merlot (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"A blend containing the major Bordeaux varieties, this has lots of acidity and tannins, plus flavors of sweet cherries, blackberries and pepper. Drink now with robust fare, like Santa Maria barbecue."
US,84,20,Pinot Noir,red,Beringer 2006 Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"The grapes come from the cooler Oak Knoll area of Napa Valley, yet this wine is very soft and melted, without much acidity to provoke and enliven the ripe cherry, vanilla and sassafras flavors. It does show Pinot's silkiness, and is easy to drink."
US,87,28,Syrah,red,DiStefano 2008 R Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Quite dry on the palate, this seems less ripe than the previous vintage. The opening flavors are dominated by earth and stem—rather than fruit—followed by notes of baking spice, coconut and caramel."
US,91,45,Zinfandel,red,Storybook Mountain 2008 Eastern Exposures Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"A first rate Zinfandel, as rich as they come, brimming with intense mountain fruit flavors of blackberries, black currants and cola, with Zin's black pepper and a savory taste of grilled Canadian bacon. Lush, smooth and tannic, it's a beautiful wine to drink now with beef stew or even a coq au vin-style dish."
Italy,87,25,Red Blend,red,Madonna Alta 2004  Montefalco Rosso,"This is an easy wine to drink with a soft, generous personality and interesting aromas of red berry fruit backed by dusty minerals and spice. It would pair well with pasta, pork and veal thanks to its no-fuss approach and natural succulence."
US,90,25,Red Blend,red,Beast 2013 Wildebeest Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is principally Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc along with bits of Malbec, Grenache and Merlot. Aromas of green garden herbs and earthy funk are followed by soft, elegant earth and dark fruit flavors that bring appeal and intrigue."
US,85,14,Riesling,white,Keuka Spring 2009 Semi Sweet Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Mulled apple cider, ginger and candied orange peel aromas perfume this easy-drinking Riesling. Tart acidity and a kick of apple pie spice meld playfully with the semisweet palate. A nice wine for casual autumn entertaining."
US,92,18,Pinot Noir,red,Schug 1998 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Cherry-berry fruit, spice, a velvety texture and a long finish make for a lovely wine, soft and limpid, but with underlying power. The tannins are as light as air, but somehow substantial anyway. The framework is exceptional. You'll be smacking your lips over this beauty."
US,91,27,Chardonnay,white,Cali 351 2006 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"This is a classy Chardonnay. Grown 1,200 feet above Calistoga and fairly well-oaked in new barrels, it's rich and complex, with flavors of grilled tropical fruits and toasted meringue. The structure is greatly improved by a crisp, minerally edge of acidity."
US,90,19,Zinfandel,red,Rosenblum 1998 Rockpile Road Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Old vine clone, with brambly, gamy notes throughout. Lifts up the palate with lively, bright flavors. Good concentration, balance and follow-through."
US,90,44,Pinot Noir,red,Dutton-Goldfield 2015 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine hails from a variety of Dutton family vineyards, many of them popular vineyard designates of their own. Together they show a deftness of blending, offering bright acidity within a lighthearted context of licorice and wild strawberry. The juicy core is further embellished in huckleberry and blueberry, finishing in a mild hit of nutmeg."
US,90,50,Chardonnay,white,Corley Reserve 2012 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Oak Knoll District),"Ripe apricot, mango and peach flavors mark this flashy Chardonnay. It's dry and oaky, with brisk acidity and a creamy mouthfeel. Don't drink it too cold."
US,88,20,Syrah,red,Stickybeak 2008 Syrah (Napa County),"This generous Syrah is reminiscent of a nice, rich Provençal wine. It's soft and spicy and fruity, with a good grip of tannin. The black raspberry, mulberry and cherry flavors are dusted with cinnamon and clove, and you'll find a coating of sweet, smoky oak. The vineyard is on Atlas Peak."
US,87,11,Merlot,red,Lyeth 2006 L de Lyeth Merlot (Sonoma County),"This Merlot over-delivers for the everyday price. It's bone dry and classically structured, with rich, ripe tannins and mouthwatering acidity framing flavors of cherries, red and black currants, dusty spices and cedar. Sommeliers, scoop this one up. More than 15,000 cases produced."
US,84,32,Chardonnay,white,Sunstone 2008 Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"Despite oak-infused pineapple and mango flavors this Chardonnay is a bit brittle and tart, with an acidic sharpness all the way through. Drink up."
France,90,22,Riesling,white,Vieil Armand 2009 Château Ollwiller Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Riesling that is just becoming mature is the foundation of this perfumed, white fruit and complex wine. Dried apricot and spice cake flavors give the wine richness and balance the fruitiness that is now maturing. Drink this fine wine now."
US,94,125,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,David Arthur 2009 Old Vine Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is built to impress through its sheer power. With a little Petit Verdot blended in, which adds a floral character, it's marked by an intense flavor of ripe wild blackberries, with a dried berry quality that's suggestive of currants and a liqueur fullness, courtesy of the high alcohol. The French oak is a full 100% new, and is in keeping with the wine's volume. So rich and tannic now, it's barely drinkable. Give it at least 6–8 years in a good cellar and see what happens."
US,95,105,Pinot Noir,red,Williams Selyem 2013 Williams Selyem Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"From the hillsides of Westside Road, a goldmine of goodness, this estate-driven wine is packed with cinnamon, black-cherry clafouti and crushed rose petals. Soft and seductively silky on the palate, it's bright and deceptively light, a symphony of pomegranate, cardamon and blood orange that lingers on the finish."
France,89,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Rousset-Caillau 2010 Cuvée Jean  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"The top wine from this estate is this release from the powerful 2010 vintage. It has a dense structure, dark tannins and rich texture. Ripe black plum and dark fig flavors along with the dry core means the wine is still developing. Drink from 2017."
France,91,45,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Jessiaume 2015 Les Cents Vignes Premier Cru  (Beaune),"With vines forming part of the 22-acre Jessiaume estate, this vineyard—one of the better known of the Beaune premiers crus—has produced a fine, rich wine in this vintage. Although there is plenty of young wood, the fruit is so rich and generous, with such fine potential. Give this opulent wine until 2022."
France,90,26,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Liversan 2012  Haut-Médoc,"Liversan makes a serious style of wine from its 125-acre vineyard, situated in the north of the Haut-Médoc. Dense, this is balanced between the black plum fruits and dry tannins. It's a wine for long-term aging, so drink from 2018."
US,87,40,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Muse 2009 Red (Shenandoah Valley),"Subdued notes of blackberry and dark cherry, cigar box and undergrowth lead the aromas on this Bordeaux-style blend. It has a supple core, which is framed by sinewy tannins and balanced acids. The finish is medium in length and grippy, ending on a spiced-cherry flavor."
US,93,29,Riesling,white,Chehalem 2015 Wind Ridge Block Riesling (Ribbon Ridge),"A superstar in this new vintage, this wonderfully concentrated and well-delineated wine offers precise fruit flavors of etched and sculpted peach, apricot and melon in perfect proportion. There is ample acidity under the 19 g/l residual sugar."
US,91,38,Syrah,red,Belharra 2014 Las Madres Vineyards Syrah (Carneros),"Stewy and rustic when first tasted, this wine develops intrigue in the glass. A mixture of fresh compost and minty earth aromas underlie concentrated baked plum and clove flavors. Ripe and robust, it drinks fresh and fruity."
US,90,22,Zinfandel,red,Sausal 1997 Century Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Old-vine straw, tobacco and herb in the nose. The wine is subtle, sensual and complex, with layers of interesting spicy flavor. Nicely balanced and flavorful, with a long, firm finish."
US,87,42,Pinot Noir,red,Cartograph 2009 Perli Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge),"Although there's only 25% new oak on this wine, it's dominated in youth by caramel and buttered toast aromas and flavors. That makes it awkward, despite ripe, forward cherry and raspberry fruit. Might calm down after a few years."
France,88,36,Syrah,red,Château Maris 2005 Old Vine Syrah (Minervois La Liviniere),"A touch funky and green at first, that soon blows off to reveal a dark and wonderfully concentrated wine that shows some serious promise with age. Cassis, plum, black cherry, spice and tobacco fill the palate, with a long, smoky finish sealing the deal. Drink after 2010. Imported by The Portfolio Group."
US,90,28,Merlot,red,Dumas Station 2010 Estate Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Merlot remains a solid strength at Dumas Station, thanks to the Minnick Hills and Birch Creek Vineyard fruit. Half the barrels were new, an equal percentage of French and American oak, lending a strong bourbon aroma, along with tobacco and vanilla components. The fruit remains a bit constrained, with black fruits leading into a core of cassis. Give this one a good decanting."
Italy,90,25,Red Blend,red,Tenuta Argentiera 2007 Villa Donoratico  (Bolgheri),"This opulent and reasonably priced blend of Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc is enhanced by a soft Merlot component. A sweet, rich wine with pretty aromatic highlights of mature fruit and spice."
US,88,59,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,HammerSky 2007 Party of Four Estate Grown Red (Paso Robles),"This Bordeaux blend, based on equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is softly opulent and ripe, in the way of many Paso Robles red wines. It floods the mouth with blackberries and currants, with spicy complexities from oak, and is fairly tannic, although not so much that a good steak won't cut through it. Best Now–2012."
US,80,36,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Calcareous 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (York Mountain),"This is just barely drinkable, with modest blackberry fruit. It's hot and Port-like, right through the raisiny finish."
US,88,19,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Markham 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This is a fleshy, voluptuous white, offering smooth, creamy texture around well-defined characteristics of melon, honeysuckle and peach."
Italy,94,43,Sangiovese,red,Cinciano 2010 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Made with 100% Sangiovese, this stunning but reserved wine opens with multifaceted aromas of underbrush, violet, black berries and just a whiff of leather. The delicious, structured palate delivers vibrant black cherry and ripe raspberry alongside notes of black pepper and grilled rosemary. It's impeccably balanced by fresh acidity and a tannic backbone. It's still young so give this time to fully develop. Drink 2016–2022."
Italy,87,40,Red Blend,red,Corte Moschina 2013  Amarone della Valpolicella,"This brawny, one-dimensional red offers flavors of raisin, dark spice, a note of powdered sage and the heat of evident alcohol. Bracing, grainy tannins leave a sharp finish."
US,91,22,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Canoe Ridge 2009 Vineyard Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Excellent fruit shines forth in this estate-grown Cabernet from the winery's Horse Heaven Hills vineyards. Flavors of mixed berry, black cherry and cassis carry a proper hint of fresh herb. Notations of licorice, earth and dark chocolate add depth and complexity to the elegant finish."
US,88,28,Pinot Noir,red,Willowbrook 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Light, clear and aromatically reminiscent of pine, this smooth, soft wine offers spicy acidity around integrated tannins and oak, finishing with a length of cinnamon."
US,87,18,Red Blend,red,Stevens 2009 YesOuiSi Red Red (Yakima Valley),"This is made from declassified barrels originally intended for Stevens 424. It's sharp-edged and spicy, not yet wellintegrated, but substantial, with wild berry flavors and slightly green tannins. A good quaffer, or pair it with a flank steak."
US,92,45,Chardonnay,white,Au Contraire 2014 Mighty Mouse Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Pear compote, salty lemon and limestone define the flavor profile of this medium-bodied white that lives up to its reserve-tier billing. Integrated oak meets lifted acidity, providing a refreshing, food-friendly experience."
US,86,20,Chardonnay,white,Lamoreaux Landing 2007 Estate Bottled Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"The delicate nose on this reserve Chard offers citrus and flowers with a touch of nutty spice. On the palate, it's a straightforward white with elements of lemon citrus, grapefruit and hazelnut. An easy-drinking Chardonnay with class."
US,86,23,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Fox Run 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),"This forward, fruity Cabernet Sauvignon is plummy and ripe with notes of black cherry preserves and cassis liqueur. It's plush on the palate, with soft, sunny acidity, but moderate alcohol keeps it fresh and quaffable."
US,93,39,Pinot Noir,red,Black Ridge 2008 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Quite as good as the excellent '07, maybe even better, as it shows a little more structure behind the raspberry and cherry flavors. Tastes really good, a silky, spicy and dry wine that's a pleasure to drink. What a shame how little Pinot is actually grown in the Santa Cruz Mountains."
France,85,19,Pinot Gris,white,Pierre Sparr 2013 Pinot Gris (Alsace),"This is an attractive, ripe style of Pinot Gris. Off dry, it is aromatic, lightly spicy over crisper pear and yellow fruit flavors. It's ready to drink."
US,90,28,Chardonnay,white,Woodward Canyon 1999 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Lovely, fruity wine, with ripe apples and peaches dominating. But there's also plenty of toasty new oak and roasted hazelnuts. Soft and approachable, with a bright, hot finish."
US,92,50,Zinfandel,red,Gary Farrell 2013 Grist Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Intensely dense and feral, this wine opens with a thicket of tart cherry and strawberry, followed by leathery black pepper and lavender. Medium in body and acidity, it works for the table, finding balance as it goes, before a rich taste of toffee finishes things off."
US,84,35,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Fess Parker 2010 The Big Easy Red (Santa Barbara County),"Made from Syrah, Petite Sirah and Grenache, this robust, tannic blend has sweet-tasting jam and cola flavors, plus a note of peppery spice. It's a little hot due to the high alcohol, and it has a touch of green vegetable on the midpalate. Drink up."
US,91,28,Syrah,red,Larner 2014 Transverse Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"For a lower-priced bottling, this is a fantastic wine, showing elderberry, black peppercorns and incense on a classic nose. Touches of asphalt, lavender, thyme and sagebrush show on the palate, spicing a core of elderberry and black cassis. Hints of white pepper complete the experience."
US,89,45,Chardonnay,white,Bell 2014 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Yountville),"This is a lusty white buoyed by acidity, swirling in wisps of vanilla cream, cinnamon and a twist of lemon meringue. Ripe in flavor and rich in oak, it's compelling and inviting on the palate, with a suggestion of fennel."
US,90,18,Red Blend,red,Abacela NV Vintner's Blend #16 Red (Umpqua Valley),"Roughly half estate-grown Tempranillo, this smooth and deeply-fruited red includes small amounts of 10 other grapes. For all that it's complete, complex and composed, with pomegranate jam, loganberries, polished tannins and prolonged power. Drink now through 2020."
Italy,90,37,Chardonnay,white,Tenuta Santa Maria 2004 Torre Pieve Chardonnay (Veneto),Winemaker Gaetano Bertani has shaped a sophisticated expression of Chardonnay with thick notes of honey and toast achieved with eight months of oak aging. The wine is soft and creamy but has the right level of acidity to keep it pleasantly refreshing and enduring.
France,93,23,Red Blend,red,Domaine Rotier 2015 Renaissance Red (Gaillac),"This wine comes from the stony slopes above the river Tarn, 45 minutes northeast of Toulouse. That gives it its strongly mineral texture and powerful tannins. A blend of rare and local Duras, Braucol and Prunelard grapes, it's firm and structured while also full of great black fruit and potential. Drink from 2021."
US,93,46,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Jada Vineyard & Winery 2010 Passing By Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Exceedingly rich and sweet in blackberries, currants and chocolate, this Cab is also high in alcohol, but there's no heat. The glycerine-like sweetness is part of the enjoyable package. 100% new French oak is not out of balance, bringing sweet vanilla and toast to the package. Defines the Paso style of warmth, opulence and soft deliciousness."
France,88,55,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Beychevelle 2007  Saint-Julien,"Soft, rounded, a wine that is both fresh and open. Red berry fruits are suffused with acidity, giving a light touch. This is a wine for drinking in 2–3 years."
Italy,90,30,Chardonnay,white,Altemasi 2011 Millesimato Brut Chardonnay (Trento),"Ripe apple, pear and bread crust aromas follow through to the firm palate of citrus zest and toasted almond. It's balanced by bright acidity while a refined perlage adds elegance."
US,90,12,Riesling,white,North by Northwest 2011 Wallula Benches Riesling (Horse Heaven Hills),"Quite tart and bone dry, this is made from fruit sourced from the Wallula Benches Vineyard—a site also prominently featured in Pacific Rim's Riesling lineup. Racy and gin-like in its flavor profile, it emphasizes botanical and citrus notes, with good penetration and length."
France,86,19,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Fournier Père et Fils 2006 La Charnivolle  (Menetou-Salon),"Menetou-Salon is a near neighbor of Sancerre. Its wines are, like this, lighter and leaner than the better-known appellation. This wine displays a soft but herbaceous, grassy character with a steely edge. Drink now."
US,91,58,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Stags' Leap Winery 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Small amounts of Malbec, Merlot, Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot punctuate this well-made wine, layered in red currant and cassis, with classic highlights of cedar and graphite. Softly integrated tannin and oak provide approachability, before a powerful, lingering finish."
France,87,60,Pinot Noir,red,Olivier Leflaive 2010  Chassagne-Montrachet,"In the past, there was much more red wine than white wine produced in Chassagne-Montrachet. This firm, tannic wine, with its austere fruit, shows a similarity to Pommard. This is a wine that needs to age for over several years in order for it to soften and become round, and for the red berry fruit to surface."
US,89,40,Pinot Noir,red,Rusack 2012 Reserve Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Violets and rose petals lead the nose, followed by ripe blackberries and, with a bit of patience, some warm pie crust. The flavors are pleasant but hard to pin down, with flashes of licorice, red currant, allspice and orange peel."
France,87,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Altimar 2011  Lalande de Pomerol,"From a vineyard that is split between Pomerol and Lalande de Pomerol, this wine is still firm and tannic—typical of the vintage. It seems more structure than fruit and will probably remain somewhat tough. It is ready to drink."
Italy,86,17,Red Blend,red,Lungarotti 2012 Rubesco Red (Torgiano),"A blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Colorino, this informal red has subdued aromas suggesting of dark-berry, violet and a hint of kitchen spice. The light-bodied simple palate shows black cherry, dried plum alongside soft tannins."
US,87,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Joseph Carr 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa County),"There's lots of rich, ripe blackberry and cherry jam, dark chocolate and cassis liqueur flavor in this dry, stylish Cabernet. While it's a little on the direct side, and is not an ager, it's a fine value, showing real Napa sophistication."
US,83,20,Zinfandel,red,Carol Shelton NV Black Magic Late Harvest Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Other than being very sweet, this dessert wine has little to recommend it. It's soft and rich in white sugar flavors, with traces of oranges, red currants, chocolate and anise. High alcohol gives it a peppery burn."
France,89,20,Syrah,red,Michel & Stéphane Ogier 2012 d'Ogier Syrah (Vin de France),"This is a medium-bodied, spicy rendering of Syrah. Cherries, herbs and spice all mingle easily, while the silky texture is its calling card. Drink now–2023."
US,84,18,Red Blend,red,Sweet Cheeks 2012 Pinot Fusion Red (Oregon),"The Fusion in question is the blend—an unusual combination of 61% Pinot Noir, 21% Syrah and 18% Merlot. Some tasters will find it works well as an everyday, all-purpose red. The jumble of red fruits is matched to a strong streak of vanilla, with some stemmy flavors coming up in the tannins."
US,85,45,Red Blend,red,Le Mistral 2009 Red (Monterey County),"This soft, easy wine is nearing the end of its useful life, so drink up. Made from Syrah, Petite Sirah and other varieties, it's rich in jam, cocoa and wood spice flavors, with a burst of acidity."
US,86,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Kuleto Estate 2012 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"While this wine is a majority varietal, it blends in Syrah, Malbec, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, each co-fermented with the Cab. The tannin weight is pronounced, adding to the richness and concentration of blackberry jam and black pepper, the tannins leathery and lengthy."
Italy,87,325,Sangiovese,red,Argiano 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"This opens with aromas of oak, toast, licorice, coconut and sugared plum. The taut palate offers dried cherry, star anise and a green note of powdered sage but not a lot of fruit richness. Raspy tannins leave a tongue-drying finish."
US,94,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Baldacci 2012 Black Label Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"Spicy and leathery, this lovely wine unfolds with waves of red and blue fruit, from cassis to huckleberry and blueberry pie. Balanced and elegant, it has a substantive, complex finish, revisiting its black pepper introduction around a finely tuned finale of herb. Enjoyable now, it will take on deeper complexity through 2022."
US,85,38,Red Blend,red,DeLorimier 2012 Primo Zin Osborn Ranches Red (Alexander Valley),"A superripe 50-50 split between Primitivo and Zinfandel, this mix has a sweet thickness filled with dark plum, black cherry and vanilla-laced molasses. Full bodied to say the least, it'll pair well with sweet sauces and glazes."
US,87,15,Chardonnay,white,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2010 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Fragrant apple blossom and vanilla custard notes are delightful on this luxurious and balanced Chardonnay. Sweet butter and cream notes on the midpalate add weight, but are offset by brisk acidity and a spray of saline on the finish."
US,85,30,Red Blend,red,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2005 Orphelin Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Orphelin is a real head-scratcher. A mutt wine blend of nine grapes, it might be trying to be Châteauneuf-du-WA except for the Cabernet, Petit Verdot, Pinot Noir and Touriga. Whatever, it comes together in a raisiny, broadly-built, unfocused red wine that could be fine on a picnic."
US,90,60,Pinot Noir,red,Lange 2009 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This needs oxygen to open up past its slightly reductive nose; then it blossoms into a full-bodied, flavorful wine with a broad array of mixed black fruits. Hints of leaf and herb are nicely styled and not intrusive."
US,84,37,Red Blend,red,Ridge 2010 Lytton Springs Red (Dry Creek Valley),"This tastes hotter than the official alcohol of 14.4% abv, giving it a heat that combines with the pepper flavor that lends a prickliness. A flavor of overripe raisin also shows up in this dry blend, which is based on Zinfandel. It's a rustic wine for drinking now."
US,85,10,Riesling,white,Bogle 2010 Riesling (California),"You almost have to classify this Riesling as a dessert wine, because it crosses the line from off-dry into frankly sweet. It's an easy sipper, with honeyed tangerine and pear flavors. Could be a little brighter in acidity, though."
US,86,14,Pinot Gris,white,Monte Smith 2014 Pinot Gris (Russian River Valley),"This wine is made from grapes grown at the Hop Kiln Vineyard in the Russian River Valley, a project of BR Cohn winemaker Tom Montgomery and winemaker Melissa Smith. It's Chardonnay-like in its grasp of green apple and generosity of toasted oak, medium bodied with a burst of ripe peach."
France,90,50,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Jeannin-Naltet 2014 Clos les Grands Voyens Premier Cru  (Mercurey),"This The wine from a monopole vineyard shows the intense acidity of the vintage yet also bursts with red berry fruit, underlined with firm tannins. Drink now, or better yet, from 2018."
US,89,80,Pinot Noir,red,Summerland 2013 Theresa Noelle Estate Proprietor's Reserve Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Much lighter than the winery's other bottling of this level, this wine shows cranberry, light olive and the slightest hint of eucalyptus on the nose. Cranberry, black pepper, pencil lead and earth show on the palate, which makes for a very nice wine, just not quite as stunning as the Bien Nacido version."
US,88,25,Pinot Noir,red,WildStock 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A new brand from Scott Paul, this relatively value-priced wine is tight and tart, with cranberry and black cherry fruit. The acidity juts out a bit, though that may improve with additional bottle age."
Italy,94,29,Red Blend,red,Contucci 2009  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,"This is a classically crafted wine made by one of Montepulciano's most historic estates. It has an alluring bouquet of violet, rose petal, cassis and nutmeg. The palate delivers an intense wild-cherry flavor layered with white pepper and cinnamon, all impeccably balanced by firm tannins and vibrant acidity. Caffo Beverages Inc, Kiwi Distributing."
US,90,20,Merlot,red,Folie à Deux 2013 Merlot (Alexander Valley),"Lipstick cherry and vanilla provide a burst of red fruit succulence around a core of big oak and a leathery midpalate marked by dried sage. Drying tannins belabor the finish, before rediscovering its lovely, though bold, expression of fruit."
US,93,42,Pinot Noir,red,Sojourn 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A blend of several vineyard sites, including Riddle and Pratt, this is a knockout, a testament to fine winemaking in its soft, velvety texture and buoyant acidity and structure. Orange and strawberry provide a tangy ripeness complemented in earth and clove. This is one worth stocking up on."
France,89,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Jean-Michel Cazes 2011 Réserve  (Médoc),"A rich, sweetly fruity wine, its ripe black plum fruit balanced by fine acidity and layered with wood. It is a solid and dense wine, firm and with great juiciness. Likely to age well for 4–5 years."
US,87,30,Pinot Noir,red,Fritz 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"For some reason, Fritz held this wine back eight months later than their very fine 2009 Reserve Pinot. It's a solid wine, silky and pure, but it's a little too sweet in raspberries and cherries, like a granola candy bar."
US,84,41,Syrah,red,Lionheart 2006 Syrah (Santa Barbara),"Tough, dry and tannic, with a gritty mouthfeel that needs rich fare, like a char-broiled steak, to wake it up. Tucked inside the astringency are some cherry, black currant and black pepper flavors."
US,87,20,Merlot,red,Blackstone 2007 Sonoma Reserve Merlot (Sonoma County),"A nice, fleshy young Merlot, vibrant and elegantly constructed. It's ready to drink now for its silky mouthfeel and dry, complex flavors of cherries, red currants, tobacco, herbs and cedar."
US,89,45,Syrah,red,Elephant Seven 2014 Yellow Bird Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Cofermented with 6% Viognier, this is a perfumed wine with notes of fresh flowers, orange peel, herb and blue fruit. The elegant blue fruit flavors persist, with abundant floral accents."
France,86,10,White Blend,white,Domaine la Taste 2015 Colombard-Ugni Blanc-Gros Manseng-Sauvignon White (Côtes de Gascogne),The wine is bright and fruity. It has crisp acidity and a light touch of citrus to go with the lively acidity. Its blend brings out the herbal flavor of Colombard with just a touch of honey from Gros Manseng. Drink now.
Italy,88,37,Chardonnay,white,Ambrogio e Giovanni Folonari 2014 Cabreo La Pietra Chardonnay (Toscana),"Made entirely with Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of toast and whiffs of banana and mango. The aromas carry on to the palate along with a creamy hint of butter."
US,88,35,Chardonnay,white,Comartin 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This appellation blend shows buttered toast with lemon marmalade on the nose, with a growing sense of tropicality. The palate is plush and smoky, with vanilla and cream flavors cut by just enough citrusy tang to keep it serious."
US,94,45,Pinot Noir,red,Silver 2010 Coteau Palmer Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"This wine from Benjamin Silver is peaking right now, with fascinating aromas of exotic red fruits, sesame oil, maple syrup, hoisin sauce, Korean BBQ spareribs and smoked, coffee-crusted meats. It's in your face on the palate too, with pomegranate and rhubarb ripeness mixing into espresso and meatiness."
US,87,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2012 Horse Heaven Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Horse Heaven Hills),"Coming from the warm 2012 vintage, the notes vary from stone fruit, such as apricot, into tropical with dried pineapple. Aged in a mixture of stainless steel and older French oak barrels, it's fresh and appealing while also displaying some weight and density, drinking quite dry with a tart finish."
US,91,35,Pinot Noir,red,Youngberg Hill Vineyards 2014 Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This jumps up and grabs you by the nose immediately, with bright scents of fresh raspberries and highlights of coffee grounds. A lively wine, with immaculate fruit, the concentrated flavors blend strawberries and raspberries, with supporting acids and just a nice touch of barrel flavors."
US,87,48,Pinot Noir,red,Brooks 2014 Big Cheese Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"As with the other single-vineyard wines from Brooks, this was give 18 months in French oak, and shows strong accents of baking spices and plum cake. The fruit leans toward raisins and figs—just on the edge of overripe—and continues into a finish with vanilla wafer and macaroons. There's a lot going on, but it has not (yet) knit together."
US,92,55,Pinot Noir,red,Armitage 2013 Mt. Roberta Reserve Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Bottled with a trippy-looking label that promotes the brand's spiritual bent, this wine has a nose that conveys elegant eucalyptus, purple flowers, fresh pomegranate, wild mint, sage and pencil shavings. Savory roasting herbs and spice show on the palate, from black pepper to oregano and thyme, then warm up toward cherry pie with black cardamom. It finishes crisp."
US,87,20,Riesling,white,Lamoreaux Landing 2013 Red Oak Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Tropical melon and mango notes are wild and effusive on the nose, striking a contrast to a palate that's surprisingly smoky and mineral. Vivacious and zesty on the palate, it's a uniquely composed, enjoyable wine."
Italy,88,150,Merlot,red,Feudi di San Gregorio 2005 Patrimo Merlot (Campania),"Pàtrimo, a pure expression of Merlot from southern Italy, is always a crowd pleaser, but this year's edition is a tad more ripe and jammy than past vintages: 2005 was indeed a hot year. Intense aromas of black cherry and blackberry pie emerge from the nose and the wine's finish is accented by a surprise signature of tart acidity."
US,86,58,Pinot Noir,red,Fulcrum 2014 Landy Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"There's a mildness to this wine that most tastes of dried cherry and cranberry, with a medium-bodied structure of moderate acidity. Forest floor and earthy compost dominate."
US,85,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Goose Watch 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),"With its integrated nose of violet, spice and berry, and its balanced flavors of pepper, mocha and coffee, this wine has an ageable appeal. It's a touch dry, but the tannins are sturdy, the finish long and the overall package impressive. Pair with venison, veal or even cioppino for added value."
US,93,33,Zinfandel,red,Chacewater 2013 Made with Organically Grown Grapes Zinfandel (Sierra Foothills),"Simply delicious, this Zin is well mannered and not too full bodied. Aromas of this dry and elegant wine are like cinnamon and cardamom, and flavors are a little smoky and full of cherries. The mouthfeel is good and gripping due to fine tannins and supportive acidity."
US,88,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Chateau Lafayette Reneau 2012 Owner's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),"Smoked nuts and earth tones lend savoriness to ripe black-cherry and blackberry flavors. Subtle spice and licorice mark the midpalate, leading to a bold, grippy finish."
US,92,20,Syrah,red,Arbor Crest 2009 Three Vineyards Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A gorgeous wine, dense with flavor. Smooth and plummy, it's loaded with thick streaks of licorice, chocolate, baking spices and coffee liqueur. Long and flowing, it just seduces from the first sip to the last swallow."
France,89,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Liversan 2011  Haut-Médoc,"A finely integrated and ripe wine that is full of rich fruits and solid, dusty tannins. It has good concentration, sweet black fruits and great acidity. It will age well; drink from 2017."
US,90,26,White Blend,white,Acquiesce 2015 Belle Blanc White (Lodi),"Dry, elegant and nicely reserved, this light-bodied wine is refreshing and intriguing. Subtlety works its magic in the bosc pear aromas and white peach flavors, and the crisp texture whets the appetite."
US,87,14,Riesling,white,Fulkerson 2010 William Vigne Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake),"Fresh and floral on the nose and palate, this has loads of white flower and Meyer lemon tones. Dry in style, it builds in intensity on the palate, with hints of honey, wax and saline-like minerality that linger on the finish."
France,94,355,Pinot Noir,red,Albert Bichot 2014 Les Amoureuses Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),"Ripe and generous, this floral wine is dense with fruit as much as tannins. It is full of blackberry and plum flavors, ripe while also cut with acidity. The spice that comes from the wood aging shows well, adding a further element. Drink the wine from 2022."
France,89,35,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Faiveley 2014 Clos Rochette  (Mercurey),"With attractive wood flavors, this is a wine with spice, toast and citrus flavors. Orange and yellow fruits come through the lime acidity and zesty texture. Drink from 2017."
US,93,45,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Bonny Doon 2013 Le Cigare Volant Red (Central Coast),"The blend of 55% Grenache, 25% Syrah, 16% Mourvèdre and 4% Cinsaut offers subtle mulberry fruit on the nose, a spicy peppercorn kick and plenty of gamy meats. That funky meat quality, from raw to jerkied, is prominent and pure on the sip, surrounded by exotic plums and Middle Eastern spices."
US,88,24,Zinfandel,red,Brutocao 2010 Hopland Ranches Zinfandel (Mendocino),"A mid-weight Zin, with a tannic backbone and a soft mouthfeel plus, rich and interesting blackberry and coffee. Encrust some ribs, chops or tenderloin in coffee grounds to pair with this wine for explosive results."
US,91,22,Riesling,white,O•S Winery 2007 Champoux Vineyard Riesling (Horse Heaven Hills),"Intense, spicy and loaded with grapefruit, pineapple and citrus, this has a unique intensity and power. If you distill Washington Riesling down to its essential fruit/sugar/acid components, this expresses it beautifully. At just 9.8% alcohol, it's a definite Kabinett style, with so much acid that the 2% sugar does not signify."
Italy,94,60,Sangiovese,red,Castelli del Grevepesa 2011 Lamole Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this offers lovely aromas of iris, fresh violet, perfumed berry and a whiff of sweet baking spice. The elegantly structured palate doles out juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, mocha, white pepper and cinnamon while firm, velvety tannins offer support. It closes on a tobacco note. It's already delicious but hold for complexity. Drink 2016–2021."
US,90,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Fall Line 2013 Artz Vineyard Red (Red Mountain),"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc (42%), Merlot (41%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of flowers, herb, pencil lead and red fruit lead to light, flavorful, reserved and lengthy fruit flavors. The tannins are tightly wound and need some time to uncoil. Best after 2022."
Italy,93,60,Sangiovese,red,Collelceto 2010 Elia Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Charred earth, toast, grilled porcini, cured meat and mocha aromas lead the nose. The juicy palate offers mouthfuls of ripe black cherry, raspberry jam, licorice and menthol framed in big, velvety tannins. Drink 2018–2025."
US,88,16,Syrah,red,Waterbrook 2013 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas of cocoa, spice, vanilla and dark fruit lead, with the oak (20% new French and American) playing a significant role. The blue-fruit flavors are plump in feel, narrowing toward the finish."
France,89,55,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Huguenot 2014 Champ Perdrix  (Marsannay),"This wine is smoky, ripe and packed with tannins. The fruit gives the wine weight although it is not yet fully developed. There is a toasty background to this rich wine with its juicy red-berry fruits and acidity. Drink from 2019."
France,92,30,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Vindemio 2009 Amadeus Red (Ventoux),"Mainly Grenache (80%, the balance is Syrah) aged entirely in tank, this wine features loads of superripe dark cherries and plums, yet with a savory, olive-and meat-tinged aspect as well. Full-bodied, with a velvety texture and a long finish, it should drink well through at least 2016."
US,90,24,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,True Myth 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Smashed blueberries, black gravel, caramel and a touch of oak smoke show on the nose of this stylishly labeled, widely available bottling from the Niven family. Juicy blackberry fruit leads the palate, bolstered by roasted coffee and shaved-chocolate flavors and rounded out by chalky tannins and strong acidic energy."
US,91,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Spring Valley Vineyard 2010 Uriah Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Uriah is Spring Valley's Right Bank-style blend, with Merlot and Cabernet Franc sharing the lead. It's lively and fine-tuned, with a lovely mix of red fruits, spices, and fresh acidity. It spent 21 months in 65% new French oak, to good effect."
US,88,16,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Liberty School 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"A solid wine for the price, this often sells for less than suggested retail in grocery stores. This bottling shows bacon fat, tart blackberry, black loam and baked goods on a just-enough-of-everything nose. The soft palate is smooth, with mouth-coating tannins and flavors of cigar leaf, black currant and black pepper."
US,88,38,Pinot Noir,red,Migration 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Sourced from seven different vineyards across the appellation, this ripe Pinot is savory in flavor, seasoning the dark cherry fruit at its center with spicy cardamom and cinnamon. On the palate comes a taste of thick oak and bacon with sizable tannins."
US,91,52,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Market Vineyards 2012 Acquisition Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"Aromas of toast, coffee, baking spice, herb and dark fruit lead to full-bodied, expansive black-fruit flavors. It pulls no punches but still manages to stay in balance, with a lingering finish that caps it off."
US,88,24,Pinot Noir,red,Tualatin Estate 1998 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Bright in color and full of snappy cherries on the nose. This cherry-dominated profile follows suit on the palate, where the fruit-to-wood-balance swings in favor of the crisp, dry fruit. Charged-up acids provide a jolt, as do the full tannins. It seems to have the right structure to age for a few years."
US,87,25,Red Blend,red,Petroni 2007 Rosso di Sonoma Red (Sonoma Valley),"Somewhat rugged, with edgy tannins, but very flavorful, a nice wine to have with Italian-inspired pasta dishes. Made from Syrah and Sangiovese, with a splash of Cabernet, it's dry and tart, and shows blackberry, cherry and currant flavors."
US,88,12,Pinot Grigio,white,Angel's Cup 2013 Vineyard Selection Pinot Grigio (California),"Tasty flavors like Pippin apple and tangy cherry, plus a smooth and lively texture bring a lot of appeal to this light-bodied wine. The combination of crisp acidity, luxurious mouthfeel and bright but subtle flavors is a winning one."
US,93,125,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Sojourn 2013 Proprietary Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This wine is supremely pretty, inviting in rose petals and violets. Sourced from Oakville Ranch Vineyard and Vineyard Georges III in Rutherford, it deserves its own bottling. Generously soft and complex, it offers a deftness of black cherry, clove and cedar married expertly together."
France,89,20,Syrah,red,Cave de Tain 2009  Crozes-Hermitage,"A fine value in Northern Rhône Syrah, the Tain cooperative's 2009 Crozes-Hermitage is fairly extracted for a Crozes, with plummy, dark fruit alongside hints of clove, leather and coffee. Turns a bit astringent on the finish; try 2013–2018."
US,93,48,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Double Canyon 2012 Double Canyon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"Somewhat light in color, this is an aromatically appealing wine that shows a complex assortment of coffee, vanilla, pencil lead, cherry, blueberry and high-toned herbal notes. It's exquisitely polished in its styling, with plush tannins and a long, lingering finish. A pretty expression of the variety that shows a great degree of elegance and deftness, it drinks well out of the gate but continues to improve with additional time to breathe."
US,87,11,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,McManis 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"This wine has a strong layer of spicy oak from the first sniff through the lingering finish. Deep, ripe black cherry and blackberry flavors fill in the palate, and the full body of moderate tannins creates a mouthfeel that's plush."
US,83,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Bink 2009 Randle Hill Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Yorkville Highlands),"If you like strong, New Zealand-style gooseberry notes, you'll love this Sauvignon Blanc. It's ultra-dry, potent in acidity and zesty clean. But it does tread dangerously close to feline spray, suggesting unripeness."
US,84,34,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Joullian 2007 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Carmel Valley),"A bit rustic in the mouth, with candy-sweet cherry and blackberry flavors. Drink now."
US,91,55,Red Blend,red,Milbrandt 2011 Sentinel Northridge Vineyard Red (Wahluke Slope),"A Cabernet-based blend, with Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot, this offers pleasing aromatic complexity, with notes of coffee, dark fruit and vanilla, accented by floral overtones. The palate is full bodied, with abundant coffee and cherry flavors backed by firm tannins. The fruit and oak seem to tussle a bit at present; try after 2017."
US,84,28,Pinot Noir,red,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2012 Estate Grown and Bottled Pinot Noir (Alexander Valley),"On the thin side of light-bodied, this has an abundance of oak that overpowers the subtle fruit in this wine from an estate property in a relatively warm appellation. Ripe dark cherry takes on a baked quality here."
France,87,60,Chardonnay,white,Chanson Père et Fils 2005 Hauts Marconnets Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),"An intensely perfumed wine that smells of a candy shop. It has tight acidity, but that is lost in the welter of white fruit flavors, allied with sweet wood. It seems at first too sweet, but then toast and acidity come in to give the wine an edgy finale."
US,85,17,Pinot Gris,white,Benton-Lane 2011 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),A light lime flavor comes with a pleasing hint of tangerine in this wine. It becomes quite slender as it rapidly runs into a slightly metallic finish.
US,91,30,Pinot Noir,red,Hahn 2014 SLH Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is a lot of heady wine for a relatively affordable price. Aromas of black-cherry syrup, baked black plum, nutmeg, clove and gingerbread make for an attention-grabbing nose. The hearty palate shows similar elements, along with black peppercorn, Christmas spice, dense blackberry paste, chaparral scrub and pine-forest notes."
US,86,39,Merlot,red,Colcanyon 2010 Merlot,"Juicy aromas of blackberry and blueberry fruit pick up some baking spice notes on the nose of this bottling from atop the mountains above the Malibu Coast. The flavors are also very fruit-forward, with candied blueberry and clove spice."
US,91,48,Syrah,red,Dehlinger 2013 Altamont Syrah (Russian River Valley),"The second of the producer's estate Syrahs, this one planted in Altamont soils, this full-bodied beauty shows juicy acidity in support of blackberry, blueberry and black licorice. Compost and tea provide an earthy underside, as the finish grips in leather."
US,92,49,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Calcareous 2013 Tres Violet Red (Paso Robles),"Thick black cherry, vanilla, licorice and kirsch aromas show on the nose of this blend of 40% Syrah, 34% Grenache and 26% Mourvèdre. The palate is also rich and juicy, with black currant, nutmeg and caramel-laced cappuccino flavors, bolstered by bright acidity."
US,89,28,Pinot Noir,red,La Honda Winery 2014 Sequence Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"There's a fresh element to the nose of this bottling, with pomegranate and black raspberry fruit as well as nutmeg spice. A leathery structure arises on the palate, offering blackberry fruit, earthy loam and a eucalyptus touch."
US,88,42,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Brecon Estate 2012 Forty Two Red (Paso Robles),"This blend from a newer Westside Paso winery offers blackberry, charred pine and sour cherry aromas. The palate is driven by pine sap, charred game and sharp herbs such as oregano and rosemary, and would be a great way to spice up a steak dinner."
US,93,35,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Rochioli 2015 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Exotic wafts of almond and lemongrass make way for an intensity of lemon pith and grapefruit in this wholly satisfying, well-crafted and refreshingly complex white, a sure sign that this variety can thrive in the appellation."
France,88,50,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Guillemot-Michel 2013 Quintaine  (Viré-Clessé),This wine offers ripe yellow fruits and soft acidity. A honeyed character adds to the richness and generous character of this warm wine that is lightly cut by acidity at the end.
US,93,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Lauren Ashton Cellars 2011 Cuvée Estelle Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Merlot is the principal grape here, with Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot filling out the blend. This is an elegant, sculpted wine, built upon a sturdy foundation of supple, ripe Columbia Valley fruit. Raspberry and cherry flavors get a spicy lift from the Petit Verdot, while the Cabernet adds focus and heft to the tannins."
US,91,45,Red Blend,red,Cadence 2006 Ciel du Cheval Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"Dense and juicy, bursting with a mix of berries and cassis. A delicate balance of acids and fine, ripe tannins provides the structural underpinnings, with the vineyard's characteristic streak of iron ore running straight down the spine."
Italy,87,10,Red Blend,red,Fattoria Laila 2012  Rosso Piceno,"Rich black berry flavors lead in this delicious blend of 80% Montepulciano and 20% Sangiovese. The juicy fruit carries over to the palate, with notes of balsamic herbs alongside big, ripe tannins. It's a straightforward wine for everyday pleasure. Drink now."
US,88,30,Pinot Noir,red,Sebastiani 2010 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is the richest and most satisfying of the winery's four 2010 Pinot Noirs. It's not an ager, but the flavors of raspberry and cherry jam are forward and tasty, with a tart edge of spicy licorice. Drink it now for maximum freshness."
US,92,100,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Steven Kent 2009 The Premier Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"A new addition to Steven Kent's lineup of exemplary Cabernets, this is 100% Cabernet from Ghielmetti Vineyard, one of Kent's favorite pieces of Livermore ground. The wine is concentrated and rich, with heady notes of dark cherry, cinnamon and clove, plus a trace of mint hiding in the background. This will please fans of California and Bordeaux wines."
US,84,13,White Blend,white,LoveThisLife 2009 White (California),"Made to appeal to the modern taste for sweetness, this blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Viognier is simple in jammy apricot, citrus and tropical fruit flavors. It has bright acidity, which helps balance it."
US,85,12,Zinfandel,red,Cline 2012 Zinfandel (Lodi),"Cline makes a lot of this wine and they do a good job with it. Soft and leathery in spicy baked plum and blackberry, this is a perfet wine to pair with a myriad of midweek meals and outdoor parties."
US,87,45,Pinot Noir,red,Pfendler 2008 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"When a young Pinot Noir is dominated by oak, as this one is, it's a little worrying. Will the oak be absorbed in time, or will it always be excessive? This young wine has pleasant cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors, but the oak seems to have the upper hand. Drink soon."
US,90,55,Syrah,red,Eleven Eleven 2013 Estate Syrah (Oak Knoll District),"Inky, rich and dense, this wine has an abundance of red and black berry pie going on that makes it decadently inviting. Thick on the palate, it's ready to pair with saucy cuts of meat, its background note of smoke the ideal way to bring out charred flavors in a food."
US,87,42,Zinfandel,red,Wilson 2014 Carl's Estate Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Vanilla, cherry and raspberry flavors are complemented by smoky meat and tar in this softly built, mellow and pensively sweet wine that's ripe and generous in body."
US,93,85,Pinot Noir,red,Challen 2013 Jasper Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This hearty and heavily spiced take on the grape offers fascinating black cherry, cardamom, chai spice and sanguine, meaty scents on the nose. The flavors may strike some palates as too intense, brimming with dried red cherry, Indian spice and kalamata olive, bound by energetic acidity and tactile grip."
US,85,24,Chardonnay,white,Rutherford Hill 2010 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Buttered toast, buttered popcorn, orange marmalade and lemon zest flavors characterize this lush, creamy Chardonnay."
France,87,7,Pinot Noir,red,Le Pépin 2015 Pinot Noir (Vin de France),"This is a direct but tasty and well-balanced Pinot, with vibrant aromas and flavors of juicy cherry, blueberry and wild strawberry, all graced by hints of purple flowers and sweet spice. The mouthfeel is soft yet structured, with delicate tannins and a slight lushness that lingers on the finish."
US,92,27,Syrah,red,Jaffurs 2010 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Here's a rich, ripe, opulent Syrah, all jammy blackberry, cherry and currant flavors, sprinkled with black pepper and housed in a structure of firm, strong tannins. It's a blend of some of the best vineyards in the county, including Bien Nacido, Larner and Ampelos. Drink now–2015."
US,96,100,Pinot Noir,red,Styring 2012 Wit Reserve Estate Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"The aromatic opening suggests tea and tobacco, while the palate is packed with blackberry, black cherry and cassis fruit. This wine has density and complexity yet it's smooth, superrich, toasty and chocolaty. It manages to retain a sense of finesse along with all that power."
US,93,49,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Chappellet 2009 Signature Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Another terrific Signature Cabernet from Chappellet. This has primary blackberry and cherry-jam flavors, with an additional note of toasty oak. The tannins and acids are excellent, lending structure to the richness. The result is a wonderfully-complex Napa Cabernet that should develop over the next six years."
US,91,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Tamarack Cellars 2009 DuBrul Vineyard Reserve Red (Rattlesnake Hills),"This is made from 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the balance Merlot and Cabernet Franc, all aged 22 months in half new French oak. It's brooding, with notes of dark chocolate, cherry and herbs. It shows more direct tannic heft than often seen at this site and will benefit from some time in the cellar."
US,87,38,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Silver Horse 2011 Sage Red (Paso Robles),"Enormously rich and ripe with flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, gingerbread and caramel, this Malbec-based blend has soft, complex tannins. Its best opened soon, to drink with beef dishes."
US,90,45,Syrah,red,Gorman 2006 The Pixie Syrah (Red Mountain),"This is bright, hot, spicy and (initially at least) showing some high tones that lift the flavors but also attenuate the midpalate. It's aromatic, with sweet cherry fruit, hot and spicy tannins and enough new oak (60%) to add butter and butterscotch to the finish."
France,92,35,Syrah,red,Delas Frères 2011 François de Tournon  (Saint-Joseph),"This is a dark, plush Saint-Joseph, not an edgy, wiry, herb-scented version. Superripe plum and licorice notes are framed by soft tannins and hints of baking spices, but the wine' essential Syrah nature comes through on the dusty pepper-and-anise finish. Drink now–2020."
US,82,11,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Spin the Bottle 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Good red wine in a light, herbaceous style. Tastes fresh and clean as if it was made with good quality standards. Lacks much Cabernet character, however, but adds sufficient cherry and berry flavors to make it complete."
US,87,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Jack Nicklaus Wines 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Rich and opulent, in the popular style, this Cabernet offers soft, oak-driven flavors of blackberries, black cherries and cherry liqueur. It's a gentle, delicious and fancy wine, if a little one-dimensional. Drink now."
US,87,15,Riesling,white,Lamoreaux Landing 2016 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Earthy, dusty mineral tones on the nose fade to reveal juicy grapefruit and red apple on the palate of this approachable off-dry Riesling. Bright, lemony acidity lends vitality to a moderately long finish."
US,88,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Armstrong Family 2011 David's Folly Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot has aromas of orange peel, plum, coffee, vanilla and herbs. It's elegant in style with soft fruit flavors and a light tannic structure along with quite tart acids."
France,92,66,Chardonnay,white,Henri de Villamont 2010 Blagny Premier Cru  (Meursault),"This big, ripe and fruity wine shows both the richness and the structure of the vintage, but never loses sight of balance. It's full of rich yellow fruits, green plums and citrus, but structured with refreshing acidity, a minerally texture and gentle hints of wood aging. Drink from 2015."
US,88,35,Zinfandel,red,Bella 2006 Belle Canyon Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"More tannic than in past vintages, Bella's '06 Belle Canyon shows the same briary, brambly flavors, with spicy wild berries and olive tapenade accented with fresh green sage, black pepper and rosemary. Drink this exuberant Zin soon, with spicy grilled meats."
US,93,40,Syrah,red,Gramercy 2013 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Les Collines, Minick, Old Stones, SJR, Oldfield and Olsen provide the fruit for this wine. It's perfumed and leads with aromas of violets, dried herbs, olive and earth, with raspberry notes emerging over time. The palate is all about texture and elegance, while lingering on the finish."
France,89,30,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Dampt Père et Fils 2013 Beauroy Premier Cru  (Chablis),"This perfumed, soft wine only slowly shows a more structured character. From a well-situated vineyard just above the Serein valley, it offers yellow fruits that are cut with tight citrus and minerality. Drink from 2017."
US,90,42,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Kuyam 2007 Cuvée Nolan Santa Barbara Highlands Red (Santa Barbara County),"Named after winemaker David Corey's son, this 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Cabernet Franc, 4% Petit Verdot and 3% Merlot begins with nose-tickling scents of berry syrup and smoked cigars. The maduro cigar flavor consumes the palate, with black cherry fruit and smooth tannins. It can stand up to a fat stogie or gamy meats like lamb."
US,91,45,Pinot Noir,red,Raptor Ridge 2014 Meredith Mitchell Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"This vineyard selection captures the defining character of this tiny AVA—an underlying streak of gun metal, and an overall austerity that belies the complexity and subtle length of the wine. Tart cranberry fruit brings supporting acidity, and the wine rewards your attention with extra length and detail. Drink 2018 to 2028."
US,83,20,Red Blend,red,Walter Dacon 2008 Skookum Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Kool-aid character, light raspberry fruit, slightly candied, with an artificial tang to the finish."
US,93,50,Zinfandel,red,Robert Biale 2012 Stagecoach Vineyards The Biale Block Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"The winery's proprietary block of Zin grapes (planted in 1999) from the coveted Stagecoach Vineyards contributes to an intense wine. Juicy and oaky, it's dense in cherry and plum, a note of lavender and sage complementing the whole. A thick liqueur sense characterizes the texture, but the palate stays alive through the site's rocky minerality. This one'll age."
France,87,38,Chardonnay,white,Marcel Couturier 2015 Le Clos Reyssie  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"This is a tight, textured wine, with plenty of acidity to balance the ripe fruit. It has the generous texture typical of the vintage and ripe yellow fruits, with an attractive crisp aftertaste. Drink now."
US,93,50,Red Blend,red,Arger-Martucci 2005 Odyssey Red (Atlas Peak),"This is a big, powerful and still young Cabernet blend that's not ready to drink yet. The massive blackberry, black currant, violet and dark chocolate flavors haven't meshed with the smoky oak, while a cut of fruity acidity makes for a tart mouthfeel. But it should easily negotiate the years. Better after 2011, and should blossom afterwards."
US,85,9,Merlot,red,Coast 2014 Merlot (California),"This is an easy-drinking, crowd-pleaser of a wine. Light to medium bodied, it has fresh strawberry and cherry flavors and a soft, smooth texture."
US,88,29,Pinot Noir,red,King Estate 2006 Signature Collection Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This widely available Oregon Pinot Noir has lovely aromas of berry, cherry and rose petals. Ripe but not sweet, its tart, juicy fruit is wrapped in plenty of acid and punctuated with fresh herb, resin and peppery spice. Nicely blended and balanced, it's a quintessential food wine."
US,89,22,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,The Federalist 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"A lavish oak component makes this full-bodied wine very aromatic—smoke, black pepper, cardamom—and also adds a spicy accent to the bold, ripe fruit flavors. The rich texture feels velvety in the mouth, and the spicy oak and potent fruit notes echo on the finish."
US,85,21,Pinot Noir,red,Joleté 2014 Le Verre Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This starts out well, with soft, plummy fruit. It then turns a corner into an odd, lingering finish with residual flavors of sour fruit, plastic and gun metal."
France,88,15,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Chapelle d'Aliénor 2015  Bordeaux Blanc,"In 2001, Aliénor and Alexandre de Malet Roquefort bought this property which is 15 minutes southeast of their Château La Gaffelière. From 8.5 acres of Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon and Muscadelle, this is a rounded, soft wine that promises well. It is going towards the tropical fruit area with its apricot and pineapple flavors. Behind, the acidity is tangy and crisp with a tight, nervy aftertaste."
US,87,15,Chardonnay,white,Cosentino 2013 The Chard Chardonnay (Lodi),"Ripe fruit flavors advance from apple to pear to honey as you sniff and sip this wine. It tastes clean and fruity, with a medium body and a smooth texture that allows the fruitiness to linger on the finish."
France,91,35,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Les Trois Couronnes 2010 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"This blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Syrah and 20% Mourvèdre delivers juicy, almost gulpable fruit, supported by a loose spine of soft tannins. Purple raspberry and black cherry flavors linger on the supple finish. Drink now–2018."
US,88,48,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Rôtie Cellars 2015 Southern Blend Red (Washington),"This wine is 70% Grenache with the rest equal parts Mourvèdre and Syrah. Aromas of olive, earth, orange peel, black pepper and flower are followed by full-bodied red and black-fruit flavors. It shows intrigue but doesn't quite come together."
US,92,92,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Alpha Omega 2010 Proprietary Red (Napa Valley),"One word describes this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend—huge. It's thick and dense in the mouth, with considerable tannins framing ripe, complex flavors of blackberries, currants, green olives, mocha and toasty oak. In need of aging, it should begin to mellow after 2018."
US,88,54,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Scroll 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Medium-strength, this wine opens with a bouquet of black cherry and raspberry, unveiling an intensity of smoke and heat as it goes. Cradled in oak, it flattens on the midpalate before rising in strength and length on the finish."
US,86,27,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Frei Brothers 2014 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),Chocolate-covered strawberry meets rich brown sugar and cola notes in this medium-bodied wine that's moderately structured and round. It finishes in a plume of subtle smoky oak.
US,88,19,Chardonnay,white,Drink Washington State 2014 Welcome to Columbia Valley Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Chardonnay's lees, custard, pear and spice aromas are somewhat inharmonious. It's elegant on the palate, however, showing graceful apple flavors."
US,84,25,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Together 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This is a woody, generously oaked white that's full and relatively fleshy, with a perception of ripe sweet fruit and vanilla."
Italy,93,100,Red Blend,red,Tua Rita 2013 Giusto di Notri Red (Toscana),"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this opulent wine opens with aromas of black currant, graphite and baking spice. The juicy concentrated palate delivers black cherry, blackberry, tobacco and licorice framed in bold polished tannins. Drink now through 2023."
US,90,21,Zinfandel,red,Midnight 1998 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Good color, tight, firm fruit, with some heft to it. There's cassis as well as cherry, and the wine has the weight of a Sonoma Zin, with good acids to give it lift. This is the first estate bottling from this exciting new winery. Unfortunately, just 28 cases made."
US,88,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Merryvale 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A soft, easygoing red wine that's dry and classically made, this is more on the full-bodied style than slim. Chalky tannins provide substantial texture alongside chocolate and pinches of pencil shavings, finished in blackberry pie."
US,88,36,Chardonnay,white,Gracianna 2015 Suzanne's Blend Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"There's a lot to like in this youthful, concentrated white, from its tartness of green apple and lime to its mineral-laden acidity. Full bodied, it never loses that sense of verve on the palate, which helps rein in the ripeness."
US,89,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Seven Hills 2014 Klipsun Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"Aromas of barrel toast, spice and cherry lead to a somewhat barrel-forward palate, filled with coffee and cherry flavors along with firm tannins. It drinks tight now and needs some time to unwind."
US,87,18,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Joel Gott 2012 815 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"This offers strong oak and smoke aromas, plus ripe black cherry, chocolate and plum flavors. Full body and firm tannins make it assertive. Not a cocktail wine, this needs to pair with some heavy meat."
France,87,19,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Saint-Urban 2014  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"This fruity, black-currant-flavored wine comes from a blend of Merlot and Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc. A strong, smoky tannin character lies under the fruit and makes the wine both structured and fresh, with blackberry acidity at the end. This promises some aging; drink from 2017. An Alliance Bourg member."
Italy,94,75,Sangiovese,red,Querce Bettina 2010  Brunello di Montalcino,"Forest floor, leather, fennel and woodland berry aromas lead the nose. The vibrant palate delivers crunchy red cherry-berry, eucalyptus, sage and a balsamic note alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017–2025."
US,87,60,Zinfandel,red,Mazzocco 2005 Reserve Maple Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"With nearly 17% alcohol, aficianados of high-octane Zin will love this bottling's wealth of black currant, blueberry jam, chocolate and anise flavors that finish dry and peppery."
US,86,22,Pinot Grigio,white,Benessere 2014 Pinot Grigio (Napa Valley),"This is an intense, oaky and savory mix of ripeness and power. Although the fruit is muted and understated, the wine is full bodied in style and weight."
US,84,20,Chardonnay,white,Comtesse Thérèse 2007 Russian Oak Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),"Aged 14 months in Russian Oak, this is a different kind of Chard with notes of chamomile, fresh mint sprigs, vanilla and cigar tobacco among the more typical melon fruits and lime citrus. Medium-full but a bit flat in the mouth with a solid but quite smoky finish."
US,94,63,Pinot Noir,red,Merry Edwards 2014 Georganne Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Planted in 2006, this vineyard is one of the newer sites for the “Queen of Pinot,” who coaxes a strong-willed, high-strung complement of charcuterie and wild lavender from its vines. Bright red currant and raspberry are met by floral, herbal competition, which vies for attention on the palate, girded by strong tannins and mellow oak."
US,91,24,Riesling,white,Standing Sun 2013 Camp 4 Vineyard Riesling (Santa Barbara County),"This wine shows a very intriguing nose of iodine, preserved lemons, orange marmalade and dried daffodils. The palate is quite distinctive with dried jasmine flowers, dried lemon peels and a sour-orange element shining throughout."
France,89,16,Red Blend,red,Cave Cooperative du Vendômois 2014 Cuvée Prestige Red (Coteaux du Vendômois),"This is a rare red wine in this Loir Valley appellation, wood aged and rich. A blend of Pineau d'Aunis with Pinot Noir and Cabernet Franc, it is densely textured and full of spice as well as blackberry fruit. Full in the mouth, replete with fruit, it is ready to drink."
US,89,65,Pinot Gris,white,Balletto 2009 Vin de Paille Estate Pinot Gris (Russian River Valley),"Incredibly rich and sweet with honey, apricot and orange flavors, this intense dessert wine is balanced with citrusy acidity. It's super-delicious, long and gooey sweet on the finish."
France,90,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Giscours 2012 Le Haut-Médoc de Giscours  (Haut-Médoc),"From vines owned by Château Giscours but outside the Margaux appellation, this ripe and structured wine is a great success. Its rich berry and black currant fruits are pushed forward by the firm tannins that are so perfectly judged. It's a wine to enjoy soon, so drink from 2017."
US,92,52,Pinot Noir,red,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2006 Trenton Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"At two-plus years this Pinot Noir still is an infant. It's a swirl of new toasty oak, ripe cherries and currants, acidity and fresh, chunky tannins. It's a pity that much of it will be opened too young. Should be more harmonious toward the end of 2009, and evolve for many years after."
US,88,29,Zinfandel,red,Opolo 2014 Mountain Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"The mountain aspect of this bottling seems to restrain some of this grape variety's typical exuberance, for better and worse. Light blackberry and dried sagebrush show on the nose, while the palate picks up black raspberry and wet dill flavors."
US,90,49,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,William Grassie 2012 Impératrice Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though labeled as a red blend, at 94% this could be a varietally labeled Merlot and it drinks like it. Aromas of cocoa, raspberry and spice box are followed by plump, soft chocolate and raspberry flavors accented by tart acids that hold the balance through the finish."
Italy,85,10,Pinot Grigio,white,Villa Rubini 2011 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie),"A great value wine, this opens with fresh, easy aromas of citrus, melon and dried hay. It has good depth and a smooth texture."
US,83,33,Merlot,red,Northwest Totem Cellars 2006 Merlot (Yakima Valley),"Chandler Reach grew the grapes for this big, chewy, rather blocky Merlot. It offers pleasant red fruits and light chocolaty barrel notes."
US,92,38,Zinfandel,red,Kokomo 2014 Timber Crest Vineyard Winemaker's Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Sweetly satisfying and succulent, without being technically sweet, this robust, reserve-level wine offers a layered depth of red-cherry cola and leather that keeps it bright on the palate and impressively lengthy."
US,84,13,Riesling,white,Fulkerson 2014 Juicy Sweet Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Juicy sweet is an apt moniker for this fruity, forward Riesling. The grapey, sugary palate is a bit confected in style, but easy and approachable."
Italy,86,38,Red Blend,red,Rignana 2010 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"This blend of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Merlot is heavy on oak. It starts with aromas of toasted oak, coffee and vanilla with just a whiff of black plum. The palate is also dominated by oak extract, chocolate and espresso that muffle the ripe, black fruit gasping beneath the surface. It closes on a bitter note of wood tannins."
US,85,12,Red Blend,red,Smashberry 2012 Red (Central Coast),"Smashberry is the perfect name for this wine. Made from an unstated blend of grape varieties, it tastes like mashed, ripe blackberries, blueberries and cherries. The alcohol level is moderate, but gives the wine a pleasant warmth."
US,92,35,Pinot Noir,red,Elizabeth Chambers 2014 Winemaker's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Tasted alongside the 2013, this is bigger, bolder, fruitier and more powerful, yet a touch less refined. The strawberry and cherry fruit is underscored with a pleasing minerality. The tannins are substantial and in proportion. A hint of chicken stock runs through the finish."
US,87,45,Red Blend,red,Windsor Oaks 2009 Super Tuscan Red (Chalk Hill),"Made from Sangiovese and the classic Bordeaux grape varieties, this is a lusciously ripe but ultimately simple wine. With jam, currant, vanilla and toast flavors, it's nice for drinking now."
US,92,30,Chardonnay,white,Foley 2013 Rancho Santa Rosa Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Sea salt, honeysuckle, lemon-sprayed apple and a touch of graphite dominate the nose of this tasty wine that grows only more interesting with time. Lime zest plays on the edges of the palate, though the middle shows a nectarine and yellow-pear richness. Energetic acidity tickles the tongue throughout the sip."
US,86,35,Merlot,red,Peju 2008 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Peju's Merlots have been inconsistent. When they're good, they're quite good, but you never know. This 2008, from a less successful vintage, is all right. It's dry and tannic and soft in cherry and tobacco flavors. But there's not a lot going on. Drink up."
France,90,55,Chardonnay,white,Henri de Villamont 2009 Les Clous  (Meursault),"On the mineral side of Meursault, the has a very textured feel, with acidity to go with the honey note. Finely balanced, warm and ripe, this has a crisp, tight finish."
US,87,37,Chardonnay,white,Pride Mountain 2009 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Rich and fruity, with tons of pineapple, mango, lime, peach, pear, nectarine and honey flavors. Lots of sweet smoky oak, too. Not particularly complex, but flashy. Drink now."
US,82,32,Chardonnay,white,Riverbench 2006 Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"With an over-oaked taste and sugary flavors of peach, pineapple and apricot jam, this Chard is more like a dessert wine."
US,90,25,Pinot Noir,red,Stoller 2012 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Entirely sourced from the estate vineyard, this is loaded with black cherry fruit, as befits its Dundee Hills location. There's a bit of root beer in evidence, and a modest but complete palate with relatively soft, approachable tannins. Drink this vintage young for optimal enjoyment."
US,87,13,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Bar Dog 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"This is a good, solidly made wine with medium body and a pleasant mix of spicy oak and juicy fruit flavors. The texture goes easy on the palate."
US,85,20,Pinot Noir,red,La Crema 2016 Rose of Pinot Noir (Monterey),"This wine's pink color edges ever so slightly toward brown, and offers aromas of orange juice and pink rose petals. It's a tad flat on the palate, suggesting sour orange and lemon rinds, a touch of maraschino cherry and a slight baking-soda minerality."
US,88,24,Pinot Gris,white,Red Newt Cellars 2010 Curry Creek Vineyards Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),"Ripe notes of stone fruit and apple blossom lend a lavish air to this dry yet penetrating Pinot Gris. It's big and voluptuous, but it finishes clean, with lingering minerality and a flash of green flower."
US,91,42,Chardonnay,white,Eric Kent 2013 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"From three vineyards, including Roberts Road, this wine impresses in floral honeycomb and a freshness that belies its medium-bodied weight and pithy texture, finishing in vanilla that never gets sweet."
US,93,40,Pinot Noir,red,Peake Ranch 2014 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This is the first round of wines from this project by John Wagner, who owns parts of Sierra Madre and John Sebastiano vineyards, and winemaker Paul Lato. Black-plum skins, roasted game, anise and sandalwood aromas show on the nose. Earthy and zesty, the palate delivers cranberry-beet juice along with roasted fennel, eucalyptus oil and bitter Earl Grey tea touches."
US,92,38,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Asuncion Ridge 2014 Salacious Red (Paso Robles),"This blend of 47% Grenache, 35% Mourvèdre and 18% Syrah is reminiscent of a walk through the dewy sagebrush, with dried wild herbs most prominent alongside cola, rustic plum and mulberry and a hint of pine forest. Those forest-like flavors show on the sip as well, with bay leaf, green peppercorn and a savory salts enhancing the baked berry and tangy plum skin elements—a GSM with teeth and structure."
France,88,13,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Lamothe-Vincent 2014  Bordeaux Blanc,"Full of acidity, this is also a really fruity 100% Sauvignon Blanc. Great citrus and green apple flavors go with a mineral edge and a final fresh, crisp aftertaste. Drink from late 2015."
US,92,45,Pinot Noir,red,Merry Edwards 2014 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Smooth and medium-bodied, this is a rounded, lovely expression of rhubarb compote and black tea that's softly layered on the palate. Rose petals invite first before wild blueberry and nutmeg make their mark, supported by juicy acidity and a grippy length of tannin."
US,87,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Avalon 2014 CAB Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Sun-dried raisin and plum notes give this full-bodied and soft-textured wine an easy, ripe and very fruity flavor. Brown sugar and vanilla hints lend a sense of sweetness, making it a great match for chocolate or aged cheeses."
France,85,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Mazails 2011  Médoc,"Bold and juicy, this is a ripe, forward wine. With red berry fruits prominent, it conveys attractive fruitiness. Tannins in the background suggest medium-term aging. Drink from 2016."
US,90,25,Pinot Noir,red,River Road 2014 Stephanie's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"Earthy forest floor and Asian spice ride atop layers of tangy orange and cherry in this wine defined by lively acidity and a juicy core. Medium bodied in weight and breadth, it finishes in chocolate and vanilla, the oak subtle and supportive."
US,91,38,Syrah,red,Muscardini 2011 Unti Vineyards Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"Minty, this restrained Syrah is from a sought-after vineyard, a pioneer in Sonoma County Rhône-style wines. Here, the producer keeps things interesting in swathes of white pepper, mint and cranberry, as well as a strong sense of leather throughout. High in acidity, it needs time to come together; try after 2020."
France,89,28,Pinot Noir,red,Antonin Rodet 2011 Château de Mercey  (Santenay),"While the wine is structured, it does also have plenty of ripe, juicy fruitiness that is already delicious. It's an open wine, rounded and rich in fruit flavor. The tannins are likely to smooth out soon, so drink from 2016."
US,89,45,Pinot Noir,red,Erath 2006 Hyland Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Among Erath's dizzying array of single vineyard and other designated Pinot Noirs, it is almost impossible to single out the real players. This is a very appealing bottle, loaded with cherry fruit and lots of chocolaty oak. Forward, smooth and ready to go."
France,87,15,Riesling,white,Willm 2013 Réserve Riesling (Alsace),"Summer flower aromas with touches of honey give an immediately attractive, fresh character. To taste, it's a crisp and steely wine, full of white fruits and a delicious juicy character. Drink now."
Italy,83,20,Red Blend,red,Bricco dei Guazzi 2005 La Presidenta Red (Monferrato),"Crisp but smooth, this Piedmont blend shows straightforward blueberry and barnyard notes upfront while the palate offers up some fall leaves and ash flavors before fading to an earthy finish. Drink up."
US,94,70,Chardonnay,white,Reuling Vineyard 2014 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"This site continues to wow, especially when featured by this grower-producer. Light, bright and lemony in initial aroma and flavor, it develops additional complexity and nuance in the glass, alighting in apple crumble, anise and mouthfilling succulence, the minerality well defined and vibrantly fresh."
US,90,58,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Niner 2006 Fog Catcher Red (Paso Robles),"This has been an interesting wine from Niner. Last year's bottling was terrific. So's this 2006. At the ripe old age of five, it's still firm in tannins and even has a cut of acidity that gives the blackberry and blueberry fruit a bite. Tastes fresh and lively, and could improve with 5–6 years in the bottle."
US,93,45,Chardonnay,white,Sojourn 2013 Sangiacomo Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"A rich golden color, this unctuous offering is luxuriously layered in honeycomb and vanilla crème brûlée, complex, big and bold. A wall of oak adds structure and density without taking over, opening the door to a finish of juicy ripe fig."
Italy,93,140,White Blend,white,Fattoria di Grignano 1994 Riserva  (Vin Santo del Chianti Rufina),"From the distant 1994 vintage, this Vin Santo blend of Trebbiano and Malvasia has been aged an astonishing 15 years in small oak barrel. You can detect some of that evolution on the bouquet thanks to aromas of dried apricot, marron glacé, maple syrup and candied fruit with cinnamon spice. It's a sweet, thick wine with great intensity and the potential to age many more years to come."
Italy,95,125,Sangiovese,red,Le Ragnaie 2012 VV  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Truffle, forest floor, baked plum and cake spice aromas mingle with whiffs of new leather and pipe tobacco on this bold full-bodied red. The enveloping palate seamlessly combines concentration and finesse, doling out fleshy black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, licorice and mocha alongside big velvety tannins that give the finish nice grip and a polished texture. This will give decades of enjoyment. Drink 2020–2037."
France,94,60,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Henri Bourgeois 2014 Sancerre d'Antan Terroir de Silex  (Sancerre),"Oak aging and no filtration give this beautiful wine richness and dense texture. A touch of spicy toast contrasts with the melon and grapefruit flavors, smoothly ripe texture and nutmeg aftertaste. The wine is concentrated and full in the mouth. This opulent wine is still young, so wait until late 2017 to drink."
US,89,80,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Den Hoed 2012 Marie's View Wallula Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"This is the first vintage of this wine to be labeled as a Cabernet Sauvignon as opposed to a red wine. It brings aromas of fresh jalapeño, herb and cherry. The cherry and plum flavors are rich and layered, backed by tightly coiled tannins."
Italy,89,58,Red Blend,red,Zisola 2012 Doppiozeta Red (Sicilia),"Made with 80% Nero d'Avola and 20% Syrah, this opens with aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, toast, leather and Oriental spice. The firm palate offers ripe black cherry, raspberry jam, vanilla and oak-driven spice alongside fine-grained tannins."
US,93,27,Riesling,white,Smith-Madrone 2013 Estate Bottled Riesling (Spring Mountain District),"From 41-year-old vines on just over five estate acres, this is resiny and briny on the nose. A honey-laced creaminess at the core is tensely accentuated by vibrant acidity. Balanced and elegant, with a sunny bite of ripeness, it revels in nuances of fresh and dried apricot while lighter notes of lemon, lime and grapefruit play backup."
US,90,20,Red Blend,red,Soos Creek 2006 Sundance Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The Sundance blend in 2006 is two-thirds Merlot, the other third splits Cab Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's what the winemaker modestly describes as his “leftovers,” but like the best leftovers it tastes great. It's wide open and broadly appealing, with sweet and soft fruit flavors of ripe berries, cherries and milk chocolate. Along with the ripe, fresh fruit are soft tannins and some pleasing streaks of coffee and licorice."
US,86,22,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,AntoLin Cellars 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Light and forward, this pure Cabernet offers pretty strawberry fruit and soft tannins. Easy drinking, it's built for near-term consumption."
US,88,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Meander 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Tough in tannins, but rich in black currant flavor, this 100% Cab has some elegant features in its purity of structure and dryness. Let it air in the glass for 30 minutes or so before drinking."
US,88,45,Pinot Noir,red,Timothy Malone 2015 La Colina Vineyard Dundee Hills Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Just one barrel of this bottling was produced, but it falls short of the other Dundee Hills cuvées this vintage. It starts out thin, with dilute fruit, cola and mineral notes. With hours of breathing time, it begins to fill out in the middle, so aggressive decanting is recommended."
US,92,58,Pinot Noir,red,Rex Hill 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Supple, almost silky in the mouth, this slips into lush flavors of mocha truffle, with a core of raspberry fruit. It remains a bit tight through the finish, with light streaks of coffee and fresh herb. Delicious already, it seems destined to improve further with a bit more bottle age. Drink now through 2025."
US,90,22,Syrah,red,Syncline 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromatic and silky upon entry, this stylish Syrah brings dark berry fruit flavors laced with toast and smoked meats. It's saturated, bright and sappy, with fine grained tannins that seem to spread the flavors fully across the palate. The finish is of medium length, expanding gradually as the wine airs, and adding vanilla and chocolate flavors."
US,90,26,White Blend,white,Concannon 2015 Reserve Assemblage Blanc White (Livermore Valley),"This very appealing wine smells like a Danish pastry but then turns nicely dry on the palate, gushing with crisp apple, ripe Bosc pear and toasted-baguette flavors. Made from Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc grapes, it's medium bodied, complex and well balanced."
US,87,25,Chardonnay,white,Martin Ranch 2015 J.D. Hurley Griva Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),"Lemon-candy aromas are rounded with white peach, marshmallow and honeysuckle on the slightly sweet-leaning nose of this bottling. The sip is straightforward with lemon peel, slight marzipan, Gala apple and Bosc pear flavors."
France,92,87,Pinot Noir,red,Henri Abele 2008 Le Sourire de Reims Rosé Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),"Made from Pinot Noir grown in the Aube village of Les Riceys, this deep-colored rosé is rich with red fruits and as well as a more mature, toasty character. It's spicy, full in the mouth and ripe. The aftertaste continues the full, generous character of the wine."
US,87,40,Chardonnay,white,Ridge 2007 Monte Bello Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Good structure on this wine, with fine acidity providing clean balance. It sure is fruity, though, with massive pineapple, peach, apple and smoky oak flavors that could use a bit more finesse and subtlety."
France,88,45,Pinot Noir,red,Louis Latour 2014  Monthélie,"Produced in this village in the hills behind the main slope of the Côte de Beaune, this wine is smooth and rich. Fine, soft tannins easily integrate into the sweet texture and red-plum fruit. The acidity is there, giving a wine that is both fresh and generous. Drink from 2018."
US,85,40,Pinot Noir,red,Sonnet 2009 Tondre's Grapefield Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Some unripe vegetal notes mar what is otherwise a fine, silky Pinot Noir, with flavors of raspberry cream and cinnamon spice. Give this lots of breathing before you drink it."
US,94,70,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Serene 2014 Evenstad Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"There is a darker fruit spectrum evident in the reserve, with notes of coffee, smoke, black fruits, a touch of charred wood all worked through, and without damping the core fruit flavors. Those bright flavors spotlight raspberry, plum and black cherry. A light cola flavor pokes through, with ripe tannins and proportionate acids. The barrel treatment is beautifully applied, adding sweet spice to the finish."
US,86,18,Chardonnay,white,King Estate 2013 Signature Collection Chardonnay (Oregon),"Simple and fruity, this has a mix of pineapple, citrus and apple, high-toned and slightly bitter. The toasty component from some sort of barrel/oak treatment is not yet integrated into the fruit. This will need decanting or aging in bottle until 2016."
US,91,29,Syrah,red,Longboard 2011 Syrah (Russian River Valley),"The winemaker has said he makes Russian River Valley Pinot Noir to support his Syrah habit. Here he offers a compelling case in point, making a velvety, substantial 100% Syrah that's more elegant than overpowering. Mocha-kissed tannins play nicely with black and red berry fruit, providing a structure built to age, through 2021."
US,92,55,Pinot Noir,red,WillaKenzie Estate 2014 Kiana Pinot Noir,"This full-bodied wine comes charging ahead with spicy berries and Bing cherries. The tannins are granular, with strong flavors of tobacco, coffee grounds and dark chocolate in the foreground. It's a big-flavored wine from start to finish, with the power and polish to age. Drink 2020 through 2028."
US,88,32,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Gallo of Sonoma 1999 Barelli Creek Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"This ageable wine has sturdy tannins and is a shade too young to drink now. A few years of cellaring will open up the blackcurrant and olive flavors and soften the mouthfeel. If you must open it, try with a perfectly grilled lambchop."
France,88,40,Chardonnay,white,Bret Brothers 2014 Climat Sous les Plantes  (Viré-Clessé),"Made from 65- to 80-year-old vines, this wine offers wood spice as well as apple and citrus fruit flavors. An underlying richness balances the acidity and crisp texture. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017."
US,90,29,Syrah,red,Greenwood Ridge 2013 Estate Bottled Syrah (Mendocino Ridge),"This is an amazingly tasty and focused wine that has the most distinctive black pepper character. It's medium-bodied, dark and smoky looking and quite flavorful, backing up the pepper with lively raspberry notes and staying lively from the first sip to the last."
US,86,16,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Canoe Ridge 2014 The Expedition Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"Plum, spice and sweet herb aromas lead to rounded blue-fruit flavors surrounded by dry, astringent tannins that are unyielding."
US,87,39,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Tapteil Vineyard 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"Made from estate fruit, this wine offers tart blueberry and plum flavors along with drying tannins. The nose displays some volatile aromas, which carry onto the palate. Depending upon your particular sensitivity, this may or may not enhance the experience."
US,86,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Eco Terreno 2013 Old Vine Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Big oak defines this robustly dense and extracted red, swimming in vanilla and cherry flavor. Full-bodied and gravelly in texture, it's a rustically pleasant wine for pizza nights and crowds."
US,85,80,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,L'Aventure 2010 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Even though the alcohol is a high 15.3% abv, this Cabernet tastes like it still has some residual sweetness. It's as rich and ripe in blackberries, but awkward, and doesn't seem capable of aging."
US,88,140,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Jarvis 2010 Estate Grown Cave Fermented Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"An older vintage that's been given more time in bottle before release, this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is herbal, awash in dried thyme and a hint of cedar. Among its firm and jagged tannins is a taste of leathery milk chocolate and crème de cassis."
US,87,38,Pinot Noir,red,Joyful Noise 2014 Lazy River Vineyard Pinot Noir,"This sends up scents of grape jam, plum and cherry, and those round and forward fruit flavors combine in the mouth. It's a tasty young wine, with plenty of immediate appeal from its lollipop-rainbow flavors."
US,90,29,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cameron Hughes 2013 Lot 600 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"From the heart of the Napa Valley, this opens in wafts of baked bread, cedar and herb, additionally exhibiting classical varietal notes like currant and pencil. Full bodied, round and ripe, it lingers in jolts of black pepper."
US,89,30,Chardonnay,white,Bargetto 2015 Regan Vineyards Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Fairly sweet aromas of marzipan, honeysuckle, candied apricot and honeyed orange slices show on the nose of this bottling from a longtime winegrowing family in the Watsonville area. It's much tighter and brighter on the sip, with flavors of slightly sour green-pear skins and poached apple, and a touch of caramel on the finish."
US,89,40,Chardonnay,white,Sbragia 2010 Gamble Ranch Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Ed Sbragia brings his penchant for huge wines to Chardonnay. This '10 is strong and intense in tropical fruits, peaches, buttered toast and vanilla, and while it's balanced and flashy, it will dominate almost any food you pair it with."
US,87,48,Pinot Noir,red,Zepaltas 2007 La Cruz Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Tough and gritty now, with dominating acids that give the wine a hard mouthfeel. Yet there's some impressive red currant, tangerine, ruby grapefruit and cola fruit in there. Will it develop polish and softness? Hard to tell. Decant if you drink now."
US,93,45,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,kukkula 2013 Pas de Deux Red (Adelaida District),"There are loads of fresh floral and red spice notes on the nose of this blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah: hibiscus, cinnamon, dried cherry and baking spice. The palate leads with a touch of maple syrup, filling out with red berry, savory smoke and thyme flavors, underpinned by upright tannins and refreshing acidity."
US,90,35,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Matthews 2016 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This 100% varietal wine brings lightly styled aromas of green grass, herb, snap pea and whiffs of green pepper. The palate is full bodied and textured, bringing a sense of richness but never losing its balance. It lingers on the finish."
US,87,35,Chardonnay,white,Kunde 2011 Reserve Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"Oak dominates this wine, with buttered toast and caramel flavors riding high over orange, green apple and mango notes. The acidity is mouthwatering, adding vibrance to sheer California power."
France,89,14,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Fongalan 2010  Côtes de Bourg,"The wine is rich and still shows firm tannins, along with full-bodied blackberry fruitiness and a tight, crisp texture. It's solid and concentrated, full of juiciness at the end. Drink from 2016."
US,91,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Paul Dolan 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino County),"The smell of new leather and cigar box continues right into the flavors of this deep-colored, densely textured, quite tannic and full-bodied wine. That funky vein meets deep fruit flavors like black currants, so those who like a little adventure in their wine will love it."
US,91,38,Chardonnay,white,Gary Farrell 2010 Westside Farms Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A very good wine from one of the newer entries to the Farrell pantheon of vineyard-designated Chardonnays. It's brisk in acidity, with voluptuous tropical fruit and green apple flavors. New oak brings the usual complexities of buttered toast and vanilla. The texture is just a little scoury. Drink now."
US,85,22,Pinot Gris,white,14 Hands 2013 The Reserve Pinot Gris (Horse Heaven Hills),Aromas suggest green apple and melon. This wine drinks dry with a lightly spritzy feel but the flavor concentration seems lacking.
US,87,22,Pinot Noir,red,Babcock 2009 Rita's Earth Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"A lighter style of Pinot Noir, but lovely for drinking now. It has flavors of tea, cola, strawberry jam and dusty spices, and is dry and silky. Fresh and easy, at a good price."
US,86,14,Merlot,red,Heron 2012 Merlot (Mendocino County),"Medium-bodied and well-priced for the quality, this Merlot is herbal in cassis and red cherry flavors, on the elegant side of the spectrum, and relatively low in alcohol. The tannins are firm and mellowed, the finish just fine."
US,86,10,Pinot Noir,red,Peltier 2014 Hybrid Pinot Noir (Lodi),Good balance and slightly lean fruit and spice flavors make an agreeable combo in this medium-bodied and nicely tangy wine. Whiffs of cinnamon and earth go with cherry and rhubarb flavors.
US,93,29,Syrah,red,William James 2009 Hampton Family Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Jumping out of the glass with intoxicating aromas of cracked cherry cordials, this wine comes from the small production of Robin Bogue, whose father, Bill Bogue, is a well-known vineyard consultant. Flavors start with grilled meatiness, slowly slip to licorice on the midpalate and finish between vanilla and leather. Altogether a richly nuanced and deeply luscious wine."
US,90,32,Zinfandel,red,McCay Cellars 2010 Trulux Zinfandel (Lodi),"McCay's Westside Zin, Trulux, opens with a strong bouquet of red and black fruit along with a suggestion of anise. Inviting, it's structured and smooth in tannins, with a bite of oak on the finish. Earthy and with great acidity throughout, it makes for a great food wine."
Italy,87,17,Riesling,white,Peter Zemmer 2012 Rohracker Riesling (Alto Adige),"Aromas of beeswax, lychee and fragrant white flowers take center stage in this wine. The juicy palate offers ripe Bartlett pear and lemon drop alongside fresh acidity."
Italy,88,45,Sangiovese,red,Castiglion del Bosco 2010  Brunello di Montalcino,"Aromas of exotic spice, vanilla, plum and oak characterize this concentrated Brunello. The palate offers dark berry, coconut, toasted oak and dried sage alongside assertive tannins that leave a drying finish."
US,91,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Passing Time 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"Cabernet from Discovery (43%) and Champoux (43%) vineyards make up the heart of this wine, with dollops of Klipsun Merlot and Champoux Cabernet Franc. Pungent aromas of blackberry, herb and earth lead to sweet black cherry and blackberry flavors that show sophistication. The sense of balance is compelling. It's very pretty, a thinking person's Cabernet."
Italy,87,20,Red Blend,red,Castello di Meleto 2010  Chianti Classico,"This straightforward selection has aromas of violet, plum and light toast. The palate offers ripe, black fruit and pepper flavors, partnered with brisk acidity and firm tannins."
Italy,91,33,Red Blend,red,Rocca di Frassinello 2008 Le Sughere di Frassinello  (Maremma),"This edition of Le Sughere di Frassinello shows impressive softness and richness, with round tones of red cherry, chocolate, spice, leather and tobacco. It's soft, luscious and very smooth on the finish."
US,89,15,Pinot Noir,red,Samuel Robert 2015 Vintner's Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This wine is lively and spicy, with cranberry and cherry flavors, juicy acidity and a strong impression of citrus. The tannins are firm and balanced, with a hint of stem showing through the finish."
Italy,90,40,Sangiovese,red,La Braccesca 2012 Vigneto Santa Pia Riserva  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"Coconut, baked plum and French oak aromas come together in the glass. The taut, medium-bodied palate offers red cherry fruit with hints of toast, espresso and star anise, framed by fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020."
US,88,30,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,:Nota Bene 2012 Una Notte Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Grenache makes up nearly three-quarters of this blend, with the rest Syrah and Mourvèdre. Bright raspberry, cranberry, rose hip and white pepper aromas lead to elegant yet high octane fruit flavors that taper toward the warm finish."
US,90,25,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Cosa Obra 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Coast),"Lively acidity wraps itself around fresh notions of grapefruit, gooseberry and peach in this fuller, richer style of white. French oak played a part in both fermentation and aging, adding a luxurious undercurrent of texture and complexity."
US,86,23,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Olema 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"This soft, simple wine, with small touches of Malbec and Petit Verdot, delivers sizable tannin atop notable acidity. Tart red currant and cherry meet cedar and a taste of toffee, allowing for a pleasantness on the palate that's rich and ripe."
US,86,59,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,"The Dancing Fox 2012 Lewis Vineyards, Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)","Made in an obviously oaky style, this has spicy, smoky vanilla and nutmeg aromas, plus equally high-intensity and almost sweet flavors. A relatively smooth texture accompanies the full body. Generous and ripe fruit flavors come out with each sip and add depth."
US,86,10,Zinfandel,red,Fetzer 1999 Valley Oaks Zinfandel (California),"Sprightly and clean, with full-throttle fruit and spice and a softly tannic texture. The pepper and wild-berry flavors are distinctive and delicious, and nicely dry. Try with pizza, or pasta with spicy sausages. Best Buy."
France,86,28,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Eric Louis 2014 Domaine Curot  (Sancerre),"The 24-acre Domaine Curot is at Thauvenay close to the Loire. This wine is attractive and soft. Apples and ripe pears dominate, with a fresh citrus streak. It's ready to drink."
US,87,20,Riesling,white,Paumanok 2014 Semi Dry Riesling (North Fork of Long Island),Ripe peach and yellow cherry aromas take a turn towards the tropics on the palate of this intensely fruity wine. It's semi-dry in style with a slightly candied tone but balanced neatly by tart lemon­-lime acidity. Drink now.
US,90,33,Pinot Noir,red,Laelaps 2014 Nemarniki Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Warm, round and full-flavored, this is packed with in-your-face flavors of cooked strawberries, blackberries and cherry-pie filling. The explosion of rich ripe fruit is captivating, and though it may not be right for long term cellaring, it's ready right now and most enjoyable. Drink now through 2020."
US,90,40,Pinot Noir,red,Chasseur 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Light and earthy, with welcoming aromas of forest floor and black tea, this is a wisp of wine, delicate and soft, lightly spicy and enjoyable. Cherry and raspberry round out its profile, an elegant representation of Russian River Valley Pinot."
Italy,92,45,Red Blend,red,Castello Vicchiomaggio 2011 La Prima Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),"Elegantly structured, this opens with aromas of dried berry, ground pepper, grilled herb and a cedar note. On the firm palate, notes of licorice, ground pepper and sage add depth to the core of dried black cherry. Firm, fine-grained tannins provide the backbone."
US,89,20,Pinot Noir,red,Fire and Oak 2012 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"This shows red cherry fruit accented by a black sage and sweet pine twist on the nose. It's rich and spicy once sipped, with clove, cinnamon, gingerbread and other Christmas spices giving character to the red- and black-cherry fruits."
Italy,91,35,Chardonnay,white,Ferrari 2006 Perlé Chardonnay (Trento),"Here's a lovely sparkling wine from northern Italy, with enticing aromas of freshly baked cookies, almond and apple. The palate is creamy, with a smooth texture and elegant perlage, offering flavors of ripe apple, lemon-cream pie, vanilla and bread crust, all lifted by crisp acidity."
US,86,50,Merlot,red,Twomey 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Nice and dry, with a good bite of firm tannins, but it's a little flat in the flavor profile. Shows decent cherry, berry, herb and cedar flavors that could be more vibrant and complex. But it is elegantly structured."
US,86,20,Pinot Noir,red,Bishop's Peak 2011 Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"This wine is from Talley, and while it's nowhere near as good as the parent company's Pinot Noir, it's not bad for the price. Shows a nice, silky texture with bright, juicy flavors of cherries, cranberries and toast."
US,91,42,Pinot Noir,red,Panthea 2012 Filigreen Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This is a muscular, full-bodied wine showing a nice mix of savory and fruity flavors. A fantastic lively texture of firm acidity and fine tannins come with a lip-smacking freshness that's hard to ignore. The balance and complexity are very attractive and promise versatility with a wide variety of foods."
France,95,95,Pinot Noir,red,Louis Jadot 2005 Les Baudes Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),"This is a wonderful wine, very ripe, the blackberry and sweet fruits all here, While the tannins are solid and concentrated, they are in the center of a lush, beautifully rich series of flavors that range from fruit to licorice to spice. The wine shows great aging potential."
Italy,85,60,Red Blend,red,Volpaiole 2006 Red (Val di Cornia Suvereto),"There's a muddled or confused quality to this blend of Sangiovese (50%), Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Although the nose needs deciphering, the mouthfeel is clean, fruit-driven and tight."
US,90,25,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Twomey 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Brilliant acidity gives this wine a clean raciness that so many Sauvignon Blancs lack. It has ripe, forward flavors of lemons, limes, apricots, peaches and honey, but despite the richness is dry and minerally."
France,91,26,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Peymouton 2010  Saint-Émilion,"A powerful, firm wine, very solid and rich. With red plum and blackberry fruits, dense tannins and a touch of wood aging, the wine shows considerable potential. It is already balanced but will benefit from at least six years' aging."
Italy,87,15,Red Blend,red,Zenato 2016  Valpolicella Superiore,"Made with 85% Corvina, 10% Rondinella and 5% Corvinone, this opens with aromas of red-skinned berry, clove and a hint of smoke. The savory, easy-drinking palate offers red currant, raspberry jam and white pepper. It's meant to be enjoyed young so drink soon."
Italy,86,40,Red Blend,red,Cantina Valpolicella Negrar 2009 Domini Veneti  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"This has bright aromas of red currant, cherry and red pepper. The palate isn't very expressive, but it does show some prune and raisin notes, along with a hint of chocolate. It could use a bit more freshness and length, and you'll detect the alcohol. Drink soon."
France,91,30,Syrah,red,Dauvergne & Ranvier 2009 Vin Rare  (Crozes-Hermitage),"This selection shows pure black-cherry fruit on the nose, then it folds in hints of flowers, spices, chocolate and coffee on the palate. It's full bodied and creamy in texture without being heavy, then finishes long. Ready to drink, but should easily hold another 5–6 years."
US,88,32,Merlot,red,Russell Creek 2000 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This has sharp, cedary oak dominating the fruit right now. The fruit is good, solid black cherry, but it is not quite big enough to tackle all that new oak, though some bottle time will help. Good, ambitious winemaking. —P.G."
France,85,15,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château la Verrière 2016  Bordeaux Blanc,"This wine is crisp, taut and with a strong mineral texture. Spice and green-fruit flavors are shot through with acidity and have a steely edge. Hold the wine until late 2017 for it to soften."
US,87,25,Merlot,red,Canoe Ridge 2005 Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills),"Surprising scents of clover and mint rise up from the glass, leading into a round, fruity, substantial wine with good cherry fruit and some earthy tannins from the 5% Cabernet Franc in the blend. The wine has not completely knit together, but a good steak could fix that."
France,85,14,Pinot Noir,red,Hubert Meyer NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace),Cherry and wild strawberry flavors dominate this fruity wine. It is very fresh with intense acidity and a crisp aftertaste. A few months more in bottle would help it soften.
US,87,16,White Blend,white,Montinore 2015 Borealis The Northern Whites White (Willamette Valley),"The so-called Northern Whites are Gewürztraminer, Müller-Thurgau, Pinot Gris and Riesling. They make a comfortable blend, with floral aromas and plump peach and apple fruit. Though finished dry, it has appealing fruit sweetness."
France,84,43,Chardonnay,white,Georges Duboeuf 2014 Le Clos Devouluet Durand-les-Verchès  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"Smooth and generous, this wine is soft and missing any bite. It is round and unfocused, but ready to drink now."
US,87,15,Pinot Grigio,white,Brassfield 2006 High Serenity Ranch Pinot Grigio (High Valley),"Brassfield is establishing a fine track record with this wine. It's wonderfully crisp and clean in acidity, with pure flavors of citrus fruits, lemongrass, apricots, wildflowers and white pepper. Fine as an aperitif sipper, or with almost anything that wants a dry, zesty white."
France,90,22,Riesling,white,Vieil Armand 2009 Château Ollwiller Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Riesling that is just becoming mature is the foundation of this perfumed, white fruit and complex wine. Dried apricot and spice cake flavors give the wine richness and balance the fruitiness that is now maturing. Drink this fine wine now."
US,83,20,Red Blend,red,Tarara 2013 Long Bomb Edition Seven Red (Virginia),"Stewed berries mix with sweet spice aromas of anise and vanilla on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Syrah and Tannat. The light-bodied palate is streamlined and focused on watery strawberry and red cherry flavors riding over underripe green notes."
US,87,16,Pinot Grigio,white,Terra d'Oro 2015 Pinot Grigio (Santa Barbara County),"The nose on this bottling is bright, fresh and clean, with lots of apple, Key lime and squeezed-citrus touches. Snappy pear flavors show first on the sip, then come riper yellow peach and cantaloupe, all framed by jubilant acidity. There's nothing too complex, but it's a refreshing sipper."
US,92,56,Pinot Noir,red,Matrix 2009 Reserve Nunes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Deeply flavored in raspberries, cherries, red licorice and exotic dusty spices, this Pinot Noir has a tannin-acid tightness that makes it aloof and hard. Although it's dry, it's so rich in fruit, it tastes sweet. A very fine wine, but needs some time to come around. Give it four or five years to mellow."
US,92,84,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Chateau Margene 2014 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"This bottling, which is balanced by 16% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot, rides the savory edge of the grape, with aromas of underbrush and dried herbs giving depth to the black-olive and black-currant aromas. The palate offers a mix of red and darker fruits, including cranberry, plum and blackberry, with touches of thyme and anise."
US,88,55,Red Blend,red,Roblar 2013 Sangre de Dioses Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"Red currant, black cherries and a touch of dried oregano show on this blend of 60% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot, and 10% Grenache. The mouthfeel is quite full of flavor although relatively medium-bodied, with red cherry and blackberry fruit flavors cut by a pencil lead minerality. Easy to quaff and quite hedonistic."
US,86,19,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Shenandoah Vineyards 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Shenandoah Valley),"At the start, this smells like dark fruit and toast drizzled with molten beeswax. The flavors mirror the aromas, with a hefty hint of clove that stipples the textured finish."
US,90,69,Pinot Noir,red,Acacia 2013 Lone Tree Pinot Noir (Carneros),"From an estate property, this is among the winery's top bottlings every year. In this stellar vintage it shows well in a mix of cranberry and dense earth. Tightly wound and still a touch chewy in tannin weight, the oak is present yet integrated, allowing the ripe fruit to shine."
France,92,94,Riesling,white,René Muré 2009 Vorbourg Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives Riesling (Alsace),"It's impressive how much honey flavor laced with lemon acidity there is in this wine. The pairing gives the sweetness a wonderful focus, coming to a point of freshness, leaving a delicious, lifted aftertaste. Age for 4–6 years."
US,86,17,Red Blend,red,Fabbioli Cellars 2013 Amici & Amanti Red (Virginia),"A little more than half Chambourcin, this red blend including Merlot, Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot makes up this vibrant, fruit-forward red. Juicy red and black berries meet tart cranberries on a medium-bodied, soft palate. A slight tannic grip on the finish balances it all out, making this wine a perfect choice for late-summer barbecues."
US,93,50,Pinot Noir,red,Lucienne 2013 Smith Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Smoked beef, tart cherries and dark berries show on the inviting nose of this hearty bottling from winemaker Paul Clifton. The palate is both heavy duty and elegant, with blackberry and black-cherry fruit resting on a spicy backbone of ginger, clove, bay leaf and aromatic chocolate, leaving the tongue singing for quite a while."
Italy,90,70,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Castello di Querceto 2003 Il Sole di Alessandro Cabernet Sauvignon (Colli della Toscana Centrale),"Thick and powerful, this pure Cabernet boasts a wide offering of aromas: Plum, prune, wild mushroom, moist earth and mature fruit are identifiable characteristics. The mouthfeel is gritty and raw but full of penetrating flavors."
US,92,44,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Woodward Canyon 2005 Artist Series #14 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is taut and dense, and requires time and air to untangle. Deep, dark fruits are mixed in with layers of black olive, smoke, compost, tar, moist earth and herb—a delicious mélange of flavors that promises good things to come as the wine ages. It's masterful winemaking in a package so young and wrapped up tight that it may pass you by if you don't give it a good look."
US,91,70,Merlot,red,Sterling 1999 Reserve Merlot (Napa Valley),"Here's a big-boned beauty of a Merlot. Impresses with the sheer size of its fruity-berry flavors and lovely, rich tannins. A layer of well-smoked oak overlays everything. This is a flamboyant wine and will reward careful cellaring."
US,88,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Hart 2 Hart 2014 Romantique Harmony Pilot Ridge Vineyard Estate Grown Red (El Dorado),"Vivid berry flavors drive this medium-bodied, lively and firmly tannic wine. It has good acidity that combines with the fine-grained tannins for an especially tangy mouthfeel."
US,85,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hogue 2005 Terroir Champoux Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"Reductive, with strong rubber ball scents; lying just below are raspberry and the classic Champoux cherry fruit. There is a thinness that seems to emphasize the high tones, the volatility and the alcohol; the fruit lacks flesh. Maybe with more airing/decanting this would fill out. Tasting room exclusive."
France,93,128,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine René Bouvier 2011 Les Fontenys Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),"This firm wine has structure as well as enticing sweet red berry fruits. Dynamic and fruity, it has a dark structure that impressively expresses this solid terroir. Drink from 2018."
US,90,18,Sangiovese,red,Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley),"This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine."
US,86,44,Chardonnay,white,Dutton Estate 2014 Dutton Palms Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A baked lemon, honeyed aspect of this wine makes it seem overripe in many ways, a lush, full-bodied characteristic that seems slightly overdone. From one of the farming family's Green Valley ranches, it's intense and creamy."
US,89,30,Pinot Noir,red,Thomas Fogarty 2009 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Fogarty's basic Pinot Noir is very good, although it's not a wine for aging. With its soft dryness and rich tannins, it shows polished flavors of cherries, cola, herbs, cinnamon spice and subtle oak."
Italy,89,90,Red Blend,red,Galardi 2013 Terra di Lavoro Red (Campania),"Aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, prune, tobacco, earth and Asian spice float out of the glass. The subdued but refined palate offers mature plum, blackberry, cocoa and cinnamon alongside polished, fine-grained tannins. It has soft appeal but is already evolved and short on intensity and verve. It will, however, make enjoyable drinking over the next few years."
US,89,15,Chardonnay,white,Kenwood 1999 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"This ripe, lovely wine shows classic Russian River Valley aromas of ripe, sweet, green apples. The winemaking adds smoky, vanilla-scented oak, a creamy, leesy smoothness and a rich softness that owes to malolactic fermentation. What strikes you, though, is the balance. All the parts come together in this super-enjoyable wine. At this price, it's a great value."
US,83,24,Chardonnay,white,Bedarra 2009 Reserve Chardonnay (Dry Creek Valley),"With lots of sweet oak, this is a simple Chardonnay. It's marked by buttered toast, caramel, vanilla and pineapple jam flavors that will appeal to fans of this ripe California style."
Italy,90,35,Syrah,red,Domenico Cavazza 2009 Cicogna Syrah (Veneto),"You don't see much Syrah from the Veneto in northeast Italy, but Cicogna shows that the variety does have a future here. This expression is soft and plump with ripe fruit, blackberry, leather and tobacco. There's a point of bright freshness on the long finish."
US,87,18,Chardonnay,white,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2009 Estate Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),"This is a good wine to drink if you want a modestly elegant Chardonnay to serve alongside food, instead of a big, oaky sweetie. It's dry and crisp and clean, with pleasantly rich flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, green apples, minerals and vanilla. Easy to find, with 17,000 cases produced."
France,86,14,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Rousset-Caillau 2014  Entre-Deux-Mers,"Green fruits and an herbal character give this wine brightness and freshness, balanced by riper tropical fruits that come in with their softer edge. Still young, the wine is ready to drink now although is likely to be better from summer 2016."
US,89,35,Syrah,red,Wrath 2007 877/Noir Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is a generous, likable Syrah for drinking soon. It's dark in color, full-bodied and dry, with ripe flavors of blackberries, plums, cola, anise, sandalwood and peppery spices. The soft tannins help the wine finish rich and silky."
US,85,25,Pinot Noir,red,Wente 2005 Reliz Creek Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco),"A silky, lightweight Pinot Noir that brings some herbal notes to its modest cherry aromas. Flavors are sweetly fruity, combining cherry and plum with hints of brown sugar before an abbreviated finish."
US,92,22,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Andrew Rich 2014 Croft Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Willamette Valley),"This delicious wine makes you wish that a lot more Sauv Blanc was coming out of the Willamette Valley. It's sharp, spicy and bright. The grapefruit and pineapple flavors carry well-defined accents of herb and pine needle. The pinpoint acidity adds further focus."
US,90,70,Pinot Noir,red,De Loach 2013 Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Bedecked with a large gold fleur-de-lis on the bottle, this wine is showy in flavor too, a rich, ripe celebration of California exuberance, full bodied in cranberry, cherry, orange and blackberry fruitiness."
Italy,87,17,Syrah,red,Valle dell'Acate 2007 Case Ibidini Syrah (Sicilia),"Here's a young, fruity and easygoing expression of Syrah with aromas of crushed blueberries and chalky mineral nuances. The wine has good density and berry flavors, making for an approachable and correct companion to stay-home dinners."
US,89,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Spring Valley Vineyard 2013 Frederick Estate Grown Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Cabernet Sauvignon (80%) makes up the majority of this wine, with the rest equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Aromas of high-toned green herbs, spice, black cherry and blackberry lead to lively cranberry and cherry flavors. It shows a sense of freshness, though at times it seems a bit green."
Italy,91,20,White Blend,white,Pieropan 2001 Calvarino  (Soave Classico Superiore),"Not your grandmother's Soave, this is fully loaded, from its charming, fresh aromas of peaches and orange blossoms to its plump, fleshy flavors of stone fruits. And it's all backed by bracing acidity that keeps the ripe flavors lively right through the long, minerally finish. Editors' Choice."
US,86,28,White Blend,white,Marianello 2012 Estelle Bianco White (Santa Barbara County),"Grass and apple-flesh notes are wrapped in a slightly reductive, oily frame on this blend of 55% Sauvignon Blanc, 18% Loureiro, 15% Verdelho, 7% Grenache Blanc and 5% Chardonnay. The flavors are also a tad tarry, with green-apple peels, lime zest, candied pear and dried grapefruit."
Italy,92,41,Red Blend,red,Podere Guado al Melo 2007  Bolgheri Superiore,"This Bolgheri Superiore shows luscious and clean notes of mature black fruit, plum, prune and loads of vibrant black cherry. Wood elements of spice, tobacco and leather are well integrated and the wine is impressively smooth and generous on the finish."
US,87,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Goyette 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"This shows lots of blackberry and currant flavors, along with a polished jacket of smoky oak. It's bone dry but a little heavy. Perfect for easy drinking when you need a nice Cabernet and don't want to mortgage the house."
France,92,80,Chardonnay,white,Olivier Leflaive 2009 Vaudésir Grand Cru  (Chablis),"Powerful, concentrated Chablis. It is rich, with ripe apricot and nectarine fruit, laced with Seville orange acidity. With a touch of toast, a well-integrated structure, this is a wine for medium-term aging."
US,91,40,Chardonnay,white,Buty 2013 Conner Lee Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine brings aromas of pineapple, lemon drop, chamomile tea and custard to the bouquet. The flavors are ripe and full, showing a sense of texture and weight followed by a persistent finish."
US,94,70,Pinot Noir,red,Gary Farrell 2012 Rochioli Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The producer continues to hit it out of the park with this vintage of Pinot, offering a gorgeously balanced interpretation of a marquee vineyard site. Rose petal and lavender aromas evolve into flavors of rosemary, high-toned orange peel, dried cherry and cranberry on the palate, keeping things ethereal throughout. Smooth and medium bodied, the tannins are coy and the entire experience memorable."
US,87,60,Red Blend,red,Jack Nicklaus Wines 2009 Private Reserve Red (Napa Valley),"This is a Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux-style blend with a splash of Syrah. It's made in the modern cult style of softness, extracted fruit and plenty of toasty oak. With blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors, it's obviously delicious, yet has a certain generic quality. Drink now."
France,91,50,Pinot Gris,white,Jean-Baptiste Adam 2014 Letzenberg Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Warm, shimmering notes of ripe pear fill nose and palate. This generous fruit is countered by citric freshness on this dry, almost slender wine that pulls off a lovely balance and softness without losing its definition."
Italy,91,22,Sangiovese,red,Cantalici L'Antica Fornace di Ridolfo 2013 Baruffo  (Chianti Classico),"Underbrush, moist soil, menthol and woodland berry aromas unfold in the glass. The structured palate offers ripe black cherry, raspberry, licorice and a hint of mocha alongside fine-grained tannins and bright acidity."
US,85,40,Merlot,red,Firestone 2012 The Chairman Series Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),"There's not much overt fruit on the nose of this wine, which instead shows plenty of papilla chile and bell-pepper elements. The body is light and peppery, proving easy to sip with red fruit and peppercorns, leading into a vanilla-kissed finish."
US,90,32,Syrah,red,JM Cellars 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Bright and spicy, this delightful Syrah has the cherry and boysenberry flavors, and the spice and lift of Washington fruit, with a finish that leads gracefully into pepper and coffee grounds. It's lively and palate-cleansing, with a finish that mixes citrusy lemon with dry, herbal tannins."
Italy,95,175,Red Blend,red,Monteverro 2008 Red (Toscana),"This represents a debut vintage from a brand new estate in a little-known corner of southern Tuscany made with consultant Michel Rolland. The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot and the results are savory and delicious, with lingering tones of blackberry, rum cake, spice and leather."
US,88,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Gundlach Bundschu 2014 Mountain Cuvée Red (Sonoma County),"This hearty blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller amounts of Malbec and Petit Verdot is a great go-to wine for a crowd. Cabernet leads the way with cedar, cranberry and tobacco notes, clipped by sizable tannin. As it opens, layers of dense raspberry and vanilla flavors unfurl."
US,85,30,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Uptick Vineyards 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),"The majority of the grapes for this white that's musky on the nose was stainless-steel fermented, with 20% given time in neutral French oak. The combination provides easygoing texture, accented by notes of grass and herb. A fleck of stone fruit and papaya tease midpalate before an abbreviated finish."
US,92,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cornerstone 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Everything about this Cabernet argues for cellaring. With a little Merlot and Cabernet Franc, it's enormously complex, with fruit flavors that range from blackberries and cherries to black currants. There's also a pleasant herbaceousness that suggests sweet green peas. The tannins are significant, so let it develop bottle complexity until 2016."
US,92,39,Syrah,red,Prospect 772 2014 The Brawler Syrah (Calaveras County),"Lavishly, densely ripe and fruity, this big, juicy wine has everything in spades, from the nearly black color to the jammy, dessert-like aromas to the saturated blackberry and black fig flavors to a full, opulent body and richly tannic texture. It sure packs a lot of power into each sip."
France,89,20,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Lavau 2015 La Decelle Red,"This medium-bodied blend of 50% Grenache and 50% Syrah is simple but satisfying. Ripe cherries and raspberries carry the load, dressed up by hints of vanilla and cinnamon. A soft dustiness marks the texture, turning silky on the finish. Drink now–2020."
US,88,42,Zinfandel,red,Lamborn Family Vineyards 2008 Frosty Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"Here's a delicious Zinfandel to drink now. It's very rich in wild raspberry and cherry fruit, sweet tobacco, bacon and spice flavors, wrapped into thick but gentle tannins. Alcohol is high, but in balance."
US,91,50,Pinot Noir,red,ZD 2013 45th Anniversary Pinot Noir (Carneros),"A full-bodied, heady and velvety wine, this discloses a strong grip on the palate, surrounded by notes of allspice and earth. A slight tartness of spice and smoke complement rich tones of cherry and wild strawberry, finishing robustly. Drink now through 2020."
US,86,44,Pinot Noir,red,Marimar Estate 2013 Mas Cavalls Doña Margarita Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is an estate-grown wine from a vineyard planted to three clones. It has an air of forested truffle, pine and cinnamon within a stemmy and somewhat unresolved body of medium weight."
US,87,17,Merlot,red,Kenwood 1998 Merlot (Sonoma County),"Enough berry and plum richness and smoky oak to satisfy fussy drinkers, yet dry and compact, with a nice shine of acidity. Not too complex or subtle, but there's plenty to like about it. Should be easy to find with more than 30,000 cases produced."
US,88,35,Pinot Noir,red,J Vineyards & Winery 2015 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This tart, plush and broadly appealing wine is fruit-forward and rounded with red cherry, cola and vanilla flavors."
France,88,11,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Dourthe 2009 La Grande Cuvée  (Bordeaux Blanc),"Crisp and also creamy, this is a soft, ripe wine that also preserves good acidity. It shows the freshness of 2009, while also bringing out a richly herbaceous character."
France,94,125,Pinot Noir,red,Alex Gambal 2013 Aux Échanges Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),"Aux Echanges is one of the smallest Premier Crus in Chambolle on the northern end close to Morey Saint-Denis, an area that gives a firm character to the wine. The structure is all there with some solid tannins although the wine also has superripe red fruits that are delicious and jammy. Full in the mouth, it is still young, so drink from 2019."
US,87,12,Pinot Noir,red,Tortoise Creek 2015 Mission Grove Pinot Noir (California),"Attractive floral aromas and bright cherry and raspberry flavors make a light, refreshing impression. This medium-bodied wine has light tannins and lively acidity in the texture."
Italy,87,24,Pinot Grigio,white,Russiz Superiore 2008 Pinot Grigio (Collio),"Creamy and smooth with a dense and sophisticated style, this is the kind of top-shelf Pinot Grigio you could pair with lobster bisque or New England clam chowder. There are pretty aromas here of yellow flower, acacia, peach, pear and citrus."
US,97,135,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Janzen 2009 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This wine will divide aficionados. Some will find it too soft and fruity. Others will marvel at its sheer deliciousness. It's fantastically rich, a wine of deliriously decadent flavors, ranging from blackberry jam and crème de cassis to mocha, blueberry extract and buttered cinnamon toast. Yes, it's soft, but it's the softness of fine velvet. After all that richness, the finish is amazingly dry. Drink over the next few years to enjoy its youthful beauty."
US,91,30,Red Blend,red,Gorman 2009 Zachary's Ladder Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"It's labeled simply Columbia Valley but in fact it's made from all Red Mountain fruit. Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon dominant, with a splash of Petit Verdot, this is quite ripe and sweetly juicy—like a big bowl of blackberries. Aged in once-used French oak, it has picked up some char and graphite notes."
Italy,85,15,Red Blend,red,Sant'Andrea in Colle 2013  Chianti Classico,"Fresh and simple, this opens with aromas that recall blackberry and dark spice. The aromas carry over to the easy palate along with a note of orange zest offset by firm acidity and loose knit tannins."
Italy,86,13,Red Blend,red,Gorgo 2005 Podere Monte Maggiore  (Bardolino Classico Superiore),This is an unassuming and easy red from the shores of Italy's beautiful Lake Garda that offers cherry fruit and loads of exotic spice. Its color is ruby red with bright highlights and it offers sour cherry flavors with some bitterness on the close.
US,88,18,Chardonnay,white,Chamisal Vineyards 2016 Stainless Chardonnay (Central Coast),"This popular bottling offers the tropical fruit salad array it always has, with honeydew, cantaloupe, pineapple, guava and banana aromas. Yet, this particular vintage has a refreshing zestiness. Steely structure and lime-like acidity drive the palate, balancing its buttercream and peach custard flavors."
US,87,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Martin Ray 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa-Mendocino-Sonoma),"Here's a good, rich Cabernet for drinking now. It satisfies for the elaborate layers of blackberries, cherries and plums, enhanced with spicy, smoky oak. Full-bodied and tannic, it shows lots of elegant complexity for the price."
France,89,65,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Brown 2006  Pessac-Léognan,"With its high percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon (60%), this gives an initial serious structure, topped with rich, ripe black fruit flavors. The tannins are calmed by this richness, with spice, blueberries and blackberry juice much more dominant."
US,87,12,Zinfandel,red,Z-52 2006 Zinfandel (Lodi),"A great buy at this price for its richness and overall integrity. Has a medium body, with fine, fuzzy tannins and bone-dry, complex flavors of wild berries, currants, herbs, tobacco and tons of peppery spices."
US,91,36,Red Blend,red,Elsom Cellars 2009 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Interesting highlights of English Breakfast tea and toasted grains complement the strawberry fruit in this blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 46% Malbec and 8% Syrah. Layered and complex, it shows pleasing hints of lightly composted earth."
US,88,15,Pinot Noir,red,MooBuzz 2012 Pinot Noir (Monterey),"Deep black raspberry and slate make for a traditional nose on this solid-deal wine. It's refreshing and lively once sipped, with dark red fruits and a bit of brown spice."
France,89,18,Red Blend,red,Château Laurou 2013 Les Complices Red (Fronton),"Half-and-half Négrette and Syrah, this is typical blend for Fronton with its hints of the Mediterranean mixed in with a more Atlantic influence. The wine is soft and balanced with dusty tannins, red fruits and a perfumed aftertaste. Drink now."
US,87,8,Riesling,white,Hogue 2010 Late Harvest Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Labeled late harvest, but not terribly sweet, this includes small amounts of Muscat, Gewürztraminer and Chenin Blanc in the blend. Lemony with both citrus rind and sweet candy flavors, it's a useful, off-dry wine with a slightly sugary finish."
France,90,50,Merlot,red,Château Marsau 2014  Francs Côtes de Bordeaux,"A structured wine from the Chadronnier family, it is full of tannins and also full of sweeping black-fruit flavors. It is perfumed, rich and concentrated. Don't drink until at least 2020 to get the full generosity of the wine."
France,92,35,Riesling,white,Domaine de la Tour Blanche 2015 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),Blossom and citrus inform the nose—white jasmine hovers alongside grapefruit and orange. The palate is juicy and full of bouncy easy fruit on a fluid dryish body. Bright lemon freshness makes the fruit flavors even more vivid. The balance between fruit and freshness gives this tension and makes it very moreish. The finish is clean and orange scented.
US,90,58,Pinot Noir,red,Rex Hill 2011 Old School Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This cuvée offers interesting complexity, with black cherry, wood smoke, cedar shake and a whiff of bacon fat. It's tannic and stiff, a bit hard to unwrap, but far from a simple wine. It will reward your patience, whether you give it extra breathing time, or tuck it away in the cellar for a few years."
US,89,45,Pinot Noir,red,Cebada 2011 Pinot Noir (Santa Ynez Valley),"Sandalwood, hibiscus and grapeseed aromas converge on the nose of this wine that comes from a vineyard just west of the Sta. Rita Hills. The palate shows barely ripe raspberry fruit, a touch of grassiness and a spicing of anise seed, proving quite light and vibrant even at four years old."
France,86,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Saransot-Dupré 2014  Listrac-Médoc,"Situated to the north of the village of Listrac, this estate is one of several that carries the name Dupré. The wine is dominated by Merlot (60%). That explains the wine's high alcohol and lush character. It also shows signs of firm extraction that has left a tough dry core. It will soften, but it will not lose its overwhelming richness."
France,86,23,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Domaine Grier 2009 Odyssea Red (Côtes du Roussillon),"This is a bright and approachable wine, with forward notes of blueberry, plum and wild strawberry accented by hints of garrigue and vanilla. Swaths of mocha and sweet spice add richness to the palate and linger on the medium-length finish."
US,90,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Whitehall Lane 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This lush, attractive Cabernet impresses for its explosion of blackberry, cherry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are so rich and fine. It's almost sweet, but stands back at the last second, making the finish dry and spicy. A beautiful wine for drinking now and over the next 4–6 years."
US,87,15,Riesling,white,Wagner 2014 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Crisp and cutting, this zesty apple-scented wine offers loads of lemony refreshment. The palate is zippy and taut, invigorating with a clean mineral finish."
US,88,30,Zinfandel,red,Terra d'Oro 2011 Deaver Vineyard Zinfandel (Amador County),This powerful wine is sourced from 100-year-old vines in the famous Deaver vineyard. There's a touch of pepper behind the thick tannins and oak. It's a long lasting wine with leathery blackberry fruit that should come to the fore over time.
France,91,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château des Arnauds 2012 Cuvée des Capucins  (Lalande de Pomerol),"Vines with an average age of 30 years give this wine good intensity that balances the firm, dark tannins. It's a powerful, concentrated Merlot-based wine, big and generous. Ripe plums and berries show strongly through the tannic structure. Give this wine until 2017 before drinking."
US,82,20,Chardonnay,white,Standing Stone 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Though found in some Chardonnays, there's a heaviness to this wine, with its orange Muscat nose and syrupy flavors, that seems out of sync here. The wine seems to flop onto the palate and sit there, without much progression. Needs more acid and a lighter touch."
US,85,25,Merlot,red,Plaisance Ranch 2012 Merlot (Applegate Valley),"This fails to overcome its thin, unripe fruit. Strong scents of smoke and oak carry into the flavors, bringing a bitter end to the finish."
US,88,20,Pinot Noir,red,Coelho 2015 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The winery calls this their “Bunny Cuvée” due to the rabbit on the label. It's well made, of fair value, with sharp details. Cranberry and raspberry fruit flavors punch through with a gentle streak of cola. The finish comes with a hint of composted earth."
US,92,49,Chardonnay,white,Papapietro Perry 2013 Peters Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Succulent in white peach, pear and apple, this is a nicely balanced, pretty wine. It offers just the right amount of richness on the palate, with a swirl of vanilla caramel suggested in the background amid an intriguingly unexpected salty, pretzel-like finish."
France,86,23,Pinot Noir,red,Louis Max 2010 Clos la Marche  (Mercurey),"Tannins and a red berry flavor combine in this soft wine. It has the structure of the vintage, with a firm core; the fruit and acidity developing slowly. Keep for 2–3 years."
US,85,30,Merlot,red,Sweet Valley 2008 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Light fruit flavors of watermelon and strawberry, along with some thin black cherry and cola flavors are what you'll find here. This is pleasant and drinkable, but not a wine to cellar or match with any really spicy foods. A good quaffer."
US,83,8,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Butterfield Station 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"Simple and soft, with buttery citrus flavors. Would score higher, but the wine falls apart on the finish."
France,88,65,Chardonnay,white,Besserat de Bellefon NV Cuvée des Moines Brut Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (Champagne),"This is a soft, creamed apple wine, with touches of toast. It has a great lemon zest character that brings freshness as well as brilliant acidity. The finish is textured, very fresh."
US,85,19,Pinot Noir,red,River Road 2011 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This tastes bone dry and silky, and it comes with Russian River's tart acidity. The cherry and cola flavors could be more concentrated, but it does have some elegance."
US,92,42,Pinot Noir,red,Balletto 2011 Burnside Road Vineyard Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"With an alcohol reading of only 13.3%, this Pinot offers a refreshingly light alternative to darker, heavier bottlings in California. It's silky in the mouth, despite some firm tannins, with subtle, complex raspberry, red currant, tobacco, mushroom, balsam and spice flavors. Lovely now, and should have no trouble developing in the bottle over the next eight years."
France,93,58,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château la Gaffelière 2011  Saint-Émilion,"A hugely concentrated wine, it has a dark feel to it, mineral and structured. It shows spice, suggestions of the wood aging and always the ripest fruit. Drink from 2018."
Italy,86,22,White Blend,white,Paraschos 2009 Ponka White (Venezia Giulia),"This vino naturale (the wine is not filtered and has no added sulfites) opens with intense aromas of butterscotch, candied fruit, apricot and honey. The blend is Chardonnay, Sauvignon and Malvasia, and it tastes slightly oxidized overall."
US,89,90,Pinot Noir,red,Donum 2010 Reserve Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"As ripe as Donum's regular 2010 Russian River Pinot is, this reserve is even richer. It's certainly impressive for sheer power, but is too much of a good thing, flooding the mouth with so much soft, ripe, oaky raspberry and cherry flamboyance as to lose subtlety."
US,86,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Rutherford Grove 2006 Rutherford Bench Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Made in an interesting way, with no oak but aged on the lees and put through malolactic fermentation. The result is crisp, clean and tasty, if a little sweet, with citrus, fig, green melon, vanilla and spice flavors."
US,82,10,Merlot,red,Bogle 2010 Merlot (California),"Dry, tart and simple, this has a flavor of sour cherry candy. A fine wine for pouring at big parties."
US,88,28,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Franciscan 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Smooth and oaky, this value-minded wine offers varietal notes of cassis and cranberry, with traces of dried herb, cedar and pencil lead. A heftier midpalate strengthens in the glass before a long, clove-infused finish."
US,89,32,Chardonnay,white,Carter Estate 2012 Blanc de Blanc Chardonnay (South Coast),"Tight and fresh aromas of Asian pear, honeysuckle and key lime pie converge on this sparkler from a new estate in Temecula. The palate shows sliced apples, yellow pears, ripe nectarine, rounder white peach and even creamy cherimoya flavors. Though the region is known more for almond-flavored sparklers, they seem to do regular bubbles well."
US,87,21,Chardonnay,white,Mount Eden Vineyards 2010 Wolff Vineyard Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"A well-balanced Chardonnay, this has flavors of tropical fruit, apricot and lemon candy, brightened by that famous Edna Valley acidity. This would make for a great apéritif."
US,92,85,Red Blend,red,Cayuse 2014 Camaspelo Red (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"The aromas are light, with notes of moist earth, smoke, cassis, herb and berry. The saline and fruit flavors are silky in feel, bringing a sense of concentration and texture that keeps the interest high. There's plenty of minerality throughout along with a lengthy finish."
France,88,29,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Berthet-Bondet 2012 Chardonnay (Côtes du Jura),"The wine has toast, vanilla and pear flavors, still young and tightly closed. It needs several months to begin to open up and to show its intrinsic fruitiness and potential richness. Drink from 2015."
US,88,30,Sangiovese,red,Martin Ranch 2013 Thérèse Vineyards Dos Niñas Vineyard Sangiovese (Santa Clara Valley),"Rustic aromas of crushed rocks and chewing tobacco pair interestingly with more floral elements of rose petal, lilac and wisteria on the nose of this bottling. Coffee and tobacco flavors show on the palate, where muddy tannins present leathery flavors of dark red cherries. It shows its long barrel aging with pride."
France,93,125,Pinot Noir,red,Maison Champy 2006  Mazis-Chambertin,"A dense, almost heavy wine, with smoky, licorice flavors that dominate the fruit. It is firm, big, solid, the sort of wine that demands attention with its concentration and powered structure. It may need time for aging, but already the power and weight are there."
US,91,52,Pinot Noir,red,Rex Hill 2011 Alloro Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Since last reviewed in 2008, the Alloro Vineyard's grapes seem to have gained in complexity and sophistication. Elegant and fine tuned, this new release combines scents and accents of rose petals, wet rock and raspberries with generous, supporting acidity. The finish extends gracefully with the finesse of Premier Cru Burgundy."
US,84,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Mill Creek 2005 Kreck Family Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Soft and ripe in extracted cherry and blackberry jam fruit, this also has some heat on the palate, the result of 15% alcohol. It feels a little simple, and the heat is off-putting."
US,84,21,Pinot Grigio,white,Swanson 2008 Pinot Grigio (Napa Valley),"Tastes old, even though it's only from 2008, with some oxidized notes. It's a bone-dry wine, but those citrus and flower flavors are tired."
US,85,38,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Elsom Cellars 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Cabernet blend includes about 20% Syrah in the mix, which perhaps contributes to a lack of varietal character. It seems to be in a dumb phase, with no specific aromas and nondescript fruit. The finish turns acidic and chalky."
Italy,88,16,Merlot,red,Villa Pillo 2008 Sant'Adele Merlot (Toscana),"Here's a quality Merlot offered at a very reasonable low price. Sant'Adele is rich, succulent and smooth with bursting aromas of cherry, blueberry, spice and moist tobacco. Pair this wine with homemade roast chicken and garlic potatoes."
US,85,50,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Viansa 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"A bit too soft, which makes the exceptionally ripe blackberry and chocolate flavors stand alone and lack structure. Tasty and flashy, but the palate longs for more acids and tannins."
Italy,89,69,Sangiovese,red,Castello di Verrazzano 2004 Sassello Sangiovese (Toscana),"Sassello is Sangiovese from a high hillside vineyard that offers pretty spice renderings and good dimension overall. Its blackberry, Amaretto, natural rubber and moist earth aromas and flavors offer plenty of complexity."
US,89,20,Zinfandel,red,Renwood 2012 Premier Old Vine Zinfandel (Amador County),"Very fruity and fresh but also smooth and supple, this full-bodied wine smells like ripe raspberries. Likewise, tastes recall raspberries and red cherries. and feel firm and grippy enough to counterbalance the ripeness and body. It's a very sleek but very big mouthful."
US,94,27,Pinot Noir,red,Center of Effort 2014 Effort Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"For the winery's lower-priced offering, this is a stunner. Baked black cherry, vanilla, raspberry, rose petals and a touch of licorice light up the nose. The lightly poised but intensely focused sip reveals a wild combo of fruit and spice, with sage, bay leaf, thyme and fennel laced through black cherry. It's like walking through the Central Coast scrubland."
US,85,20,Merlot,red,Simi 2005 Merlot (Sonoma County),"A solid everyday Merlot that offers plenty of ripe berry, cherry and smoky oak flavors now. Dry and tannic, it has enough stuffing and class to pair with a nice steak."
US,92,41,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cooper-Garrod 2009 George's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This patiently aged wine boasts an amazing nose of dried olallieberry fruit leather, chocolate-cherry sauce, vanilla extract and exotic black spices, showing its years in only the best ways. It's surprisingly lean on the palate at first, then evolves into red cherries and plums, with well-integrated dried oregano and black pepper spices."
France,88,40,Chardonnay,white,Louis Latour 2014 La Grande Roche Premier Cru  (Montagny),The appellation in the Côte Chalonnaise only produces white wine. This wine has a smooth and creamy character with attractive acidity and bright acidity. It is a perfumed wine just hinting at a more mineral texture. Drink from 2017.
France,94,97,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Rossignol-Trapet 2011 Petite Chapelle Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),"From vines just below the line of Grand Cru vineyards, this is a big and powerful expression of Pinot Noir. It is dense with firm tannins that are embedded in the ripe black fruits. It's a complex wine, serious while still fruity, and needing to age. Drink from  2018."
France,87,26,Sauvignon Blanc,white,François Millet 2015 Domaine des Côtes Blanches  (Sancerre),"Pure fruitiness holds the balance of this wine between crisp acidity and a tightly mineral texture. It comes from the producer's Bué vineyards, one of the top villages of Sancerre. The wine is crisp, made to be drunk young and fruity."
US,89,65,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Culton 2013 Mercenary Glenrose Vineyard Red (Paso Robles),"This blend of 50% Mourvèdre, 38% Syrah and 12% Grenache is fairly light on the nose, showing smoked beef, soy and black-plum paste. The flavors are also quite restrained, with leather, blackberry, fennel and wild-mint elements."
US,94,55,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Force Majeure 2009 Collaboration Series I Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red (Red Mountain),"Still the best wine in the lineup, this Bordeaux-style blend, made by Cadence's Ben Smith, is two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, which is sourced from some of the oldest vines on Red Mountain, planted in 1975 and 1982. Concentrated, tannic and dense, it matches the superb fruit with captivating notes of seed bread and cayenne pepper."
Italy,93,40,White Blend,white,I Sodi 2009  Vin Santo del Chianti Classico,"Made with dried grapes—67% Malvasia and 33% Trebbiano—this meditation wine opens with intense aromas of maple syrup, carob and crushed raw almond. The concentrated palate doles out dried apricot, chestnut honey and toasted hazelnut while fresh acidity balances the sweet flavors."
Italy,89,30,Sangiovese,red,Poggio Stenti 2013 Tribulo  (Montecucco),"Aromas of black cherry, tilled soil and a hint of dark spice lift out of the glass. The palate offers juicy wild cherry, cinnamon and white pepper while smooth tannins lend a polished texture."
France,88,30,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Brande-Bergère 2015 Cuvée O'Byrne  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"This is a smoky wine, with ripe berry fruits and balanced wood flavors. The solid tannins lend structure and backbone to the palate, while the finish is rich. Drink from 2018."
Italy,93,209,Sangiovese,red,Salvioni 2008  Brunello di Montalcino,"Bright cherry and blue floral aromas come with hints of leather and spice. The vibrant palate delivers succulent wild cherry and white pepper restrained by fresh acidity and bracing tannins. It has mesmerizing depth, finesse and balance. Drink 2015–2028."
US,87,38,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Hanna 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Soft in tannins and acids, this Cabernet has a gentle, drink-me-now mouthfeel. The flavors are rich and sweet in milk chocolate, blueberries and blackberries. Easy to like, if a little pricey for what you get."
France,91,30,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine Fouassier 2014 Les Romains  (Sancerre),"Grown on southwest-facing slopes, this is a ripe, full wine with a natural warmth as well as a mineral texture. It is still tight and needs to age with its gooseberry and herbal edge as well as more flinty, smoky background. Drink from 2017."
US,88,20,Chardonnay,white,Cherry Tart 2014 Chardonnay (California),"Big and flavorful, this full-bodied wine boasts butter, toast and smoke nuances layered over ripe pear and marzipan flavors. Fermented in stainless steel but aged in French oak, it has a rich texture and overt sweetness without going to extremes."
US,89,46,Pinot Noir,red,Boekenoogen 2013 3 Clone Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This clonal combo from a meticulously tended family vineyard shows iron, cranberry, strawberry blossoms, sagebrush and a wound-up minerality on the nose. Sanguine flavors power the tip of the palate alongside cranberry and pomegranate fruit. A suave spiciness of dried mint and menthol emerges in the midpalate."
France,94,580,Pinot Noir,red,Louis Latour 2014 Les Quatre Journaux  (Romanée-St.-Vivant),"A Journal is an old Burgundian measurement for just under one acre. From a portion of this Grand Cru vineyard, this wine is perfumed, powerful and has great concentration. Already it is showing dark fruits, ripe plum and good texture. Acidity cuts through the wine, giving a great lift at the end. Drink from 2022."
France,88,30,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château de Chambrun 2011  Lalande de Pomerol,This is a soft ripe wine. It has generous helpings of Merlot that give red fruit and rich acidity. The wine is soft for the vintage and is all ready to drink.
US,94,105,Pinot Noir,red,Ponzi 2014 Abetina Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Focused and dense, this intense wine captures the essence of ripe raspberries. Aged in 50% new French oak, it's got a strong vein of coffee and mocha. The flavors broaden out and penetrate, finishing with highlights of cedar, cinnamon and dark chocolate. Drink now through the 2020s, but decant if you want the full expression."
France,84,32,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Bardins 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"This wine is lean, austere with high acidity that leaves fruit well behind. It is structured and dry, only hinting at black-currant freshness. This third-generation family estate also hosts monthly musical and tasting events and sells fruit, vegetables and honey."
US,91,55,Pinot Noir,red,MacPhail 2010 Wightman House Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This explodes with ripe raspberry, strawberry and cherry flavors, while the heat from the alcohol gives it the headiness of a liqueur. It's definitely not a subtle wine, but one to enjoy now with grilled tuna, lamb or wild mushroom risotto."
US,86,23,Pinot Noir,red,Ghost Pines 2013 Winemaker's Blend Pinot Noir (Sonoma County-Monterey County),"Damp forest and dried cherry with cranberry combine on the nose and palate in this wine, sourced predominantly from Monterey County. Soft and silky it risks veering off balance once the oak begins to unwrap, becoming quite burly on the finish."
US,92,115,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Etude 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Black pepper and juicy blueberry expand on the palate in this juicy, plush and likable 100% varietal wine, accented in full-bodied ripeness and wafts of vanilla smoke."
US,90,48,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,W.H. Smith 2009 Bronze Label Piedra Hill Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"This Cabernet shows the austerity and dry tannins of a Howell Mountain wine, as well as a fine streak of acidity and oak. It has a blunt core of red currants and mocha. Seems to want some time, so give it 4–6 years to settle down."

France,85,25,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Château Grand Bourgeau 2014  Bordeaux Blanc,"This wine offers touches of tropical fruits as well as a crisper edge of citrus and herbal flavors. It is a lightly textured, tangy and very fresh 100% Sauvignon Blanc. Drink now."
US,93,18,Riesling,white,Love & Squalor 2013 Riesling (Willamette Valley),"This packs tremendous flavor into a low-alcohol wine with moderate residual sugar. Peach pit and juice, green apple and citrusy acids start it off. The flavors keep going through a long, complex finish, adding subtle notes of herb and cut grass."
US,86,22,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Holly's Hill 2012 Petit Patriarche Red (El Dorado),"This wine packs a big wallop of superripe flavors, so it doesn't taste as petite as its name. Aromas like raisins and rhubarb lead to deep, overripe fruit flavors recalling prunes and dried cherries. An overall feeling of full body persists, but without much tannin to support it."
US,90,60,Pinot Noir,red,Origin 2014 Johan Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is showing a bit of muscle, and some still-integrating barrel flavors, but it's already a wine that delivers plenty of pleasure. Forgive the flaky faux-wax topping (not thick enough to be called a real capsule) and enjoy the well-ripened blackberry fruit, the nicely-layered creamy chocolate, the touch of underbrush and the appealing length. Drink now through 2022."
Italy,89,16,Red Blend,red,Fattoria San Michele a Torri 2013 Tenuta La Gabbiola  (Chianti Classico),"Enticing scents of blue flower, plum, blackberry and dried herb come together on this. The fresh, chewy palate offers dried black cherry, anise and tobacco set against a backbone of assertive tannins and zesty acidity."
US,85,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Mettler Family Vineyards 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"The cassis, black currant, chocolate and sweet oak flavors star in this soft, easy wine. It could use a firmer structure, but it's very savory and easy to drink."
US,92,25,Chardonnay,white,Ardenvoir 2009 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A new offering from Ardenvoir, this Chardonnay is as Burgundian as any in Washington. Fine, tart and racy fruit is married to top-notch French oak. The meld of vivid apple and citrus flavors to mineral-soaked acidity and a frame of toasted coconut is marvelously seductive. Ageworthy but already delicious."
France,88,23,Chardonnay,white,Verget 2008 Clos Saint-Pierre  (Mâcon-Charnay),"Ripe, full-bodied wine, the fresh white currant and pear fruits layered with wood. The wine is bright with good concentration. Screwcap."
US,91,125,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Revival 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a satisfying, small-production wine from four rows of the family's Kairos Vineyard, a study in sanguine intensity. Currant, cassis and tar integrate with the body of subtle oak and tannin, finishing in a sprinkling of dried herb and graphite."
Italy,90,28,Red Blend,red,Poliziano 2011  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,"Aromas of iris, violet and dark berry slowly take shape in the glass. The firm palate offers fleshy black cherry, plum, espresso, tobacco and a hint of vanilla alongside firm tannins. Drink through 2019."
US,90,35,Chardonnay,white,Efeste 2014 Lola Evergreen Vineyard Chardonnay (Ancient Lakes),"The aromas of mineral, spice, toast, yellow apple and lemon pith are light but enchanting. The palate is medium bodied and refined, demonstrating judicious use of oak and a lengthy finish that shows some warmth."
France,90,19,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château de la Jaubertie 2010 Mirabelle de la Jaubertie White (Bergerac Sec),"This wood-aged wine shows equal notes of toasty spice and ripe fruit. On the palate, it's full and round, with pear and apricot flavors giving it richness. This is concentrated and worth aging for another 2–3 years."
France,93,79,Chardonnay,white,H. Blin NV L'Esprit Nature Extra Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"This 2013-based wine is labeled Extra Brut, and Extra Brut it definitely is. Very crisp and tight with acidity, it hasn't a hint of flesh on its bare bones. The result is a Champagne that will need time to fill out and gain the richness it shows the potential for. Drink from 2019."
US,91,85,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Archimedes 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"One of the producer's top wines, this wine is named both for Francis Ford Coppola's uncle and for the famous mathematician of ancient Greece. It does the men proud in its structured and refined components marked by black pepper, cinnamon and clove, as well as precision of tannin and grip, a powerful wine that's also sleekly smart."
US,95,200,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Ramey 2013 Pedregal Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"This wine was co-fermented with 15% Petit Verdot from the same rocky, hillside site. The two varieties marry seamlessly in the glass, exuding a distinct perfume of forest mushroom and violet. Though pronounced in structure the wine is also soft and round, with a dotting of dried herb and a considerable length of clove and dust. It's rich, intense and memorable."
France,92,75,Chardonnay,white,Louis Jadot 2010 Le Clos Blanc Grèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),"This is a round, rich and soft style of Chardonnay. It feels generous, and its yellow fruit flavor pushes through the acidity. It slowly opens to reveal complex tropical-fruit notes, and it will develop further, so give it another four years."
US,87,20,Chardonnay,white,Charles Krug 2009 Chardonnay (Carneros),"Here's a softly rich Chardonnay that shows lots of appeal at a pretty good price. It's honeyed in pineapple, nectarine, guava and vanilla cream flavors, with a pretty overlay of sweetly smoked oak."
US,85,28,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Icaria 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Icarus, in Greek myth, got too close to the sun. So did this wine from Icaria. It's not bad, but simply overripe. Has a sweet taste of raisins, in addition to the sweet smokiness from oak. Drink now."
US,83,15,Red Blend,red,Tarara 2011 Boneyard Red (Virginia),"Light to medium in body, this wine has a soft, malleable texture that bears just a touch of tannic traction. It tastes of waxy cherries and herbs, with a cinnamon note on the finish that fades in and out."
US,87,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Covington 2010 Klipsun Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"It's quite tannic, as is to be expected from this founding Red Mountain vineyard, and yet the wine seems smoothed over, buffed out. The black cherry and cassis fruit does not penetrate. Drink up."
France,84,17,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Château Gigognan 2012 Vignes du Prieuré Red (Côtes du Rhône),"Hints of vinyl or nail polish, chocolate and raisin distract a bit from the otherwise pleasant cherry-berry fruit. It's round in the mouth, with soft tannins, so drink it over the near term."
US,86,45,Zinfandel,red,St. Francis 2013 Three Valleys Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Sweet, ripe tannins are embraced by a soft texture and touches of black pepper in this multiple appellation wine. Robust, if not bordering on crazy ripe, it needs food to find itself fully."
US,88,38,Pinot Noir,red,Apriori 2014 Sangiacomo Roberts Road Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Rustic on the nose, this is an earthy, herb-filled wine made in a robust style, juicy and exhibiting glassfuls of rhubarb and black tea. Integrated in terms of oak and tannin, it's youthful and may need some time to grow."
France,90,70,Chardonnay,white,Joseph Drouhin 2012  Puligny-Montrachet,"One of the trio of great white wine villages in the Côte de Beaune, Puligny-Montrachet makes the most classical wines. This village wine has the best of all worlds with its generous fruit and beautifully taut texture. It's ready to drink but will also age well. Drink now and until 2022."
US,81,14,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Clayhouse 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),"Sweet and acidic, with strong gooseberry flavors that veer into ammonia."
Italy,84,20,White Blend,white,Adalia 2015 Singan  (Soave),"Here's a light-bodied casual wine that has subdued aromas suggesting white flower, orchard fruit and a hint of almond. You can find traces of the nose on the extremely simple diluted palate."
France,87,34,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Clos Puy Arnaud 2012  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"Very fruity, very juicy, this wine is all about crisp, fresh fruitiness, starting with hand-picked biodynamic vineyard plots and gravity-flow into the winery. Red currants dominate, with considerable acidity right at the fore. At the back, the tannins are developing, but fruit will be the hallmark for the long future. Owner Thierry Valette's family also owns Château Troplong-Mondot in Saint-Émilion."
US,89,38,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,La Chanterelle 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Young, tight and sharp-toned upon first sniff, this broadens out and opens up with an hour or two of airing. The pinpoint focus brings black raspberry, black cherry and light hints of tobacco into play. The 30% new oak seems just right, although there is some burn in the finish from the high alcohol."
US,92,35,Chardonnay,white,Thomas Fogarty 2012 Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Asian pear, crisp lime juice and crushed chalk show on the nose of this very restrained wine from one of the region's top-tier producers. The palate is framed in lively acidity and strong minerality, presenting flavors of white rocks, lemon peel and brie rind. A nice amount of grip will ensure some aging potential too."
US,90,15,Riesling,white,Keuka Spring 2013 Semi Sweet Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Rich, ripe yellow cherries and honeysuckle waft from this luxuriously honeyed off-dry Riesling. A sweet tangerine flavor is densely concentrated on the palate, yet the wine is sprightly and zesty in mouthfeel. An elegant floral spray extends the long, lingering finish."
US,92,33,Chardonnay,white,Rex Hill 2015 Seven Soils Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Lush aromatics push a bouquet of toasted hazelnuts, citrus peel, apples and white peaches up from the glass. Flavors follow in a clean, spicy wine with a fresh and lively mouthfeel. One-third of the fruit was sourced from the estate's premier Jacob-Hart vineyard, and the wine spent 11 months in 20% new French oak."
France,88,38,Chardonnay,white,Baron-Fuenté NV Esprit Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"This ripe Chardonnay has a soft texture and only the lightest minerality. It is fresh, tangy with lemon-zest flavors and refreshing acidity. The aftertaste with a burst of crispness is particularly attractive."
Italy,87,16,White Blend,white,Barberani 2012 Castagnolo  (Orvieto Classico Superiore),"Made from a blend of Grechetto, Procanico and other varieties, this charming wine from central Italy opens with aromas of tropical fruit, ripe yellow peach and a whiff of smoke. The palate offers flavors of pineapple, golden apple, and citrus, with a bitter almond note that unfolds on the finish."
Italy,89,20,Chardonnay,white,Ruffino 2006 La Solatia Chardonnay (Toscana),This charming Chardonnay-based white (with 10% Viognier) from Tuscany offers both strength and elegance. It sees three months of oak for softness and smoothness but also has pretty floral aromas that fill in the edges. Drink it with pasta or risotto.
US,91,19,Chardonnay,white,Kopriva 2015 Unoaked Chardonnay (Carneros),"Spicy acidity and a refreshing lift of lemon verbena highlight this unoaked wine, framing its medium body and lemon verbena, mandarin orange and grapefruit peel flavors."
France,90,13,Red Blend,red,Château d'Antugnac 2005 Aux Bons Hommes Red (Limoux),"A big, smooth, ripe wine, with rich raspberry-jam flavors and just gently dry tannins. This blend of Merlot with some Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon comes from vineyards 1,500 feet in the Limoux hills, yet it has the richness of a wine from warmer climate. Wood and spices add interest and richness."
US,85,25,Chardonnay,white,Hendry 2005 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Here's an oaky, ripe Chardonnay. It has pleasant pineapple, peach and lemon flavors and crisp acidity, and while it's not especially complex, it's a nice Chard for drinking now."
US,95,62,Pinot Noir,red,Mount Eden Vineyards 2013 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This wine is wound extremely tight, but opens like a lotus with decanting or overnight patience. Aromas of rose buds, black-raspberry extract, wet clay and dried purple flowers show on the nose, bolstered by the slightest smoky kiss of oak. Savory flavors of roasted black-plum skins and elderberry meet with soy, graphite and loam on the palate, which will gain amazing tertiary flavors with time. Drink 2018–2028."
US,85,35,Red Blend,red,DanCin 2013 Tribute Red (Southern Oregon),"Tribute is a blend of 43% Barbera, 43% Sangiovese and 14% Nebbiolo—a difficult enterprise at best, particularly with fruit from young vines. It's thin and generic, showing no distinct varietal character."
France,85,13,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Exem 2014  Bordeaux,"The wine is soft with a toasty spicy character. That balances with the ripe berry fruits that are just on the stalky side of smooth. Drink this wine, with its fruity 70% Merlot, now."
US,88,28,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Geyser Peak 1998 Kuimelis Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"It's shy in the nose, with suggestions of cassis and smoky oak, while the flavors veer toward berries and spices, swimming in firm tannins and sharp acidity. It's a delicate wine, one of finesse rather than power, but it is very good. A long, sweetly ripe finish suggests ageability, but it's probably at its youthful, fleshy best now."
US,91,85,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Highlands 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Smoky oak enwraps fully developed layers of cherry and blackberry fruit in this thick wine packed with generous tannins. A hearty backbone of oak accents additional leather and dark chocolate flavors.
US,93,19,Zinfandel,red,Boeger 2013 Walker Vineyard Zinfandel (El Dorado),"Purely delicious, this has stunning and distinctive aromas and flavors that recall pomegranate juice and blueberries, plus a velvety-smooth texture. While very full bodied, this wine does not win with power but with grace. It has excellent balance and harmony, and stands above the crowd."
US,87,25,Merlot,red,Claar 2011 Estate Grown and Bottled Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine opens with aromas of vanilla and baking spices that are followed by broad, silky-feeling fruit and barrel flavors, finishing on a somewhat bitter note. The oak holds a prominent role but still plays its part well."
US,91,65,Pinot Noir,red,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2014 Bernau Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Planted in 1983, this is the original Willamette Valley Vineyards estate vineyard. The wine remains stiff and wrapped up tight, with a mix of wild strawberry, raspberry and cherry fruit. There's a light dusting of baking spices, the result of aging 14 months in one-quarter new French oak."
US,91,60,Chardonnay,white,Mount Eden Vineyards 2011 Estate Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Movie theater aromas of caramel candy, buttered popcorn and burned popcorn kernels converge on the nose of this classic Chardonnay from one of California's most historic vineyards. Despite the prominent nose, the flavors are elegantly restrained, with a brisk acidity surrounding warmer notes of caramelized pineapple."
US,94,35,Merlot,red,Sineann 2009 Champoux Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"If any wine can blow away the thought that Merlot is a thin, wimpy, nondescript red, this is the wine. From the iconic Champoux Vineyard, it has magic and muscle, a broad and deep display of black fruits, coffee, licorice, dark chocolate, baking spices and beautifully built tannins. Explore and enjoy."
France,92,30,Riesling,white,Domaine Rieflé-Landmann 2015 Seppi Landmann Zinnkoepfle Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"A rich, mellow whiff of vanilla and burnt sugar sweeps across the nose at first before appetizing tart notes of Granny Smith apple kick in. The palate is superfresh with these same green apple notes but also has a toasty mellowness adding and earthy charm and a richer, pithy texture. The finish is rounded but dry and lasting."
US,94,60,Chardonnay,white,Roco 2014 Knudsen Vineyards Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Smooth and full bodied, this is packed with robust peach, pear, apple, lime and candied pineapple. There's a streak of vanilla custard from time in new oak, and length-extending minerality. This just keeps on going in the most delightful fashion."
US,91,85,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Davis Estates 2012 Zephyr Private Reserve Red (Napa Valley),"A proprietary blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc, 3% Merlot and 2% Petit Verdot, Zephyr is thick and rich. It offers a ripe, juicy and soft expression of mocha, coconut and blackberry jam that's generous on the palate."
France,88,25,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Romain Reverdy 2015 Florilège  (Sancerre),The wine goes for the herbal side of Sauvignon Blanc with its green-fruit and gooseberry flavors. There is a grassy character that gives the wine its intensely crisp acidity. Drink this wine from 2018 so it can calm down.
US,88,25,Pinot Noir,red,Borrellie 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Bright and supple, this wine is vibrantly awash in red cherry, raspberry and whisps of vanilla, finishing lean and with plenty of versatility."
US,93,35,Chardonnay,white,De Loach 2010 Estate Collection Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Tastes of perfectly ripened pineapple, pear, lime and peach flavors. On the structural side is fine acidity and a tangy minerality, like a lick of cold steel. Oak is here, notable but perfectly integrated. Give this Chard a little time in the glass to breathe."
US,82,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Madrigal 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),"Way too ripe, with raisiny, porty aromas and flavors that turn bitter on the finish."
US,89,40,Red Blend,red,Sinclair Estate Vineyards 2009 Pentatonic Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The blend is 51% Merlot, the rest divided among five other grapes, including Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. Consequently, it's a bit of a mish-mash, fruity to the point of grapy, medium long, with the barrel flavors unresolved. Give this one another year or two of aging to allow all the components to come together."
Italy,90,29,Sangiovese,red,Jacopo Biondi-Santi 2008 Castello di Montepò  (Morellino di Scansano),"Jacopo Biondi Santi hits a home run with this beautiful Morellino. The wine is smooth and dense, with lively cherry notes, soft spice and tobacco. It's straightforward and plush, but elegant at the same time."
US,89,24,Pinot Noir,red,Oak Knoll 2006 Red Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Oregon),"From a vineyard in southern Oregon that is actually its own, self-contained AVA (Red Hill Douglas County), this is a well-structured Pinot Noir with grip and authority. There is a noticeable smokiness to both nose and palate, not unpleasant, and the fruit is tight and supple. Black cherry and blackberry flavors are set in charred wood tannins, but everything is in proportion and nicely developed."
France,87,12,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Domaine Sainte-Eugénie 2009 Red (Corbières),"This wine needs some time to open up after pouring to fully express itself. With time, rich notes of black currant, brambly berry and black cherry grace the nose and mouth, with a touch of licorice root and espesso unfolding after swallow."
Italy,88,18,Sangiovese,red,Lohsa 2000  Morellino di Scansano,"Fresh and full, with a deep berry nose, drying tannins and ample but not overdone oak. In the mouth, it's pretty solid, and the cherry and black-plum fruit is clean and tasty. It's on the stout side, with youthful acidity and a good deal of warmth to the smoky finish. From Poliziano."
France,91,27,Riesling,white,Frédéric Mallo 2010 Rosacker Grand Cru Vieilles Vignes Riesling (Alsace),"Subdued but promising apple-ripeness on the nose leads to a rounded, fully mature palate that rings with fresh and dried apple. There are hints of hay and and a wonderfully, clean core of lemon freshness that is supremely well cushioned on these rich, intense flavors. Drink 2016–2019."
US,88,28,Chardonnay,white,Cathedral Ridge 2014 McDuffee Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (OR)),"Smooth and lightly toasty, this offers plump, palate-pleasing tree fruits and a touch of vanilla custard. Just a tad lighter than the reserve from the same vintage and vineyard."
US,88,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Mayacamas 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"Lots of dry elegance in this wine. It's also more acidic than your typical Napa Cabernet, with a tart bite. The tannins are young and forceful, and the finish is totally dry. As presently constituted, it's somewhat tough and lean. But the core of cherries and blackberries suggests some degree of ageabilty. Hold until 2015."
US,85,25,Red Blend,red,Hudson-Chatham 2014 River's Edge Casscles Vineyards Red (New York),"A highly unusual blend of Burdin, a rare French hybrid, and Chambourcin grapes, this red wine offers delicate maraschino-cherry and berry flavors. It's a slightly fragile wine but whiffs of tobacco and garden soil lend complexity. The finish lingers on tart red fruit flavors and a hint of tannin."
US,85,38,Pinot Noir,red,LaVelle 2011 Four Brothers Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is the first release for the Four Brothers designation. Tastes of brown sugar flavors filling in around a thin core of barely ripe fruit. The sweet impression returns in the finish, this time with a lick of maple syrup."
US,85,27,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Stacked Stone 2005 The Quarry Red (Paso Robles),"Made from the two Cabernets, Merlot and a drop of Petit Verdot, this is a gentle wine with some true complexity. It has interesting cherry flavor with a deeper stream of cassis liqueur."
US,85,12,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Ironstone 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"A powerful, almost overbearing oak influence makes this wine bombastic. Toasty, maple sugar and smoked bacon flavors come from heavily charred new oak barrels or oak add-ins. It has a very dark color, full body, plenty of tannins and a smoky, oaky finish."
US,88,20,Pinot Noir,red,Henry Estate 2015 Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"This is an elegant edition of the Henry Estate Pinot Noir. It has shed its rusticity in favor of a delicate expression of varietal character. Crushed rose petals, wild raspberries and a dash of pepper are backed with stiff tannins. Give it another year to fully come together."
US,93,90,Pinot Noir,red,Notre Vin 2006 Clos Madeleine Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a unique Pinot Noir, different from almost everything else out there. Sourced from a vineyard in the Petaluma Gap region (perhaps a future AVA), it's bone dry, moderate in alcohol, and tannic. It has lighter, leaner flavors than most Pinots, with the fruit accompanied by herbs, minerals, flowers and mushrooms. Fans of super-fruity Pinots will find it unrich, but Burgundy lovers may think of Pommard. It will be fascinating to track this wine's progress."
US,86,23,Pinot Noir,red,Pali 2012 Huntington Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Intensely ripe raspberry and cherry pie flavors mark this wine. Oak brings even greater richness, in the form of buttered cinnamon toast. The finish is dry, and there's a good burst of acidity. The alcohol is a little hot, but still, it's a nice, silky wine for drinking now."
France,91,39,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château la Garde 2014  Pessac-Léognan,"This is a fine wood-aged blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot and Petit Verdot. It is darkly colored, dense and with great ripe tannins. One of several Bordeaux properties owned by the Thiénot family, this estate occupies a fine, gravel outcrop in the Pessac-Léognan region, just south of Bordeaux. Drink from 2024."
US,87,25,Syrah,red,Pianetta 2007 Estate Bottled Syrah (Monterey),"Lots of acidity and black pepper in this bone-dry wine, giving it a scoury mouthfeel. But you'll find very rich, elaborate blackberry and cherry jam, chocolate and bacon flavors. Drink now."
US,90,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Brander 2015 Bouchet Red,"Black cherry pie, milk chocolate and lilacs combine for a very accessible and rather lavish nose on this blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot. It's easy to like on the sip, with candied purple fruit and licorice spice flavors, proving very fruity, lush and quaffable."
US,89,30,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Babcock 1998 Fathom Red (Santa Barbara County),"Made largely of Cabernet Franc, this wine has all the elements of first-rate Meritage: ripe blackberry and blueberry fruit, accompanied by a blast of smoky oak. It tastes good, too, with pure, sweet, supple berry flavors; yet, it's very dry, with ample acidity. It lacks the focus of North Coast claret-style wines, but is certainly among the best of the genre from the South Coast."
Italy,93,112,Syrah,red,Duemani 2004 Suisassi Syrah (Toscana),"Luca D'Attoma and Elena Celli's new biodynamic Syrah exhibits opulent layers of soft chocolate, spice, red berry, leather and lingering tones of vanilla bean. In the mouth, the wine is chewy, tart and bursting with plump fruit flavors."
France,86,20,Pinot Gris,white,Cave de Ribeauvillé 2016 Collection Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Fresh easy notes of pear drop rise from the glass. The very slender palate has lemony freshness but also residual sweetness and a pithy phenolic edge. This is fresh, off dry and just balanced. Drink soon."
US,91,40,Syrah,red,Ardor 2013 Art Den Hoed Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"This captures attention with piercing cherry and cranberry aromas and with herb and orange-peel grace notes. The palate is soft, polished and layered, with a mouthfeel that dazzles and the flavors to back it up. The finish lingers."
Italy,90,38,Sangiovese,red,Castello di Gabbiano 2010 Bellezza Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),"Made with 100% Sangiovese, this conveys aromas of violet, vanilla, pressed powder and perfumed berry. The vibrant, structured palate delivers juicy wild cherry, licorice, black pepper and toast alongside firm tannins and fresh acidity. It finishes on a mocha note. Drink 2015–2022."
US,88,41,Syrah,red,Kontos 2014 Les Collines Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The aromas are fresh, with notes of cranberry, red currant, baking spice and Red Vines. The palate is on the lighter side of medium bodied, trailing a bit on the finish. The vineyard, one of the state's top Syrah sites, doesn't seem to stand out as much as it typically does."
US,91,55,Pinot Noir,red,Fog Crest 2012 Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Warren Dutton planted the first vineyard block of this Russian River Valley producer, the Pinot a combination of Dijon and Pommard clones. In the hands of new winemaker Jerome Chéry, the wine is exotic in spicy cinnamon and cardamom, earthy and herbal with layers of dark cherry."
Italy,90,28,Red Blend,red,Fattorie Parri 2009 Tenuta Corfecciano Urbana Riserva  (Chianti Montespertoli),"Menthol, savory herb and dark-skinned berry aromas lead the nose along with a balsamic note. The full-bodied but accessible palate doles out black cherry, crushed plum, sage and soothing licorice alongside velvety tannins. Enjoy through 2016."
US,93,24,Red Blend,red,Sean Thackrey NV Pleiades XIX Old Vines Red (California),"With a translucent ruby color and silky texture, this could be a Pinot Noir. But it's a blend of Sangiovese, Voignier, Mourvèdre and several other varieties, and shows its own unique profile. Dry and crisp, the flavors are fruity, floral, herbal and spicy. Raspberries, cherries, thyme, white pepper, bacon, oregano and smoky sandalwood only begin to describe the complexities. They change by the second in the glass, but always finish dry."
US,90,36,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Marshall Davis 2014 Seven Hills Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"Blackberry, anise and spice aromas are followed by rich full-fruit flavors. It's made in a hedonistic style that doesn't hold back."
France,88,25,Pinot Gris,white,Emile Beyer 2014 Tradition Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Only very subdued notes of citrus emerge and add a little polish to a rounded, balanced and dry palate. However, a lovely, bundled ray of tangerine zestiness at the core brightens the wine immensely."
US,84,10,Merlot,red,McManis 2011 Merlot (California),"Ripe and very dry, this has flavors of raisins, blackberries and dark chocolate, with a hint of smoky oak that adds richness."
Italy,93,18,Red Blend,red,Selvapiana 2013  Chianti Rufina,"Elegant and fragrant, this opens with aromas of pressed rose, crushed violet, wild berry and a whiff of baking spice. The vibrant, focused palate delivers juicy red cherry, raspberry, white pepper, cinnamon and dried herb. It's well balanced, with supple tannins and bright acidity. Drink through 2018."
US,92,48,Pinot Noir,red,Quintet 2014 Lichtenwalter Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"Textural and spicy, this has a subtle mix of herb, salts, stem, leaf and wild berry flavors. It's fascinating and complex, with the sort of mystifying sex appeal that only Pinot Noir seems to be capable of. It spent 18 months in 30% new French oak to good effect."
US,91,28,Syrah,red,DaMa 2010 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This spicy, elegant take on Syrah will reward your attention. Boysenberry and other purple/black fruits are expressed both aromatically and on the palate, with light touches of vanilla. The overall impression is of a pretty, structured, textural wine, with excellent length and balance."
France,90,42,Riesling,white,Domaine François Schmitt 2014 Pfingstberg Grand Cru Paradis Riesling (Alsace),"Lemon notes are subdued by earth on the nose but they shine on a rather textured, palate that needs some air to open up. There is concentration at the core and generous freshness that lights up everything. Subtle but totally worthwhile with a clean lemon finish."
US,93,36,Syrah,red,Rusack 2008 Ballard Canyon Estate Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"From Rusack's estate vineyard, this is a very fine, young Syrah. It shows rich blackberry, red currant, licorice, cocoa, smoked meat and sandalwood flavors, but is also quite tannic, and some of those tannins come from new oak. If you drink it now, give it a good decant. Should hold in the bottle for at least six years."
US,86,26,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Ledson 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Made in the slightly sweet, crisp popular style, this Sauvignon Blanc offers easy flavors of pineapple, pear and apple juice, with the sweet vanilla of oak."
US,90,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Sebastiani 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Soft and luscious, this has just enough tannin and acidity to give structure to the delicious black-cherry, cocoa and bacon flavors. Drink now."
France,86,18,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Landat 2011  Haut-Médoc,"This is dark and firm, with sufficient fruit to promise a rich future. The wine has ample weight, a solid, dense core and a juicy outer layer. Good for 3–5 years."
US,92,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Charles Krug 2010 Family Reserve Generations Estate Red (Napa Valley),"A lovely wine, soft and supple, with a superb tannin structure framing the most interesting and delicious flavors. Blackberries, blueberries, red and black currants, anise and cedar notes all come together in balanced harmony, leading to a long, dry finish. Not an ager, but an elegant Napa Valley wine to drink now and over the next few years."
US,95,50,Chardonnay,white,Gary Farrell 2014 Bacigalupi Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Made from one of the vineyard's historic blocks, this is a lush, inviting and complex wine, defined by golden honey apple and nutmeg. The texture is contoured and structured, with the richness of lemon meringue, but the balance is what stands out most. A tang of white pepper flirts on the finish."
France,93,22,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Lilian Ladouys 2011  Saint-Estèphe,"While the wood is still very apparent in this wine, it does also have the rich fruit as a balance. The acidity, dark berry fruits and a fine juicy character go with the firm tannins and spicy wood character. Drink from 2017."
US,82,16,Pinot Grigio,white,Francis Coppola 2009 Diamond Collection Emerald Label Pinot Grigio (California),"A semisweet wine, with apricot jam and citrus flavors, offset by crisp acidity. Turns cloying after a few sips."
France,86,26,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Haut Barrail 2013  Médoc,"Almost ready to drink now, this is a rounded, smooth wine with only light tannins but plenty of fruitiness. It's not a big wine, balanced and juicy with attractive fruits. Drink from 2017."
US,84,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Three Saints 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"Dry and firmly tannic, this Cab has upfront flavors of black currants, plums, mocha and cedary oak. There's some sharpness in the texture that limits ageability, but it's a pretty wine for now."
US,91,75,Merlot,red,Hourglass 2006 Blueline Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"Very big and smoky, an impressive young Merlot that grabs you by the collar and shakes you. Made by the veteran Robert Foley, it's in his style, a ripe, powerful wine exuding massive flavors of black cherries, cassis and chocolate."
US,86,25,Pinot Noir,red,Robert James Wines 2015 Little Fox Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"There's a diluted nature to this wine, from a selection of varietal clones. Dry, it holds back on flavor, delivering a light texture and soft red-fruit flavors."
US,89,45,Zinfandel,red,Lone Madrone 2014 Sheep Camp Zinfandel (Paso Robles Willow Creek District),"Winemaker Neil Collins spends his time diving into the region's little known, dry-farmed old vines to deliver distinctive and delicate Zinfandels. This one shows wet riverstone scents, with smashed blackberry and lavender. The palate offers tart black plum, peppercorn and tar touches."
France,86,70,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Franc le Maine 2008  Saint-Émilion,"Tannic and dry, this wine is beginning to show its age. It still has some juicy red fruits but they are covered by the firm structure and dusty character of the wine. It needs to be drunk now."
US,88,17,Riesling,white,Red Newt Cellars 2014 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Hints of smoke and bramble linger from nose to finish, lending a savory complexity to this dry-style Riesling. It's spry and invigorating, juxtaposing tart pineapple and lemon flavors against a backdrop of pressed apple and pear. The finish extends long with an elegant mineral tinge."
US,86,18,White Blend,white,Glenora 2013 Signature White (Finger Lakes),"Juicy, ripe peach and blossom notes perfume this full bodied blend of Chardonnay, Riesling and Pinot Blanc. It's moderately concentrated, with delicate flavors of fresh stone fruit, pear and toast, but enlivened by a streak of sunny lemon acidity. Finishes briskly."
France,84,15,Riesling,white,Klipfel 2011 Cuvée Particulière Riesling (Alsace),"This is a soft, rather unfocused wine that is pleasantly fruity with flavors of apples and currants. It's lightly perfumed and ready to drink now."
US,92,48,Pinot Noir,red,Dehlinger 2013 Goldridge Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Goldridge honors the soil series so important in the appellation, offering floral aromas that lead into silky-smooth texture with tension. Earthy, it conjures notions of fresh-picked strawberry, black tea and kirsch, with an approachability that doesn't distract from its complexity."
Italy,90,130,Sangiovese,red,Banfi 2009 Poggio alle Mura Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"This firmly structured wine opens with toasted aromas, baked plum, fennel and a licorice note. The palate offers dried cherry, fig, roasted coffee bean and anisette alongside bracing tannins. Drink through 2020."
US,91,35,Syrah,red,Red Car 2010 Syrah (Sonoma Coast),"The winery's larger-scale Syrah (and that's still under 2,000 cases), this is a friendly, sophisticated Rhône-inspired wine grown on the cooler Sonoma Coast. Red and blue fruits are expertly ripe and high-toned, accented by layers of classic cool-climate spice."
Italy,93,65,Red Blend,red,Montemercurio 2007 Damo  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"Damo has earthy fragrances of tobacco leaf, underbrush and truffle, along with notes of raspberry and spice. The palate shows ripe black cherry, vanilla and sweet spice flavors, as well as a hint of licorice. This has nice depth and balance, but will be more complex after 2017."
Italy,87,40,Sangiovese,red,Le Bèrne 2011  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,"Blue flower, ripe plum and baking spice aromas lead the nose on this robust wine. The palate lacks fruit richness, offering dried black cherry, licorice, dark spice and searing alcohol alongside assertive, drying tannins."
US,90,23,Merlot,red,Novelty Hill 2010 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The vineyard-designated wines from Novelty Hill consistently reflect the site in terms of a deep-seated earthy, herbal character. It's quite like a modern Bordeaux, taking the cassis fruit as a base and cloaking it with toasted flavors from earth and barrel."
US,90,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2013 Horse Heaven Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Horse Heaven Hills),"Coming from the warm 2013 vintage, this is an aromatic offering, with notes of pineapple, kiwi, herbs and oak spices (40% barrel fermented). It's creamy in feel, but with tart, vibrant acidity that keeps the palate fresh and lively."
US,89,75,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Chateau St. Jean 2010 Cinq Cepages Red (Sonoma County),"Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this blend has rich, pleasant cherry, currant and mocha flavors, enhanced with sweet toasty oak. A soft, luscious wine with a lot of popular appeal, it's drinking beautifully now."
US,92,24,Riesling,white,Pey-Marin 2007 The Shell Mound Riesling (Marin County),"This was one of the best Rieslings of the year last vintage, and the '07 is even better. It's absolutely dry and superbly racy. Acidity, at .82, is one of the highest I've seen in years. Balancing that is a broad, complex array of citrus, peach, apple, flower, petrol, mineral and spice flavors. If California Riesling is making a comeback, it's because of wines like this."
US,86,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Wofford Acres 2007 Estate Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (El Dorado),"Good flavors of blackberries, currants and cedar in this wine, with a rich, chocolately edge. There are problems with the structure, though, that lead to a sharp, prickly mouthfeel. Drink now."
Italy,84,16,Chardonnay,white,Valle dell'Asso 2007 Galatina Chardonnay (Galatina),"This is a Chardonnay-based wine with aromas of white mineral, stone fruit and passion fruit. It is an easy, no-fuss wine that would pair well with light salad lunches or sandwich snacks."
US,87,12,Pinot Grigio,white,Vino 2013 Pinot Grigio (Ancient Lakes),"Light mineral and lemon-rind aromas are followed by dry, tart flavors. It should shine on the dinner table."
US,88,10,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Castle Rock 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino County),"An attractive floral, appley aroma and generous, ripe apple and herb flavors give this medium-bodied wine plenty of personality."
Italy,87,18,Red Blend,red,Terre del Marchesato 2013 Inedito Red (Toscana),"A 50-50 blend of Merlot and Syrah, this easygoing wine opens with aromas of red currant, graphite and cracked peppercorn. The lively palate offers blackberries, blueberries and clove alongside tangy acidity and dusty tannins."
US,91,45,Pinot Noir,red,Riverbench 2012 Cork Jumper Rosé Blanc de Noirs Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Red apples, sourdough bread, cherry blossoms and strawberry zest show on the nose of this ever-so-slightly pink wine. The sipping experience is reminiscent of a fizzy, foamy mouthful of Pop Rocks flavored by sour cherries, altogether fun, tart and delicious."
US,88,50,Syrah,red,Graveyard 2014 Graveyard Vineyard Reserve Syrah (Paso Robles),"The nose on this bottling shows fresh boysenberry and primary grape scents, with lots of sweet rosemary and purple flower nuance. The sip is not overly complicated, with tar at first and then waves of blackberry and boysenberry fruit, lifted by thyme and peppercorns."
Italy,90,75,Red Blend,red,Giuseppe Campagnola 2009 Vigneti Vallata di Marano  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"Here's a straightforward Amarone, with dense black fruit and spice aromas. The palate delivers blackberry, plum and raisin flavors, with white pepper and chocolate accents. It doesn't have a lot of complexity, but is delicious and ready to drink."
US,88,55,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Clos Pegase 2013 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This wine consists of all five red Bordeaux varieties plus 5% Syrah. Tart, soft and juicy with black and red cherry fruit, it's direct in its delivery of dried herb and licorice—flavors that complement the robust ripeness and density."
US,88,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Sutcliffe 2009 Canyon of the Ancients Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Colorado),"Although the aromas of cassis, spiced blackberry, maduro and dried herb are restrained on first sniff, with some air and coaxing they become more assertive. The medium-bodied palate has a pliant core, and the tightly coiled tannins come alive on the finish."
US,89,55,Syrah,red,Cowhorn 2011 Sentience Syrah (Applegate Valley),"Tart and tannic, this has a sleek, almost steely character, with cranberry and black cherry fruit, razor's edge tannins, and supporting acidity."
US,93,60,Pinot Noir,red,Elk Cove 2014 Clay Court Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"A standout among the winery's single-vineyard selections, this big-boned effort brings flavors of chewy cherry alongside a citrus highlight and a definite underpinning of wet stone and clay. Texturally compelling, it should age gracefully through 2024."
US,96,62,Pinot Noir,red,Foxen 2015 Solomon Hills Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"The impressively plump and prominent strawberry and red-currant aromas are alluring on the nose, enhanced by touches of cinnamon and pepper dust. The palate combines savory pepper spice, red plums and berries, with a solidly simmering acidity shimmering through the entire sip."
US,86,19,Pinot Noir,red,RouteStock 2011 99W Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is a light and fruity wine that's forward on the palate, with red berries and hints of orange peel. It leaves a tart, citrusy aftertaste."
US,82,24,Pinot Grigio,white,Doukénie 2011 Pinot Grigio (Virginia),"Aromas of bees wax and clover honey come with some volatility. The palate tastes a touch bitter and high pitched, and the acidity feels flat. A note of honey-infused breakfast tea surfaces on the palate."
Italy,86,60,Sangiovese,red,Il Paradiso di Frassina 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,"Leafy aromas suggest forest underbrush, dried tobacco leaf and dried rose petals. The palate offers fading wild cherry, hints of cinnamon-spice and astringent, fleeting tannins. It seems fast forwarded by a decade, a trait of this vintage. Superior Wines, V I Wines Distributing."
US,92,60,Syrah,red,Va Piano 2011 Estate Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Rich and aromatic, this black label reserve displays excellent power and concentration. A dense core of cassis, licorice and espresso is brightened with vivid acidity, slowing fading through a long, smoky finish. Wait until 2016 for optimum enjoyment."
US,87,35,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Lail 2010 Blueprint Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This 100% Sauvignon Blanc is forward in citrus, floral, spice and honey flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. A little heavy and full bodied, this has a touch of green gooseberry that makes it exotic and New Zealand style."
US,92,30,Pinot Noir,red,Bravium 2015 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This is an engaging, nervy wine, with a light, savory aroma and tangy red-cherry flavors riding on a firm frame of fine-grained tannins and good acidity. It does not try to overwhelm with superripe fruit or oak, but just lets the purity of the grapes shine through."
US,90,48,Pinot Noir,red,Quintet 2013 Ribbon Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"This wine brings spicy cranberry and strawberry, underscored with a whiff of leather. Flavors punch down and finish strong, with a leathery note that does not preclude the solid fruit."
US,87,45,Pinot Noir,red,Left Coast Cellars 2010 Suzanne's Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The winery's top cuvée, this offers barely ripe rhubarb and cranberry fruit flavors, with heavy tannins tasting of green coffee. The finish has a slight bitterness, but the wine overall shows medium concentration and depth, and could be cellared for a few more years to smooth it out."
France,92,34,Riesling,white,Gustave Lorentz 2013 Burg Riesling (Alsace),"Fresh notes of ripe lemon zest are suffused with hay flower and earth notes. The palate majors on zesty, lively and aromatic citrus: tangerine and Amalfi lemon above all. This is dry and bright, slender and precise, yet never lets go of its earthy touch. The finish is expansive and clean."
US,82,19,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Bianchi 2009 Signature Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),Twin unbalanced notes of vegetables and raisins mar this Cabernet. It's very soft and finishes with notes of prunes and milk chocolate.
US,84,25,Red Blend,red,Minassian-Young 2010 Field Blend Red (Paso Robles),"This blend of Mourvèdre and Counoise is soft and sweet. It tastes like the wine version of a milk-chocolate candy bar, infused with blackberry essence and alcohol."
US,86,20,Red Blend,red,Ben Ish NV Ben's Select Red (California),"Richly fruity, this wine has a smooth texture and well-concentrated black-plum flavors along with a lightly spicy, bread dough accent that adds interest. It's a touch sweet and supported by light tannins."
US,88,17,Riesling,white,Evergreen 2006 Spruce Goose Riesling (Willamette Valley),"This estate-grown Riesling brings fresh apples and white peaches to the table. Fresh and concentrated, it hits a generous 13.6% alcohol, with suggestions of sweetness from the quite ripe fruit, although it is technically dry. It seems to have real potential for aging and developing over a decade or more."
US,93,24,Chardonnay,white,Sinor-LaVallee 2013 Chardonnay (San Luis Obispo County),"Using fruit mostly from the Bassi Ranch property he recently acquired, Mike Sinor delivers a bright, minerally wine, with aromas of scratched grapefruit skin, orange and peach juice, burned lemons, sea salt, ripe apples and nectarines and fresh-cut herbs. Flavors of salty, lime-juice nectarines emerge once sipped, with hints of butter and white flowers."
France,87,30,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Maison Bouey 2013 Château Lestruelle  (Médoc),"Consultant Stéphane Derenoncourt has helped this light wine to have a good balance and soft, generous fruitiness. The tannins are kind, rounded and already well integrated with the fruit. Drink from 2017."
Italy,85,10,Sangiovese,red,Straccali 2010  Chianti,This blend of Sangiovese and Canaiolo is enhanced with a small percentage of Merlot. That addition heightens the wine's softness and renders a richer mouthfeel.
US,92,70,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Trinchero 2009 Mario's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"Made in a ripe, oaky style, this 100% Cabernet has powerful blackberry and cassis flavors that are a little warm. Its 95% new French oak is evident in the smoke, vanilla, toast and caramel notes. It's a very tannic wine that locks down the palate with dry astringency. All indications suggest the cellar. Give it at least eight years."
US,88,17,Red Blend,red,Matchbook 2013 Tinto Rey Red (Dunnigan Hills),"This is a mouthfilling wine that doesn't go over the top in terms of ripeness or tannins, so it's smooth to drink and offers mild plum and cherry flavors."
US,86,29,Syrah,red,Jax 2005 Y3 Syrah (Napa Valley),"Marked by jammy fruit and high acidity, this Syrah is strong in cherries, raspberries and oak. It's not especially subtle, but it is pretty and polished, and could even acquire bottle complexity over the next 3–4 years."
France,88,36,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château le Sartre 2012  Pessac-Léognan,"While the tannins are very present in this wine, it also has good acidity and blackberry fruits. It's firm and structured in the front, still young, although allowing plenty of room for the fruit to show strongly over the next few years. Drink from 2019."
US,93,40,Syrah,red,Bonaccorsi 2008 Larner Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"A pretty wine, with a touch of wintergreen mint and bacon fat adding complexity to the blackberries, cherries and cassis. Co-fermented with some Viognier, it's vibrant in the mouth, with a welcome cut of acidity to brighten and uplift the fruit. A flashy, elegant, opulent Syrah to drink over the next several years."
US,90,45,Chardonnay,white,Testarossa 2012 Sierra Madre Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Vanilla-soaked French toast and caramelized apples promise a butter bomb in this Testarossa take on the historic Sierra Madre Vineyard in the Santa Maria Valley. Once sipped, there is a surprising level of soda-like acidity, and a steadily emerging flavor profile that ranges from cream soda to squeezed lime."
US,93,75,Syrah,red,No Girls 2012 La Paciencia Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Peat, flower, smoked meat and earthy funk aromas are at the fore. The flavors show a combination of richness and elegance, with smoked meat and olive brine flavors that linger."
Italy,87,15,Red Blend,red,Castello Monaci 2013 Liante Red (Salice Salentino),"A blend of Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera, this opens with aromas of underbrush, violet, clove and spicy plum. The straightforward palate delivers mature blackberry and allspice alongside brawny tannins."
US,88,16,Pinot Noir,red,Corvallis Cellars 2011 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is a solid effort, especially at this price point. The cherry-cola core of flavor grabs your interest quickly, and hangs on with a hint of tobacco in the smooth finish. Some nice acidity adds a touch of minerality."
US,88,33,Merlot,red,Martorana 2006 Merlot (Dry Creek Valley),"Good blackberry, black cherry, cola and spice flavors in this Merlot. It's marked by the jagged, sandpapery tannins that often accompany Dry Creek red wines. You can call it rustic, but it's rustic-chic, an interesting wine with some real complexity."
US,88,33,Syrah,red,Mercer 2008 McKinley Springs Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"Quite oaky, the barrel flavors not yet integrated into the fruit, this starts out rough, then rolls into clean, light, pleasant boysenberry fruit flavors. Should continue to improve with more time in the bottle."
US,87,20,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Loubejac 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"A négociant effort, this was done entirely in stainless steel and neutral oak. Tart and light, it has simple strawberry fruit with a touch of spice. It offers no tricks, just straight-ahead Pinot at a modest price for Oregon."
US,90,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Sparrow Hawk 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Weighty in cinnamon, this wine is soft and entirely spicy throughout, medium in weight and slightly complex. Blackberry and black cherry play off the firm tannins and structured oak, providing girth but not overindulgence."
Italy,87,27,Red Blend,red,Montemercurio 2013 Petaso  (Rosso di Montepulciano),"Chopped herb, underbrush, truffle and balsamic notes lead the nose. The palate is fresh, vibrant and polished, offering sour cherry fruit with a hint of licorice. A sage note closes the finish."
US,84,35,Chardonnay,white,The Full 2012 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Orange, pineapple and mango fruit flavors characterize this simple wine. It's candied on the finish, with plenty of acidity for balance."
US,90,22,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Eberle 2013 Vineyard Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Blackberry jelly meshes with enticing aromas of hot gingerbread on the nose of this bottling by regional pioneer Gary Eberle. Dark chocolate, coffee, black cherry, loam, crushed herbs and graphite all play into the layered palate, held strongly by firm tannins."
Italy,92,80,Red Blend,red,Montevetrano 2010 Montevetrano Red (Colli di Salerno),"This structured yet polished wine, made from a blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Aglianico and 20% Merlot, opens with intense aromas of tilled earth, mature black fruit, leather, graphite and spice. The Juicy palate offers fleshy blackberry, black currant, black pepper and mineral alongside silky smooth tannins. Hold for more complexity. Drink 2015–2025."
US,93,100,Red Blend,red,Turiya 2011 Shapeshifter Red (Central Coast),"There's magic in this 65% Petit Verdot and 35% Sangiovese combination. This shows concentrated cherry and kirsch aromas, touches of shiitake and porcini mushrooms and plenty of turned, wet earth aromas. The palate, framed by chalky tannins, offers more mushrooms and truffles in a black cherry-chocolate gravy, proving quite luxurious and interesting at once."
US,84,25,Chardonnay,white,Pearmund 2013 Old Vine Meriwether Vineyard Chardonnay (Virginia),Muddled citrus and a drizzle of artificial butter initially marks the nose and palate. Additional notes of bitter lemon peel and roasted pear carry the flavors to a slightly astringent finish.
Italy,90,16,Merlot,red,Villa Pillo 2005 Sant'Adele Merlot (Toscana),"Villa Pillo's Sant'Adele is probably Italy's best Merlot at this price point. The wine is soft and smooth with beautiful intensity of aromas that spans from red fruit to sweet spice. It demonstrates clarity and balance with a velvety, opulent style and a crisp close."
US,88,19,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Tower 15 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),"What a nice Sauvignon Blanc this is. It's crisp and delicately structured, with light, airy flavors of limes, dried hay, pineapple zest and white pepper."
US,84,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Clautiere 2005 BDX Estate Grown Red (Paso Robles),"All fruit and little structure. Blasts the palate with blackberries, cherries, chocolate, currant, vanilla and pastry flavors that are functionally sweet. Acidity is soft, emphasizing the glyceriney sweetness."
France,87,12,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Schröder & Schÿler 2012 Chartron la Fleur Merlot-Cabernet  (Bordeaux),"This soft, ripe wine is a blend of 70% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon. With black-currant fruit and bright acidity, the wine is fruity and ready to drink."
US,90,70,Chardonnay,white,ZD 2013 45th Anniversary Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros),"Rounded in baked and dried fruit aromas, this is a soft, gentle wine with tangy acidity and swathes of ripe apple and orange citrus. A backbone of subtle oak gives it structure and complexity, finishing lean and bright, with a darker, richer twist of vanilla and clove in the mix."
France,89,20,White Blend,white,Vignobles Brumont 2012 Château Bouscassé Les Jardins  (Pacherenc du Vic Bilh),"This blend of the very local Petit Courbu and Petit Manseng grapes comes from the same region as Madiran. The wine is dry but rich—very rich—with apricot and honey flavors. It has concentration, a great tang of lemon and just enough acidity to keep everything in order. This is ready to drink."
US,90,36,Chardonnay,white,Array 2013 Nina's Reserve Chardonnay (Washington),"Sur lie aging and battonage were extended for 22 months on this wine. It displays aromas of corn silk, almond milk and lees that are followed by an elegant creamy mouthfeel and abundant stone-fruit flavors. The finish lingers."
US,82,19,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Voss 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Yountville),"Green bean and bell pepper mark this wine that lacks flavor. It tastes watery and diluted, a faint hint of lemon lurking in."
France,93,90,Chardonnay,white,Philippe Colin 2014 Les Chaumées Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),"This comes from the northern end of the line-up of Premier Crus, which shows in the lively, crisp and tightly fruity character of the wine. It is developing slowly, still controlled and with light hints of toast. It will be a beautiful, bright wine. Drink from 2019."
US,91,42,Pinot Noir,red,Gary Farrell 2005 Russian River Selection Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This multivineyard blend isn't cheap, but it's almost as good as Farrell's more expensive single-vineyard Pinots, which makes it kind of a value. Like them, it's a dry, crisply acidic wine, and slightly austere. It shows tobacco-infused cherry pie filling, pomegranate, rhubarb and cola flavors."
US,90,45,Syrah,red,Ojai 2005 Roll Ranch Vineyard Syrah (California),"Despite the California appellation, the grapes were grown in the Ojai region of Santa Barbara County. It's a dry, tannic wine whose ripe blackberry, mocha and oak flavors are balanced with rich earthiness. Could develop bottle complexity over the next six years."
US,94,65,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Flora Springs 2008 Trilogy Red (Napa Valley),"A flashy, classy wine, grown in the estate vineyard in the benchlands and hills above Rutherford. Shows lots of sweet, ripe cherry fruit and toasty oak, but has enough of an acid-tannin structure to dry it out for balance. Should hold and develop over the next 6–8 years."
US,92,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Atalon 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Dry and crisp with acidity, this Sauvignon Blanc, with 3% Sémillon, was fermented in stainless steel but partially aged in neutral oak barrels. The palate shows complex flavors of citrus fruits, Asian pears, lychee, cashews, vanilla, minerals and white pepper, with a touch of honey. The grapes come from all around the valley, including the cooler Oak Knoll district as well as warmer St. Helena. A brilliant example of blending, and easy to find, with 10,000 cases produced."
US,89,37,Zinfandel,red,Papapietro Perry 2007 Pauline's Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"An interesting wine to dissect. It's very tannic, rather hot in alcohol, and super-spicy, with ripe to ultraripe flavors of wild blackberries, raspberries and currants. Feels a bit rustic and uncoordinated now, but could gain smoothness in a year or two. Certainly it's a very good example of Dry Creek Zin."
US,87,35,Red Blend,red,Insania 2009 Red (Red Mountain),"Produced by Three Rivers for celebrity winemaker Geoff Tate, the Insania is actually rather tame. Pretty fruit flavors of berry, cherry and plum introduce the wine gracefully, then run into some stiff, drying, chalky tannins."
US,90,50,Red Blend,red,Falkner 2012 Amante Red (Temecula Valley),"Italian varietals can excel in this SoCal zone, and this Sangiovese-led Super Tuscan blend is a prime example, with crushed graphite, tobacco, juicy blackberry and woodpile notes on the nose. Dried oregano, marjoram and thyme arise on the palate, with a sultry baked-plum flavor on the midpalate and pencil shavings and incense throughout."
US,93,30,Chardonnay,white,Stephen Ross 2014 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Mexican lime, crushed chalk, light jasmine, daffodil and lemon-lime soda show on the nose of this bottling by veteran Steve Dooley. Tight cement and lime-rind flavors pop on the palate, where a sharp kumquat quality dissects the Bosc-pear warmth and the nuanced influence of damp dill and other green herbs."
US,85,32,Syrah,red,Manzoni 2012 Home Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Black pepper, graphite and reluctant boysenberry notes balance the rubbery funk on the nose of this cool-climate Syrah. It's fairly light on the palate, with just-ripe boysenberry and chopped Italian herbs."
US,92,80,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Double Eagle 2012 Grieve Family Vineyard Red (Napa Valley),"Merlot from the family's vineyard in Lovall Valley informs the majority of this blend at 44%, with 36% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc in the wine as well. Dry and herbal, it sings in bold notes of red currant, cedar and anise, offering elegance around integrated tannins and a mouthcoating finish. Drink now through 2022."
US,84,42,Syrah,red,Hooker 2011 Home Pitch Block 1 Syrah (Knights Valley),"Jammy blackberry and cherry fruit flavors mark this wine, along with some strong tannins. It's not particularly complex, and doesn't have the balance for aging, so drink up."
US,81,9,Merlot,red,Happy Camper 2011 Merlot (California),"Drink this sharp, sweetish Merlot if someone gives it to you at a barbecue and don't complain. Put extra ketchup on the burger and enjoy."
France,93,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Lilian Ladouys 2014  Saint-Estèphe,"Under the ownership of Jacky Lorenzetti, president of one of France's top rugby clubs, this estate is now performing impressively. The wine is finely structured with dark tannins and tight acidity and a hint of minerality. It is Merlot dominated, although it is the 40% Cabernet Sauvignon that brings out the black-currant fruitiness. Drink from 2022."
Italy,87,15,Sangiovese,red,Mazzei 2004 Poggio alla Badiola Sangiovese (Toscana),"Sangiovese with 25% Merlot for added softness and dimension, this wine boasts pretty notes of cherry, blue flowers, toasted almonds and exotic spice. It has nice elegance overall but is a bit compact in the mouth."
US,89,24,Zinfandel,red,Girard 2012 Old Vine Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"An 85% Zinfandel with smaller amounts of Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and Syrah, this red offers sanguine, rustic plum, cinnamon spice and a concentration of bright red fruit, a lingering grip on the finish."
France,92,30,Pinot Gris,white,Domaines Schlumberger 2012 Kessler Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"There are mere hints of beeswax and marzipan on the nose. The palate opens into a structured, bright and well-lit space of pear peel, pear juice and a wonderfully bitter edge. This is off-dry and concentrated, definite but with a light touch. There is an intriguing hint of bitter orange peel that draws you in and pull this onto a higher plane."
US,88,30,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Terre Rouge 2013 L'Autre Red (Sierra Foothills),"Flavors like wild berries blend with smoke and rosemary in this full-bodied, full-flavored and firmly tannic wine. It is big in texture and high in aromatic intensity. Made of 72% Grenache, 19% Syrah and 9% Mourvèdre."
US,85,14,Chardonnay,white,Liberty School 2014 Chardonnay (Central Coast),"Extremely light on aromas, this bottling eventually shows lemon peel, chalk and slate. The palate is simple yet clean, with flavors of pear, nectarine and lime peels."
US,91,28,Pinot Noir,red,Alexana 2016 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This rosé brings extra levels of finesse and detail along with the expected burst of fresh fruit. Elegant and sophisticated, it offers tart cherry fruit, some peppery herb and a hint of fresh-ground coffee. Barrel fermented in neutral oak, it's smooth as silk."
US,86,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Tyler Florence 2009 Blend #5 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a soft, somewhat one-dimensional Cab. It has jammy flavors of blackberries and cherries, with the vanilla and toast of oak barrel aging. Drink now."
US,93,38,Chardonnay,white,Patz & Hall 2013 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"A well-crafted blending from several marquee vineyards within the producer's portfolio, this is a subtle, flirty and floral white, vibrant and dusted in minerality. An intense back beat of oak and power balances on the finish, in between a flurry of complex, compelling pear, apple and salty hazelnut."
US,85,17,Sangiovese,red,Maryhill 2010 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Chalky and dry, this tastes of barely ripe cherry, with plenty of leafy flavors. The tannins take over quickly in a brief, drying finish."
US,90,20,Chardonnay,white,Columbia Crest 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Horse Heaven Hills),"Despite the wine being fermented and aged in 100% new French oak, the fruit shines through, with notes of corn silk, peach and tropical fruit accented by barrel spices. Texture and richness to the sweet fruit flavors keeps interest high."
US,92,56,Pinot Noir,red,Foxen 2009 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"With 50% new oak aging, the wood stands out now, showing caramelized and buttered toast flavors. Under that is a dry, tannic wine, filled with raspberries, cherries and spicy pomegranates. Complex and pedigreed, it wants some time in the cellar. Better after 2014."
US,90,39,Red Blend,red,Cedarville Vineyard 2012 Turnabout's Fair Play Red (Fair Play),"Hints of charred wood and fresh-cracked black pepper meet tasty baked-fruit flavors in this full-bodied, rather rugged wine made from Grenache, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a good, firm and moderately tannic texture."
France,93,80,Riesling,white,Cave du Roi Dagobert 2013 Altenberg-Bergbieten Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"A touch of evolution is immediately apparent: that chamomile lift and dried citrus peel nose gives it away. The  dry palate then serves up notions of ripe but tart apple, incisive lemon freshness and a more generous, fluid rich texture that play off each other beautifully. On the finish it is the lemon that shines, alongside some notions of candle wax and more chamomile. A lovely snapshot of a Riesling on its trajectory. Drink 2017-2027."
US,93,85,Merlot,red,Elyse 2012 Hossfeld Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"From a vineyard 1,500 feet above the valley floor in Soda Canyon, blended with 4% Cabernet Sauvignon from Morisoli Vineyard, this is a beautiful beast of a wine, concentrated in red cherry and plum as well as mocha. Nicely weighted with soft tannin and length, it's well made and should age. Drink now through 2020."
US,94,60,Pinot Noir,red,Pisoni 2006 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Exceptionally fine. Effortlessly combines the impressive power and authority the vineyard is known for with sensual elegance. The flavors of currants, cherries, cola, balsam and clovespice are mouth-watering. Such is the balance of tannins, acids, oak and all other parts that the wine should improve over the next six years, then hold for several more."
US,88,24,Syrah,red,Fields Family 2013 Estate Grown Syrah (Lodi),"Bright black cherry animates the aromas and flavors of this medium-bodied wine. It is firm in texture, not too complicated or overripe, but just nice and easy to drink."
US,91,45,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Brian Carter Cellars 2012 Trentenaire Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Petit Verdot (62%) takes the lead on this blend, followed by Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. The flower, green herb, coffee and barrel spice aromas are brooding, while the palate offers bright acids, firm tannins and a spot-on sense of balance."
US,93,38,Zinfandel,red,Dry Creek Vineyard 2011 Somers Ranch Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"The cool vintage was a challenge, which speaks well of the winery's vineyard team. Blended with 5% Petite Sirah, the wine is unusually complex and sumptuous, even by Dry Creek standards. The flavors are rich with wild summer blueberries and blackberries, and savory with pepper and other exotic spices."
US,90,40,Pinot Noir,red,La Rochelle 2005 Paraiso Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"The vineyard has been a consistent source of good to great Pinot Noirs for Paraiso winery. Now La Rochelle dips into it, with successful results. It's a dry, elegantly silky but complex wine, with an array of cherry, raspberry, rose flower, cinnamon spice and smoky vanilla flavors, heightened with crisp acidity. Drink now."
US,90,30,Chardonnay,white,Girard 2009 Dutton Ranch - Mill Station Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This is a rich, complex Chardonnay that's made to appeal to fans of the variety. Acidity brightens the green apple, peach and pear flavors, while oak brings notes of buttered toast and caramel. The alcohol is a little high and warm, making the wine ready to drink now."
US,85,45,Pinot Noir,red,Kason 2014 Dijon 777 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"One of a series of single-clone offerings from Kason, this pushes the ripeness to its limits. Nonetheless, the black-fruit flavors can't compete with the intense charred-wood character. Bitter tannins take over the finish."
US,90,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Pear Valley 2010 Distraction Red (Paso Robles),"There are black plums, iron, iodine, fudge, espresso and a touch of squid ink aromas on the nose of this blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 14% Cabernet Franc, 10% Malbec and 6% Petit Verdot. The palate is driven by fudge and chocolate, showing plum jam fruits and noticeable oak and cedar smoke elements."
Italy,91,60,Red Blend,red,Zenato 2012  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"Aromas of black currant, blue flower, tilled soil, menthol and cedar take center stage. The dense palate delivers mature black cherry, crushed raspberry, mocha, vanilla, nutmeg and a confectionery note. Velvety tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2022."
US,91,40,Chardonnay,white,Hollywood & Vine 2001 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Smooth and creamy textured, with lovely toast and spice notes up front. Melon, pear, apple, mandarine orange and lemon flavors are evenly balanced. The wine is crisp and clean on the finish, yet also long and fresh. -J.M."
US,93,50,Chardonnay,white,Ojai 2006 Solomon Hills Special Bottling Two Barrels Made Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"With 15% residual sugar, this dessert wine is decidedly sweet in apricot, pineapple, pear, honey, vanilla fudge and smoky flavors, with a brisk minerality. It maintains a zesty balance, with crisp acidity."
US,86,12,Sangiovese,red,Vino 2015 Rosé Sangiovese (Washington),"A very pretty pale salmon color, cherry and spice aromas are followed by light, tart, dry, mouthwatering fruit flavors. The concentration seems light but there's still much to enjoy."
US,92,35,Pinot Noir,red,Torii Mor 1998 Eason Vineyard Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Intense and earthy aromas of perfectly ripe berries, chocolate and a little natural funk in the form of mushroom. The highlight of this beauty is the cushy, plummy mouth, which is complex, cool and ultimately sublime. A real playboy of a Pinot, which opens up sensationally if given an hour's breathing. Only 116 cases made."
US,86,20,Merlot,red,Maddalena 2011 Merlot (Paso Robles),"This wine plays with the herbal, slightly green side of the Bordeaux grape, with oregano, thyme and just-cracked pepper spicing up the soft red strawberry and plum fruit on the nose. Dried herbs show strongly on the palate, alongside elderberry fruit and cedar."
US,90,36,Syrah,red,Ott & Murphy 2013 Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Aromas of mineral, dried herb and plum are followed by fruit flavors that display depth and purity. It shows a lovely sense of elegance."
US,93,50,Chardonnay,white,Thomas Fogarty 2009 Portola Springs Vineyard Estate Grown Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"The closest thing in California you can get to a great French Chablis, this is absolutely dry, high in acidity and streamlined. It offers tantalizing citrus rind and peach fruit flavors, with a savory taste of cold minerals. Fans of rich, buttery Chardonnay will find it lean, but if you have a cellar, age it for six years and see how it evolves."
US,86,23,Chardonnay,white,Shannon Ridge 2014 High Elevation Collection Chardonnay (Lake County),"This is a polished and attractive medium-bodied wine. It offers classic apple and pear aromas, and light vanilla and nutmeg flavors. Balanced a little toward softness rather than crispness, it's very easy in texture."
US,86,28,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Two Mountain 2010 Copeland Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),"This pure Cabernet spent 22 months in a mix of French and American oak, though what percentage was new is not stated. It enters the palate with a pleasing mix of cassis, tar and a hint of mint, then seems to hit a wall and fade."
US,88,13,Riesling,white,Firesteed 2010 Riesling (Oregon),"Done in a ripe and fleshy style, this vintage is in its prime drinking window. Mixed peach, lemon, stone and citrus fruit, along with a slice of honeydew melon, make this a mouth-filling, all-purpose Riesling, with barely perceptible sweetness."
US,92,24,Syrah,red,La Clarine Farm 2010 Suma Kaw Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"Suma Kaw has been a vaunted vineyard source for some of the best Syrah in the Foothills. Opening with a gust of peppercorn and an herbal thread of pine, this Syrah dances on the edge of being overwhelming, with intense tannins weaving between the flavors of bright red fruit and smoky meat. It's enjoyable now, and will drink well in several years, too."
US,88,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Northstar 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This starts with a startling but tangy lemon-tea flavor. Cinnamon and plum notes enter the palate, which are underscored by rather chalky acidity, and finished with a coffee highlight."
US,83,12,Pinot Noir,red,Red Pony Ranch 2011 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"A simple Pinot Noir, this is dry and crisp in acidity, with cherry pie, mint and cola flavors."
France,87,25,Chardonnay,white,Antonin Rodet 2011  Pouilly-Fuissé,"This is a big, fat Chardonnay—at least in Burgundy terms. It has a ripe yellow-fruit flavor, a rich texture and soft acidity. Subtle wood influence gives further roundness to this almost pebble-smooth wine. It's delicious now, and it's likely to develop quickly."
US,82,13,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Rosenblum 2011 Vintner's Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Sharp in acidity and thin in fruit, this simple Cabernet has dry flavors of sour candy, blackberry, currant and herb."
France,90,26,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Lamothe de Haux 2011  Côtes de Bordeaux,"This perfumed wine shows a floral character. Berry fruits add juiciness, complexity and structure. Density on the finish adds interest."
France,83,13,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Le Grand Moulin 2012 Grande Réserve  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"The wine is ripe and soft with a body of tannin that sits uneasily within this jammy character. The blend (Merlot 75%, Cabernet Franc 25%, Malbec 5%) was aged 30% in barrel and 70% in stainless steel tanks. It is unbalanced and likely to remain so."
US,83,8,Pinot Grigio,white,Peltier 2011 Hybrid Pinot Grigio (Lodi),"This blend of 75% Pinot Grigio and 15% Vermentino is a light, simple quaff with some snap to it and not much on the finish."
France,88,20,Chardonnay,white,Cave de Lugny 2011 La Carte  (Mâcon-Lugny),"This is a single vineyard wine, richly textured and ripe. It shows the lively acidity of the vintage along with a warm feel that brings out peaches and green plums. Age for a couple of years or drink now."
US,89,45,Syrah,red,Kasia 2014 Syrah (Red Mountain),"This is the inaugural release from this winery. It opens with aromas of raspberries, herbs and cherries, showing just a touch of volatility. The fruit and barrel flavors are ripe and generous, lingering on the finish."
US,87,24,Red Blend,red,Longboard 2013 Point Break Red (North Coast),"This 2013 keeps up the full body and ripe fruit of previous releases, with lush texture and saturated chocolate and blackberry flavors. It's a dry red, however, with no detectable sweetness but plenty of tannin and satisfaction."
US,86,36,Syrah,red,Deep Sea 2008 White Hawk Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"The black pepper and cocoa flavors that always mark this fine vineyard show up again in this dry, tannic wine. So do the blackberries and cassis that make it so sweetly fruity. The acidity is awkward, though, and tastes like it was added to balance out a high alcohol wine."
US,93,40,Pinot Noir,red,Holman Ranch 2010 Hunter's Cuvee Pinot Noir (Carmel Valley),"There's a touch of forest floor funk on this wine, but the nose also shows lots of stewed black cherries, chemise and mint-chocolate chip. The palate is deep and rich but not overly ripe, with raspberry and elderberry fruit cut by herbal seasonings of oregano, thyme, marjoram and mint."
US,84,17,Syrah,red,Maryhill 2009 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a typical, standard style of Syrah, that tastes strongly of vanilla rather than of the actual grape. The fruit is muted, but the vanilla and tobacco flavors stand out."
US,86,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Vigilance 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Red Hills Lake County),"This tastes bright and lively, just a bit sweet and brimming with fruit flavor. It smells like green apples and grapefruit, tastes like honeydew melon and adds a bit of acidity to balance out the ripeness."
Italy,93,45,Red Blend,red,Il Conventino 2012 Riserva  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"Violet, perfumed berry, new leather, cinnamon and mint aromas follow through to the elegant palate, lifting its juicy core of plum and ripe Morello cherry flavors. A licorice note signals the close while firm, fine-grained and polished tannins provide support. Drink 2018–2027."
Italy,89,52,Red Blend,red,Tenute Sella 2009 San Sebastiano allo Zoppo  (Lessona),"Underbrush, scorched earth, espresso and exotic spice aromas open. The taut, linear palate offers dried sour cherry, coffee bean and grilled sage alongside a backbone of austere, fine-grained tannins that leave a firm finish."
Italy,88,15,Red Blend,red,La Cignozza 2011  Chianti,"Aromas of red berry, sunbaked earth and crushed blue flower lead the nose. The easy-drinking palate offers mature wild cherry, white pepper and anise alongside polished tannins. It's simple but savory. Drink through 2016."
US,90,28,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Foxen 7200 2015 Vogelzang Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"Sweet-leaning aromas of apple, nectarine and mandarin orange are cut by a wet-cement aroma on the nose of this bottling. It's light and easy in style on the palate, with lime rind and chalk flavors. It's altogether quite mellow but very refreshing and quaffable."
France,86,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Julian 2012 Alter Ego  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"Ripe and fruity, this rounded, open wine reveals its fruit quickly. Red berries and soft tannins complete the character to give a bright wine that will be ready to drink mid-2015."
US,86,46,Syrah,red,Tolosa 2006 1772 Edna Ranch Syrah (Edna Valley),"A solid Syrah, dry and full-bodied, but not quite up to the last three vintages. Although there are savory blackberry and currant flavors, there's also a tough mintiness, and the mouthfeel is a bit scoury. Drink soon."
US,88,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Telaya 2014 Boushey Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),"Coming from a site best known for its Syrah, this wine offers aromas of berry compote, funk and potpourri. The palate shows a pleasing sense of purity, with lightly astringent tannins providing a bit of distraction."
US,91,45,Chardonnay,white,Foley 2014 T Anchor Ranch Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Tight and wound up on the nose, this bottling shows lime blossom and tangerine skin aromas with laser-sharp focus. Tangerine, sea salt and lime flavors show on the palate, where flinty minerality accents all that lush citrus."
US,85,14,Pinot Noir,red,Prophecy 2014 Pinot Noir (California),"This wine blends an earthy aroma with plenty of soft, almost sweet fruit character and a gentle, easy-drinking texture."
US,85,42,Red Blend,red,HammerSky NV Open Invitation Estate Grown Red (Paso Robles),"Jammy and sharp in acids, like liquid cherry and blackberry jam mixed with 14.8% of alcohol. Not particularly subtle, but offers a rich flood of ripe fruits spiced up with pepper, anise and cinnamon."
France,90,22,Riesling,white,Domaine Allimant-Laugner 2011 Praelatenberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"A serious wine that needs aging, this is full and ripe while also having a steely edge to it. Very perfumed, floral and strongly textured, this is an impressive wine that does need extended aging. Drink from 2016."
Italy,84,18,Sangiovese,red,Villa Vignamaggio 2008 Castello di Spaltenna  (Chianti Classico),"This Sangiovese and Syrah blend opens with slightly burnt aromas of tar and campfire, and it has background notes of dried fruit and leather. It feels dry and a bit flat on the finish."
France,94,190,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Léoville Las Cases 2003  Saint-Julien,"This is massive, hugely concentrated, topped with wood and intense tannins. Flavors of bitter chocolate are dominant, heavy fruits, blackberries and texture that fills the mouth with dark, dense flavors. Big in all senses."
US,88,80,Red Blend,red,Newton 2008 The Puzzle Red (Spring Mountain District),"Couldn't get any riper, with an explosion of blackberries, cherries, currants, plums, and cola, not to mention plenty of toasty, caramelized oak. Trades complexity and subtlety for sheer power. It's mostly Merlot, with a splash of Syrah, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc."
Italy,85,11,Sangiovese,red,Fattoria San Michele a Torri 2010  Chianti Colli Fiorentini,"A light and informal expression of Sangiovese with a very attractive price tag, this easy-going effort would pair perfectly with sausage pizza or homemade pasta sauce. There are touches of bitter almond and bright berry on the finish."
US,86,38,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Chateau Rollat 2011 Rollat Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The fig, licorice and spice aromas seem somewhat dried out and tired. The cherry and cranberry flavors are smooth, with the tannins showing some grit. Drink now."
Italy,87,18,Red Blend,red,Batzella 2012 Digià Red (Toscana),"A blend of 80% Cabernet and 20% Syrah, this easygoing wine offers blackberry and red currant sensations accented with notes of cracked black pepper. Round tannins make this extremely accessible so enjoy soon."
France,86,18,Chardonnay,white,Jean-Claude Debeaune 2015  Saint-Véran,"This wine is crisp, tangy and bright with acidity. With a lively touch of vanilla and spice over the crisp fruitiness, it is developing well. Drink from 2018."
France,87,22,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Barreyre 2015  Bordeaux Supérieur,"This fruity wine is full of cherry and blackberry flavors. It has a soft texture, lightly spiced and with an attractive balance of acidity and firmer tannins. Drink from 2018."
US,86,52,Syrah,red,Dilecta 2011 Unorthodox Caliza Vineyards / Alta Colina Vineyards Syrah (Paso Robles),"This 100% varietal wine shows its warm-climate origins in the exceptionally ripe cherry, blackberry and dark chocolate flavors. It's also quite high in alcohol, which gives it some prickly heat as well as a raisiny, Port-like aftertaste."
US,92,55,Pinot Noir,red,Fullerton 2015 Lichtenwalter Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"This vineyard designate made from 777 clone Pinot Noir was fermented in single-use barrels and aged in neutral wood. It's graceful, seductive and loaded with baking spice, cinnamon toast and mocha highlights. It's drinking beautifully at the moment, so no need to wait."
France,92,70,Chardonnay,white,Olivier Leflaive 2014 Les Pierres  (Chassagne-Montrachet),This wine is produced from a range of small parcels right through the appellation (including some Premier Crus) to give a full ripe wine that has great acidity as well as spice from the wood aging. It is a wine that shows elegance as well as concentration and a fine balance between fruit and acidity. Drink from 2018.
US,87,36,White Blend,white,The Infinite Monkey Theorem NV The Blind Watchmaker White (Colorado),"Expressive, honeyed white currant, banana purée and peach aromas give this blend of Viognier and Roussanne depth. The palate is smooth, lush and weighty, and it ends with some warmth and flower tones."
France,93,105,Chardonnay,white,Olivier Leflaive 2009 Charmes Premier Cru  (Meursault),"The vintage as well as the vineyard gave this hugely rich wine. It has weight, concentrated fruit and toast flavors, the acidity on line right through the center. Peach, pineapple and grapefruit combine to give an impressive, textured fruitiness. Age for 2–3 years."
France,93,105,Pinot Noir,red,Domaines Devillard 2011 Domaine des Perdrix Aux Perdrix Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),"A dense wine, rich and smooth for a Nuits-St-Georges, full of ripe red fruits, dark cherries and acidity that almost gives the wine a fresh character. Behind this fruitiness is a more solid, dark structure of tannins that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2018."
France,87,30,Chardonnay,white,Maison Matisco 2014  Pouilly-Fuissé,"This wine is ripe yet still crisp, with a touch of honey flavor and apricot fruit lending ripeness, pulled taut by a tang of orange zest-like acidity. It's delicious and ready to drink, finishing on mineral texture."
France,95,170,Pinot Noir,red,Louis Latour 2014 Château Corton Grancey  (Corton),"This is a blend from several Grand Crus on the Corton hill. It is rich and spicy, with great black fruits and solid tannins. A powerful wine, it's shot through with acidity and black-plum fruits throughout the structure. Drink from 2023."
US,87,20,Chardonnay,white,Sarah's Vineyard 2014 Chardonnay (Santa Clara Valley),"This bottling from the Dwarf Oak Vineyard offers pear, struck flint and smoked nut aromas, with the slightest hint of tropicality. The palate is rich with melted butter and roasted macadamia nut flavors—due, perhaps, to the warmer valley climate."
US,89,30,Pinot Noir,red,Spindrift Cellars 2014 Barrel Select Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This medium-bodied wine is already drinking optimally, with a core of red fruit streaked with cola, earth, graphite and citrus notes. Only four barrels were produced."
US,93,45,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Dunham 2010 XVI Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The sixteenth edition of Dunham's benchmark Cabernet Sauvignon bears a strong scent of new oak—it's aged in 70% French and 30% American. The wood is dominant, which is not surprising in a wine built for long term aging. Given plenty of time to breathe, bright red fruits, citrusy acids and a lovely mix of toast, caramel and clove accents emerge."
US,93,70,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Elyse 2008 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"This wine contains a drop of Petit Verdot. At more than five years of age, it has shed its babyfat, and is starting to develop bottle complexity. You can certainly drink it now for its luscious red cherry, blueberry, licorice and spice flavors. The tannins are as velvety smooth as anything in Napa Valley. However, it's guaranteed to continue to develop well in the bottle. Hold until 2018, at the very least."
France,86,12,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Marquis de Goulaine 2016 Les Landelles Sauvignon Blanc (Touraine),"With its crisp red-currant fruits and strongly herbal character, this is a ripe wine with intense acidity. It is crisply textured and concentrated. Drink now."
US,86,20,Red Blend,red,Fatty Pope 2014 Red (Paso Robles),"Featuring a fat, short, ornately dressed holy man on the label, this is one of the most visually compelling brands to hit the market in a while, but the wine inside isn't so exciting. Black fruit and slight licorice show on the nose, with blackberry and cola on the palate."
US,93,45,Syrah,red,K Vintners 2008 Morrison Lane Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"With its excellent concentration of pure fruit power, this is like taking your mouth through a 100 yard dash of raspberry, blueberry and black cherry fruit, right down the heart of the throat. Along the way you find a tight wrapping of rock and espresso, but it's the snappy, sappy fruit that really shines here. Great length."
Italy,87,28,Red Blend,red,Monterotondo 2011 Seretina Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"A blend of organically farmed Sangiovese and 5% Malvasia Nera, this opens with aromas of scorched earth, underbrush and roasted coffee bean. Reflecting the hot vintage, the palate is evolved, offering raisin and dark spice alongside firm tannins. The fruit richness is already drying up so drink sooner rather than later."
US,91,55,Pinot Noir,red,Fess Parker 2014 Pommard Clone Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Boysenberry, black plum, condensed rose petal and cola touches show on the nose of this clonal selection, which offers very purple-seeming aromas. Ripe black cherry fruit leads the palate, followed by rounded vanilla notes, over a backdrop of thyme, bay leaf and graphite."
US,89,22,Chardonnay,white,Wood Family Vineyards 2009 Para Mas Amigas Chardonnay (Livermore Valley),"This impressive Chardonnay from a small Livermore Valley producer is on the austere side of Chardonnay, with notes of just-ripe pear, tiny hints of wet stone, a nice, nutty finish and enough body to go with a wealth of foods. Good balance too."
US,89,20,Merlot,red,Rancho Sisquoc 2013 Merlot (Santa Barbara County),"Blueberries and black cherries meet with rose petals, dark chocolate, brown spice and black tea on the nose of this bottling from a historic vineyard. The mouthfeel is soft with creamy tannins that grow grippier across the sip, showing cedar, black-cherry mousse, baking spice and a tinge of acidity."
US,86,14,Pinot Noir,red,Parducci 2013 Small Lot Blend Pinot Noir (California),"This has a relatively light, traditional color with a brownish rim, complex aromas of cedar and bay leaf, with dry, mature flavors supported by firm acidity and tannins. Medium bodied and rather lean in flavor intensity, it's made in an enjoyable, lean style."
US,88,30,Chardonnay,white,Michael Shaps 2013 Wild Meadow Vineyard Chardonnay (Virginia),"Roasted hazelnut with grilled pineapple and peach carry the aromas and palate of this vineyard-designate Chardonnay. Having spent 11 months in French oak (33% new), the wine shows barrel tones, however a bright acidity helps keep things alive and fresh."
US,90,14,Riesling,white,Kings Ridge 2014 Riesling (Willamette Valley),"This outstanding Riesling brings a bouquet of rose petals and peaches. There's enough bright acidity to push flavors of lime and grapefruit forward, and the wine drinks dry despite relatively low alcohol."
Italy,86,11,White Blend,white,Ruffino 2012  Orvieto,"This opens with pretty aromas of wild white flowers and pear. The palate is light and fresh, with a core of yellow apple, Williams pear and tropical fruit, with a crisp, quenching finish. Pair it with mild seafood dishes or light pastas."
Italy,90,22,Sangiovese,red,Carpineto 1998 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Like many wines from this producer, it excels because of its sheer drinkability. They are using more new wood flavors than in the past, but the beautifully perfumed, vibrant fruit, deep acidity and light elegance reveal a wine that will age well, as well as being drinkable now."
US,89,125,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Axios 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Lush, soft and delicious, this has flavors of chocolate, ripe crushed summer blackberries and a hint of dried currants. This richness is augmented by lots of smoky, sweet oak. It could develop in the bottle, but the fruit might fall out before the tannins soften."
France,89,40,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Claude Riffault 2014 Les Denisottes  (Sancerre),"Coming from a single vineyard, this rich wine has concentration as well as ripe yellow and green fruits. It's a wine to age for a few more months to bring out all its complexity. Drink from 2017."
US,90,48,Pinot Noir,red,Lachini 2010 Lachini Family Estate Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"The winery's top cuvée is notable for its perfume of rose petals with a subtle whiff of body talc. Balanced and feminine, this soft and graceful wine glides across the palate with flavor highlights of cherries and plums. Drink now while it's at its best."
US,96,125,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Vineyard 7&8 2008 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"It's hard to exaggerate the purity of this wine, which is 100% Cabernet. It startles for the intensity of mountain blackberries and raspberries, and then a firm minerality kicks in, along with the tannins, providing grounding structure. The finish lasts for a full minute. Winemaker Luc Morlet has really hit the jackpot with this dry, spectacularly complex young wine, which will develop for at least a decade."
France,87,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Maison Noble 2011  Bordeaux,"This new-wood-dominated wine is ripe, but full of caramel and mint flavors. The fruit is more discreet, just hinting at blackberry richness. The potential to achieve balance in six months is all here."
US,87,15,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Rock Wall 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),"The tech sheet for this wine nicely mentions how the vineyard is surrounded by both 100-year-old walnut trees and, what do you know?, marijuana. Does either influence the wine? It does show a muskiness but really its strengths are steely drops of extreme lemon, most decidedly on the long, exuberant finish."
France,91,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Siaurac 2014  Lalande de Pomerol,"The ample fruitiness of this 80% Merlot wine is right up front. It comes from a large 116-acre estate on the extension of the Pomerol plateau. Firm tannins as well as generous black plum and berry fruits are well balanced, just needing time to soften and fill out. Drink this full, rich wine from 2018."
France,85,16,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château de la Vieille Tour 2014  Bordeaux Blanc,"Fruity and crisp, this is an attractive lemon and pear-flavored wine from certified organic vineyards. With fresh, balanced acidity and a creamy texture, this 60% Sauvignon and 40% Sémillon blend is ready to drink."
Italy,87,25,Red Blend,red,Corte San Benedetto 2010  Valpolicella Ripasso,"This offers aromas of bell pepper and raisin, with a whiff of toast. The warm, round palate shows ripe black-fruit flavors, layered with red-bell-pepper and coffee accents. You'll also notice an alcoholic warmth to the close."
US,91,70,Pinot Noir,red,Scott Paul 2013 Azana Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Previously lableled Quatre Journaux, this is now vineyard-designated, but otherwise everything remains unchanged. It's a pretty wine, with rhubarb and red-plum fruit. Further details of orange peel and chocolate emerge as it opens. The perfectly balanced acids and tannins suggest it will thrive in the cellar. Drink now–2006."
US,93,80,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Duckhorn 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Held back for more than four years, this Cab remains tough in tannins and lush in primary fruits. It's as ripe as any '09 out there, with black cherry, currant, chocolate and roasted coconut flavors. A succulent sweetness runs throughout, despite the absolutely dry finish. Hold until 2018, and if you have more than one bottle, drink one every additional year."
US,92,55,Pinot Noir,red,Bernardus 2015 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"For those wondering what minerality means in a red wine, this bottling is the answer. Against the black cherry and dark strawberry on the nose rise powerful crushed slate and smashed graphite aromas. The palate starts with cranberry and pomegranate, but the slate and rocky-soil flavors swing back in, giving backbone to the hints of bay leaf and herbs."
US,89,22,Chardonnay,white,Adelsheim 2010 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Fine balance is a hallmark for all Adelsheim wines. This shows a mix of citrus and apple fruit, with the tartness of gooseberries as a nod to the cooler vintage. There is some pleasing complexity, with an emphasis on herbs and high-acid fruits."
US,84,20,Red Blend,red,Domaine Pouillon NV Black Dot Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"This is a nonvintage blend of Zinfandel, Syrah, Grenache and Cinsault. Well on its way to maturity, it's an easy-drinking quaffer, with a hint of bitterness on the finish."
US,86,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Oberon 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is elaborate, but too soft for a great Napa Cabernet. That absence of structure accentuates its ripeness, giving it tastes of candied cherry and licorice. On the plus side, it's dry and smooth, with lots of smoky new French oak. Drink now."
US,91,44,Pinot Noir,red,Bailiwick 2013 Foray Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Plummy and tight, this wine comes from the Green Valley section of the Russian River Valley. Youthful, it hints at fierce acidity around delicately woven specks of mint, pine forest, rhubarb and clove. In the background, the region's classic cola cherry characteristic shows as well. Drink now through 2021."
France,92,45,Chardonnay,white,Château de Lavernette 2014 Vers Châne  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"A silky ripe wine that has great yellow and white stone fruits. That is contrasted with a strongly mineral character, touches of honey and intense acidity. The wine is still young but it has a delicious future. Drink starting from 2019."
US,90,70,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Midnight 2013 Zenith Red (Paso Robles Willow Creek District),"Tightly wound on the nose at first, this blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 13% Malbec and 12% Petit Verdot opens slowly to show blackberry, anise and baking spice on the nose. The palate offers boysenberry, slate, oregano and bay leaf, wrapped in decent tannins and acidity. Patience will allow this wine to come into its own."
US,87,32,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Kenwood 2014 Jack London Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Mountain),"A strong thread of menthol eucalyptus plays along the palate of this wine, which offers a full-bodied firmness of grippy leather and bright red fruit. It finishes with a soft simple end."
Italy,90,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Machiavelli 2001 Ser Niccolò Cabernet Sauvignon (Toscana),"Here's a lofty, noble Cab that boasts great power and intensity. The nose is redolent of black plum, spice, green leaf, molasses and a touch of cinnamon. Firm tannins and thick density back its penetrating effect."
US,86,21,Pinot Gris,white,Methven Family Vineyards 2011 Barrel Fermented Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Soft and lightly oaky, this barrel-fermented wine has a lightly honeyed element, perhaps an indication of botrytis. The wine should be consumed young, as it is already showing signs of age in both color and mouthfeel."
France,84,16,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Simonnet-Febvre 2012  Saint-Bris,"A soft, fruity wine, this features attractive citrus and peach flavors. It's light and fresh with a crisp, bright aftertaste. Saint-Bris is the only appellation in Burgundy to produce Sauvignon Blanc."
Italy,89,20,Red Blend,red,PoderNuovo a Palazzone 2012 Therra Red (Toscana),"Made of 48% Sangiovese, 35% Montepulciano, 10% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has black-skinned fruit and baking spice aromas. The firm palate delivers black cherry, black currant and tobacco notes in a frame of fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020."
US,91,48,Pinot Noir,red,Montemar Wines 2012 Bentrock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Fresh and broad aromas of strawberry syrup meet with eucalyptus oil and wild mint on the clean if simple nose of this bottling. It grows more tart on the sip, with roasted red plum, cranberry and pomegranate, but the fascinating parts are the curious hints of cannabis and hops, which give herbal depth to the fruit."
US,88,24,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Mercy 2016 Zabala Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Arroyo Seco),"The nose on this bottling is quite reductive at first, with cut grass and damp herb aromas mixing up with dried seaweed and light lemon peel. There is a tart green-grass flavor to the palate, but also a slightly riper Anjou pear component, with a salty freshness emerging toward the finish."
US,89,38,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Savage Grace 2014 Red Willow Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),"A unique take on this variety that saw no new oak, this wine reveals aromas of cigar box, dried herb and dark fruit. The palate brings a fine sense of purity and detail to the raspberry and cherry flavors, trailing ever so slightly toward the finish."
France,89,25,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Patrice Moreux 2014 Corty Artisan Silex  (Pouilly-Fumé),"The flint soil behind this wine gives it a stony, smoky character that is allied to the mineral texture. It's a ripe wine, still young with pure fruit and an intense acidity. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2018."
US,88,22,Rhône-style Red Blend,red,Chronic Cellars 2014 Sofa King Bueno Red (Paso Robles),"One of the Chronic brothers' most beloved bottlings, this blend of 46% Syrah, 27% Grenache, 22% Petite Sirah, 3% Mourvèdre and 2% Tannat shows vibrant and fresh aromas of boysenberries, cola and lavender on the nose. It's easy to enjoy once sipped, with red currant, red plum and cranberry flavors gaining depth from oregano and marjoram herbs."
US,93,29,Chardonnay,white,Irvine Family Vineyards 2013 Chardonnay (Oregon),"This wine explodes with a glorious mix of buttered nuts, toast, ripe yellow fruits and supporting acidity. The exceptional length proposes at least a decade of development ahead. Drink now through 2025."
US,95,65,Pinot Noir,red,Aether Wine Company 2014 Matrix Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"This blend of Quinta del Mar and Drum Canyon vineyards makes for a very powerful and attention-demanding wine. Sultry aromas of roasted red cherry and caramelized berry meet with well-integrated clove and allspice on the potent nose. The palate explodes with ripe but acid-cut blackberry and raspberry syrup flavors, with thyme, star anise and more dark spices rounding out the power."
France,90,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Henry Marionnet 2016 Vignes Françaises Sauvignon Blanc (Touraine),"This wine comes from ungrafted vines, planted in 2000, a rare phenomenon because of phylloxera. It may be because of that origin, that the wine has its own creamy intensity or it may just be a fine wine anyway. It is rich and full of creamed apples and finely balanced acidity. Drink now."
US,85,44,Red Blend,red,Cathedral Ridge 2007 Rock Star Red Red (Columbia Valley (OR)),"The Rock Star Red is a 50/50 Cabernet/Syrah blend. The two grapes work well together in many wines, but here they seem a bit at odds. The Cabernet carries some green, herbal, pickle barrel flavors; the Syrah brings in pepper and spice, but neither has the ripeness to flesh out the wine sufficiently. There are flavors of plum and cooked cherry, then it hits some chewy tannins and stops short."
France,90,29,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Domaine Seguin 2011  Pouilly-Fumé,"Initially youthfully crisp and herbaceous, the wine then broadens into riper more yellow-fruit flavors. That gives it richness and weight that balance with the grapefruit and lemon-juice freshness. Give this fine wine a year to meld together"
US,82,20,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Magness 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Give this soft, simple Cab a little time to blow off some unpleasant odors. After a while, it clears, and the wine turns acceptable in berry-cherry flavor."
France,89,18,Pinot Gris,white,Joseph Fritsch 2015 Lieu-dit Altenburg Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Honeysuckle notes hover over ripe pears. The palate boosts these notions even more with some residual sweetness that enhances the fruitiness. Edged with pleasant pithiness, the finish is off dry but balanced."
Italy,89,20,Sangiovese,red,Casisano Colombaio 2011  Rosso di Montalcino,"This delightful rosso has enticing fragrances of violet, iris and red berry. The bright palate delivers wild cherry, white pepper and mint flavors framed by silky tannins. This is made to be drunk young, so enjoy soon."
US,92,30,Chardonnay,white,Migration 2010 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"With a creamy mouthfeel and ripe flavors of tangerines, tropical fruits, honey and sweet oak, this is a flashy effort. It will appeal to fans of the variety, and rightfully so, delivering a dry complexity that lifts it way above the average."
France,88,22,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château la Croix Melin 2008  Saint-Émilion,"Soft and full in the mouth, with spice adding an extra dimension to the broad berry fruits. The wine is ready to drink, its acidity melding well into the richness. The final taste is solid and dense."
France,95,214,Chardonnay,white,Olivier Leflaive 2014  Corton-Charlemagne,"Properly rich and majestic, this wine also has impressive amounts of crisp acidity to balance its concentration. The wine has layers of peach and apricot along with beautiful acidity and a taut texture that will allow it to age. It is generous and will become opulent and full bodied as it develops. Drink this powerful wine from 2022."
France,85,55,Riesling,white,Jean-Baptiste Adam 2007 Kaefferkopf Vielles Vignes Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Opens with a classic nose of cream, citrus and spice, giving way to cotton candy, cardamon and café latte in the mouth. The crisp, dry finish of roasted nuts is attractive but doesn't really linger."
US,86,36,Syrah,red,Deep Sea 2008 White Hawk Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"The black pepper and cocoa flavors that always mark this fine vineyard show up again in this dry, tannic wine. So do the blackberries and cassis that make it so sweetly fruity. The acidity is awkward, though, and tastes like it was added to balance out a high alcohol wine."
France,85,30,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Chevillon-Chezeaux 2014  Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits,This is a light wine—fruity and with a soft texture. It has citrus and creamed pear flavors that are balanced with acidity. It's a wine to be drunk now while its fruitiness is still at its peak.
US,91,20,Red Blend,red,Terre Rouge 2013 Tête-à-Tête Red (Sierra Foothills),"Meaty, savory aromas, and lush, dense cherry and berry flavors put a lot of personality into this medium-bodied, ripe and luxurious-feeling wine. It's effusive enough to fill the mouth and satisfy the taste buds, but still dry enough for great balance."
France,87,18,Chardonnay,white,Denis Dutron 2010  Mâcon-Fuissé,"Peach and pear flavors give a rich feel to this warm wine. It has vanilla and cream flavors, with a citrus character that cuts through the ripeness on the finish. Ready to drink."
France,87,26,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Château de Rochemorin 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"This is rich in spice, herbal characteristics and tangy acidity. It has a strongly mineral edge along with green fruits and tight lemon zest. Drink from 2017. André Lurton bought de Rochemorin in 1973; the estate has grown vines since the 16th century."
France,85,11,Chardonnay,white,Gabriel Meffre 2015 La Châsse Chardonnay (Vin de France),"This is a soft wine from a major Rhône valley producer. Attractive acidity gives it a crisp, bright feel. Tangy citrus and clean, light fruitiness are all there, balanced and ready to drink. Drink now."
US,86,30,Syrah,red,Taj 2008 Syrah (Los Carneros),"Medium-bodied, spicy and peppery, this offers dark plum and earthy leather, the fruit tasting quite ripe."
US,95,80,Syrah,red,Cayuse 2013 Cailloux Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The aromas are perfumed and expressive, with notes of crushed flowers, brown stems, black olive, sea salt, smoked meat and funk. The flavors are dense and intense, but still with a silky feel. It's a classic example of this producer, with a finish that just won't quit."
US,84,34,White Blend,white,Greyscale 2008 Cuvée Blanc Galleron Road Vineyard White (Rutherford),"Apparently made from Bordeaux varieties, this wine is crisp and overtly sweet. It has simple, jammy flavors of pineapples, lemons and limes."
Italy,93,40,Red Blend,red,Casa al Vento 2012 Foho Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Red berry, pressed violet, tilled soil and a whiff of tobacco lead the nose. Firm and refined, the delicious palate doles out wild cherry, crushed black raspberry, mint, white pepper and menthol. Tightly knit but polished tannins and fresh acidity provide structure."
Italy,89,24,White Blend,white,Gradis'ciutta 2014 Bràtinis White (Collio),"Made with Chardonnay, Ribolla Gialla and Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of beeswax, acacia flower and yellow apple. The bright palate offers peach, pear, nectarine zest and mineral alongside vibrant acidity. It's racy but balanced."
US,89,22,White Blend,white,Clos La Chance 2013 Hadley's Cuvee White (Central Coast),"It's uncommon to find Grenache Noir in a white blend, but it's a tasty experiment nonetheless. Well rounded and evenly presented, the nose of lemon and honeysuckle is prominent but delicate. The slightly oily palate comes alive with vanilla, pear candy, peach and bubblegum, finishing with a brush of acidity."
US,91,65,Pinot Noir,red,Nicholson Ranch 2013 Cactus Hill Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a nice estate offering from the producer, a celebration of baked cherry pie that's soft and velvety while being full-bodied in style. Fruity and oaky in equal measure, it was aged for almost two years in 35% new French oak, and has a distinct touch of toasted oak on the finish."
US,87,50,Pinot Noir,red,Savannah-Chanelle 2006 Tina Marie Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Tasting a bit tight and candied now, this Pinot might just need a little time in the bottle to knit together. It has that jammy, young wine taste of fresh cherries and raspberries, and mouthwatering acidity. Give it until mid-2009."
US,86,22,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Stinson 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Virginia),"Fermented in stainless steel and concrete, this Sauvignon Blanc packs some pungency on the nose, with aromas of green coffee bean, drying grass, peach yogurt and ripe apricot. Medium to full in body, the acids are dynamic enough to charge the flower and mineral flavors. Pair this with pan-seared sea scallops served in a tarragon beurre blanc."
US,89,29,Chardonnay,white,Dusted Valley 2012 Chardonnay (Ancient Lakes),"Aged in 20% new French oak with half of the wine undergoing malolactic fermentation, it's direct and appealing with peach, melon and buttery spices that lead to a warm finish."
US,94,42,Syrah,red,Tensley 2015 Tensley Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"From Joey Tensley's home vineyard near Los Olivos, this bottling shows very dark and tarry aromas at first but then opens up into cassis, blueberry, black pepper and wild herbs, making for a beautiful and cohesive nose. The tannins are a bit firm and could use a little more patience to soften, but the flavors of tangy black plum, leather, game and pepper are ready to rock."
US,92,90,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Serene 2013 Two Barns Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Appealing complexities appear right from the first sniff, with a mix of rhubarb, tomato leaf, berry, cherry and plum. There is a suggestion of tanned leather, and the brambly fruit flavors carry a lemon-rind edge into a tightly framed, lightly toasty finish."
US,85,60,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Trefethen 2011 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Oak Knoll District),"This is a meaty, brawny Cab, unexpected for a cool vintage from a cool pocket of the Napa Valley. In aromas and flavors, it is dominated by smoke and meaty bacon, with a side of coffee."
Italy,87,15,Pinot Grigio,white,Altadonna 2011 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie),"The private wine label of consulting enologist Stefano Chioccioli, Altadonna is a relatively new line. This expression is redolent of lemon, lime, green apple and honeydew."
US,88,22,Chardonnay,white,Conarium 2012 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"From a Lompoc-based producer comes this Sonoma Coast Chardonnay, pungent in rich, ripe pear puree. Softly textured it goes down easy and is a nice, small-production find."
US,83,30,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Matthews Estate 2008 Stillwater Creek Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This has a rather noticeable candy cane scent, leading into a beery, yeasty, flat-feeling wine."
US,87,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Del Rio 2005 Claret Red (Rogue Valley),"This is a true Claret, in that the blend includes 41% Merlot, 36% Cabernet Franc, 14% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 9% Malbec. It is lushly scented with licorice, tobacco, clove, some plastic and dark fruits, especially black cherry. The fruit and indeed the wine itself has been softened to the point of losing its focus; perhaps an effort to subdue the vineyard's notorious tannins. This is forward and pleasant but a bit diffuse."
US,91,25,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Elevation Cellars 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Earth and olive streaks wrap around tight, compact fruit flavors of berry and plum. The aging in French oak—60% new—adds a light touch of spice without dominating. The tannins are clean, crisp and gently powdery."
US,93,18,Pinot Noir,red,Balletto 2015 Estate Grown Estate Bottled Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Stainless-steel fermented, this crisp, thirst-quenching wine is fruity, floral and highly inviting, focused in well-defined flavors of tangerine and lemon. High in acidity without ever pushing too far, it remains complex and textured on the palate, finishing with a memorable tang."
US,92,39,Chardonnay,white,Testarossa 2010 Fogstone Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"A leesy, young wine, with the slightly sour, creamy richness of sur lie aging. A peacock's tail of tropical and citrus fruits and pears is brightened by crisp acidity and sweetened by toasty oak. Rich and complex; drink now and over the next three years."
US,85,9,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,StoneCap 2013 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A straightforward, easy drinker, this wine starts out a bit reductive before opening to show aromas of herbs, tire rubber, woodspice and blue fruit. It's medium bodied in style with a touch of sugar pulling it all together."
US,89,55,Riesling,white,Casa Larga 2009 Fiori Delle Stelle Ice Wine Riesling (Finger Lakes),"A bouquet of white flowers kissed with honey and stonefruit, this ebullient ice wine bounds from the glass with its sunny, sweet pleasures. It's delicately textured, but penetrating with pristine tropical fruit flavors that linger."
Italy,89,65,Red Blend,red,Carpineto 2009 Sillano Red (Toscana),"A blend of 60% Sangiovese and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has aromas of leafy underbrush, bell pepper, dried herb and black currant. The palate is rather austere, offering dried cherry, leather, licorice and powdered sage alongside tightly wound, grainy tannins that grip the finish. Let the tannins unwind for another year or two, then drink up to catch the remaining fruit."
US,91,88,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,RdV 2010 Lost Mountain Red (Virginia),"Subtle yet decadent aromas of wild berry cobbler, dried flower, chocolate and smoked meat comprise the nose of this Bordeaux-style red blend. Medium to full bodied, this bears firm yet finessed tannins and composed acids. Added notes of leather and spice unfold on the lingering finish."
US,87,50,Pinot Noir,red,Chehalem 2015 Stoller Vineyards Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"In comparison with other new releases from the winery, this seems dilute. With its watery raspberry fruit and astringent acidity, it lacks the stuffing to handle the 55% new oak it was aged in, making the barrel flavors apparent. More time in the bottle may help."
US,89,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Stottle 2009 Elerding Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"Cassis and black-cherry flavors are at the core of this pure Cabernet. It's tight and tannic, with accents of earth and ground coffee. It's definitely a wine that should be decanted well ahead of consuming."
US,93,50,Pinot Noir,red,Point & Line 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Just 50 cases exist of this cellar-worthy bottling from a team of restaurant professionals. The nose offers rounded plum pie, clove and inviting vanilla bean, while the palate is framed by chalky tannins that ensure long life, presenting flavors of baked black cherry, peppercorn, graphite, light mulberry and tart pomegranate. Drink 2018–2028."
France,84,24,Chardonnay,white,Pascal Rollet 2014 Domaine de la Chapelle Les Perriers  (Saint-Véran),"This open, fruity wine has a soft side. Apples and pears are prominent along with a touch of spice. Drink now."
US,85,20,Sangiovese,red,Kyra 2010 Pheasant Vineyard Sangiovese (Wahluke Slope),Though only aged in 30% new oak—half French and half Hungarian—the wood is far out front here with notes of vanilla and butterscotch overtaking the cherry. It's light in style with vanilla flavors throughout.
US,88,58,Pinot Noir,red,La Montagne 2012 Kessler-Haak VIneyard Theron Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Raspberry and clove characterize the nose on this single-vineyard bottling. The palate kicks off with vibrant black cherry, slips toward black olive on the midpalate and ends with bright acidity on a decent finish."
US,86,15,Merlot,red,Canoe Ridge 2011 The Expedition Merlot Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills),"A moderately aromatic Merlot with notes of raspberry, ash, and herbs. Completely coats the palate with an unusually chalky, thick feel."
US,85,25,Red Blend,red,Rumpus 2010 Red (Sonoma Coast),"This is one of those wines that doesn't try to be anything except an easy drinker. Made from Zinfandel and Syrah, it's filled with ripe, sunny California flavors of raspberries and cherries, and will pair well with everyday foods like pizza and hamburgers."
US,91,60,Syrah,red,Amor Fati 2014 Murmur Vineyard Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),"Baked blackberries meet with caramel, vanilla, forest floor and a tart plum skin touch on the nose of this bottling by the Paso Robles-based Tooth & Nail team. It's smooth and soft on the sip, with black currant, elderberry, pepper dust, charcoal and rosemary flavors. It's ripe but with a very dry edge."
US,92,60,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,L'Ecole No. 41 2011 Ferguson Vineyard Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot-Cabernet Franc Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Ferguson is L'Ecole's newest estate vineyard, and this Bordeaux-style blend marks its single-vineyard debut. It's 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot and 11% Cabernet Franc, grown at 1,500 feet in almost pure basalt. The minerality is a signature trait, along with raspberry, cassis and wild cherry fruit flavors. This seems sure to improve by 2020–2022."
US,88,25,Riesling,white,j.brix 2013 The Augur Kick On Ranch Vineyard Riesling (Santa Barbara County),"Aromas of Key lime skins and lemon bar cookies hide a slight but typical petrol note on this wine from the San Diego County-based producer. It's slightly sour on the citrusy palate, with balanced acidity and a chalky grip."
US,91,19,Pinot Gris,white,Elk Cove 2007 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"This is a fruit-powered wine, loaded with fresh pear, melon and tropical flavors. It shows no sign of having suffered from the wet, cool weather that hit Oregon during the 2007 harvest. It seems riper than the perfectly balanced '06 bottling, with lower acids and a streak of vanilla and coconut wrapping up the finish."
France,86,30,Chardonnay,white,Louis Latour 2010  Chablis,"Light and fruity, this has a yeasty edge along with acidity. On the palate, there are lots of green fruits, offering a dancing, lively character. At the end, there is a touch of vanilla."
US,87,12,Riesling,white,Mirassou 2008 Riesling (California),"Off-dry, this is very nearly a dessert wine, but it's crisp and minerally enough to consider as a dry table wine. Shows tart, clean flavors of citrus, peach, apricot and wildflower, with the diesel taste of Riesling."
US,85,21,Syrah,red,Pheasant Valley Winery 2007 Chukar Ridge Syrah (Columbia Valley (OR)),"This is already drying out, its fruit fading and its mouthfeel turning a bit woody. There's a trace of of tart berry fruit, with plenty of drying tannins. Drink now."
US,83,20,Chardonnay,white,Cambridge California 2013 Cold Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),"Thick and sour, this wine has a waxy fruit component to it that is off-putting and out of sync with the crisp fruit that is trying to compete on the palate."
US,88,16,Red Blend,red,Victor Vineyards 2011 Roadside Red Red (California),"A blend of undisclosed varieties from the Central Valley, and a great bargain. You'll be pleasantly surprised by the lush red fruit, spice, mocha and anise flavors, and how easy this wine is to like."
US,93,42,Pinot Noir,red,Fort Ross 2012 Fort Ross Vineyard Sea Slopes Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Pleasantly pungent in ripe damson plum, this Pinot has lovely acidity, giving it a spicy mouthfeel around firmly present tannins. Full-bodied midpalate, the wine mellows through to the finish, ending in juicy fruit and earth."
US,84,42,Pinot Noir,red,August Truth 2012 Manchester Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge),"A dark color and candied, pruney aromas give way to jammy black cherry flavors and a lightly tannic texture. This is tart and medium bodied, with straightforward ripe flavors."
Italy,91,16,Red Blend,red,Poggio Argentiera 2011 Bellamarsilia  (Morellino di Scansano),"Blue flower, red berries and Mediterranean herbs take center stage in this delicious blend of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Ciliegiolo. The bright, lively palate offers a solid core of black cherry and raspberry layered with black pepper and thyme. It's extremely inviting and approachable now, so enjoy soon. Vos Selections, Tosco Wine."
US,86,12,Red Blend,red,Fetzer NV Anthony's Hill Dark Bold Red (California),"Not quite as bold as its name suggests, this wine is well-balanced and fun to sip. Fruity and medium-bodied, it smells like raspberries and rhubarb, tastes like red cherries and feels nicely full on the palate, bolstered by a hearty dose of fine tannins."
US,90,36,Sangiovese,red,Stolpman 2009 Estate Sangiovese (Santa Ynez Valley),"Stolpman grows its Sangiovese in an area of the Santa Ynez Valley where most producers specialize in Rhône varieties. The result is often one of the most interesting California interpretations of the great Tuscan grape. Give this a long decanting because right out the bottle it's acidic and closed, but then the rich, spicy cherry flavor surfaces."
US,87,35,Zinfandel,red,Kuleto Estate 2008 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"A good, rich, flashy Zinfandel. There's not much to get excited about, but it delivers Zin's personality in a most attractive way. It's spicy, rich and sweet in cherry, raspberry, cocoa, honey and spice flavors."
US,89,100,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Flora Springs 2008 Rennie Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"A really rich Cabernet, jam-packed with blackberry, cherry, raspberry and mocha flavors that are slightly sweet, with a brown sugar taste. The sweetness comes from the caramelized oak, not residual sugar, but the wine does have a candied quality. A bit rustic now. Give it 5–6 years and try again."
US,85,26,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Flora Springs 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Reduced, with a pronounced aroma of oak, this is a simple, moderately focused wine that presents as fleshy and thick, bursting in flavors of grass."
US,91,52,Pinot Noir,red,Williams Selyem 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This shows the lovely balance of both the winery and the appellation, with a silky, lightly tannic mouthfeel brightened by plenty of acidity. The flavors are delicate and complex, suggesting wild raspberries, thyme, cranberries and toast. No reason to age this puppy, so drink now–2016."
Italy,89,22,Red Blend,red,San Fabiano Calcinaia 2012  Chianti Classico,"Aromas of ripe plum, violet, vanilla, toast and leafy underbrush come together on this is full-bodied red. The palate offers black cherry marinated in spirits, grilled porcini mushroom and dried aromatic herb alongside assertive tannins that leave a somewhat drying finish."
US,87,24,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Vigilance 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County),"Toasty, smoky oak aromas and flavors dominate this medium-bodied wine that is soft around the edges. With little noticeable tannin and low acidity it comes off as slightly sweet."
US,91,70,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Trinchero 2012 Haystack Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),"This is an easy-drinking, roundly accessible vineyard designate, with a depth and breadth of black fruit, cedar, currant and cocoa powder. A juicy midpalate gives way to an integrated finish, unburdened by tannin and oak, despite the mountain provenance and full-bodied power of the wine."
Italy,87,75,Sangiovese,red,Citille di Sopra 2010 Vigna Poggio Ronconi  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Earthy aromas include new leather, scorched soil, wild berry and a touch of funky game. On the robust palate, grilled sage, tobacco and licorice add depth to a core of fleshy wild cherry along a backbone of raspy tannins and searing alcohol. Drink after 2018."
US,91,40,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,L'Ecole No. 41 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"All varietal, this blend of fruit from seven vineyards across the valley shows nuances of cocoa, earth, coffee, herbs and cherry. There's a lot of generosity and midpalate depth to the flavors along with a sense of balance that carries through the finish."
US,92,50,Pinot Noir,red,Erath 2006 Bishop Creek Pinot Noir,"The first Bishop Creek designation from Erath, this dark-toned, deep and concentrated Pinot Noir is one to cellar. The fruit is seamless, sappy and dense, suggesting a mix of ripe berries. Fourteen months in French oak, about 40% new, seems just right, as the barrel notes of toast and coffee dance around the juicy berry flavors without smothering them."
US,86,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Borjón 2012 Valle de Napa Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A layering of 100% new French oak takes center stage in this wine, which is leathery and rustic. Black currant and tight-grain tannin compete for attention atop a noticeable seasoning of dried herb."
France,94,70,Chardonnay,white,Domaine Jean-Paul et Benoît Droin 2010 Grenouilles Grand Cru  (Chablis),"Firm and closed, this shows both richness and minerality. It has hidden power, concentration and a steely edge. It's crisp and densely packed with minerality and ripeness. For aging over at least seven years."
US,86,18,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Whitehall Lane 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This is a softly gentle wine, with a drop of Sémillon contributing an oily, cashew earthiness to Sauvignon's citrus and tropical fruit flavors."
France,91,17,Pinot Gris,white,André Kientzler 2015 Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Notes of ripe Russet pear dominate nose and palate. The fresh body gives full rein to these ample lively fruit flavors. Zesty tangy freshness counters the full fruit and creates a lively, harmonious, moreish and refreshing wine. The finish is dry."
France,90,85,Chardonnay,white,J. Dumangin Fils NV Premier Cru Blanc de Blancs Premium Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"Pure, beautifully delicate wine, with mineral striations that line out the grapefruit and citrus flavors. It is certainly very crisp, with a light touch of toast just showing, finishing with a delicious burst of acidity."
US,88,13,Pinot Gris,white,Cline 2016 Estate Grown Pinot Gris (Sonoma Coast),"A stainless-steel wine that's attractively priced and easy to like, this is bright, juicy and stony, highlighted in peach and nutmeg. The crisp acidity provides tension and body."
US,86,29,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,James Charles 2014 Arrivato 1913 Ameritage Red (Virginia),"A mild concentration of cherry, green herb, spice and rose petals mark the nose. Softly grained tannins offer just enough grip to this medium-bodied wine, with high-toned cherry and cranberry leading the flavors."
US,89,55,Zinfandel,red,Bella 2010 Barrel 32 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Nothing subtle about this Zin, which offers a heady blast of grilled raspberries and cherries. It's a robust wine, with lots of alcohol and spices and a rich finish. This is your go-to summer barbecue wine."
US,94,95,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Antica 2008 Townsend Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Doesn't say so on the label, but this is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, from the Atlas Peak area. Very dry and tannic, with an astringent lockdown, it's functionally undrinkable now, but it does show the intensity of this mountainous region for Cabernet, with explosive blackberry, blueberry and black currant flavors. All indications are that it's an ager. Hold until 2015, at the very least."
US,88,22,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Brander 2015 La Presa Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc,"Fresh key lime aromas meet sweeter tangerine and floral scents on the nose of this single vineyard bottling. The acidity is punchy on the palate, with tangy green fruit flavors that recall Anjou pear and lime skins."
US,83,35,Sangiovese,red,Ticket Cellars 2008 Standing Ovation Sangiovese (Santa Barbara County),"A soft, simple wine, with candied cherry and raspberry flavors. It has a sweet finish. Drink now."
US,93,44,Pinot Noir,red,Arista 2013 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This delicious, compelling, full-bodied wine blends luscious fruit flavors like red cherry and boysenberry with stylish, spicy oak accents and a firm backing of acidity and tannins to keep the mouthfeel vital. The fruit and softly spicy nuances mingle beautifully and seem to melt in the mouth. It's great to drink through 2020."
US,92,55,Pinot Noir,red,Davis Bynum 2012 Jane's Vineyard Clone 667 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a robust, brawny wine, exuberant in wild strawberry and earthy black pepper and black tea. Leathery layers of mushroom and toasted oak combine for a full-bodied experience that speaks well of the appellation. A concentrated version of one clone of the grape from a single vineyard in a stellar vintage."
US,91,21,Red Blend,red,MCV 2013 Red (Paso Robles),"Vintner Matt Villard blends Petite Sirah, Syrah, Grenache, Tannat and Petit Verdot into this whopper of a wine, which is very fairly priced. Aromas of vanilla-laden black cherries, hot fudge and licorice lace into an elegant, well-integrated nose. Once sipped, flavors of smoked blackberries, black rocks, purple flowers and more licorice linger long on the palate."
Italy,88,40,Sangiovese,red,Terre Nere Campigli Vallone 2011  Brunello di Montalcino,"Forest floor, grilled porcini, charred earth and a whiff of leather lead the nose. The ripe palate offers dried black cherry, raspberry, clove, licorice and tobacco alongside chewy tannins. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the close."
US,89,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Stottle 2012 Big Eddie Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Merlot (55%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (40%) make up the majority of this wine with the balance Malbec. Vanilla, barrel spice and dark-fruit aromas are followed by saturated black-fruit flavors that linger. The oak gets a bit out-front but the wine still has much to offer."
US,81,32,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,La Chiripada 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (New Mexico),"A spicy, candied fruitcake nose leads into slightly tart cherry flavors in this New Mexico Cab. The structure is good but the wine needs a bit more balance and depth. Still, it has potential."
France,88,25,Chardonnay,white,Fourrey et Fils 2010  Chablis,"Bright and fruity, this has refreshing acidity. It has a lively apple flavor that gives a delicate fragrance and juiciness. With its taut, mineral texture, this is classic, unoaked Chablis."
US,88,30,Pinot Noir,red,Fritz 2010 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The texture is a bit rough for a Pinot Noir, lacking the silkiness you expect. Instead, you get the briary, brambly mouthfeel of a Zinfandel. But the wine is very flavorful in cherries and red currants. Give it a decant and drink up with grilled beef or lamb."
US,84,8,Chardonnay,white,Paul Thomas 1999 Chardonnay (Washington),"Bone-dry, hard and crisp, this is a basic, stainless-steel fermented, nonmalolactic style of Chardonnay. Brisk and competent, but neutral."
US,91,22,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Andrew Rich 2015 Croft Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Willamette Valley),"This new vintage is as pleasing as those in the past, with spicy flavors touching on pink grapefruit, orange rind and flesh, and just a hint of sweetness rounding off the bright acids. It's well-balanced and in a prime drinking window."
US,92,53,Pinot Noir,red,Square Peg 2014 SP-SL Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine made from estate-grown, dry-farmed fruit has a large presence on the nose, offering earthy rose and lavender aromas. Velvety on the palate, it broods in tart cherry and rhubarb flavors, with allspice and toasted oak notes that accentuate its spice on the long finish."
US,92,49,Pinot Noir,red,Trisaetum 2015 Coast Range Estate Pinot Noir,"This cool site, set on sedimentary and volcanic soils, brings a blend of five clones into focus. Dark and juicy, muscular and complex, it weaves together plum and cherry fruit, a whiff of truffle, and finishes with a touch of coffee from the barrel aging."
US,93,64,Pinot Noir,red,Testarossa 2014 Tondre Grapefield Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Cooked cranberry scents are enlivened by turned earth, dewy sage and a touch of wildfire smoke in this bottling from the Los Gatos-based winery. Baked red-cherry flavors meet with a savory pork-au-jus-like element on the palate, redolent with roasted thyme and oregano. A licorice element rises toward the finish. It's mellow in intensity but with lots of depth."
France,88,33,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Sauvion 2016 Loire Valley  (Sancerre),"Green-fruit aromas and intense, tangy fruit define this wine. It is strongly herbal, bringing out a zesty character that is right up front. It is probably a few months away from being ready to drink, so wait until summer 2018."
Italy,89,52,Red Blend,red,Rocca delle Macìe 2011 Ser Gioveto Red (Toscana),"Made from Sangiovese blended with 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this opens with aromas of sawdust, oak, exotic spice and a whiff of black currant. The palate displays toasted oak, roasted coffee beans, menthol, ground black pepper and dried black cherries alongside grippy tannins that leave an astringent finish."
France,93,224,Pinot Noir,red,Domaine Dujac 2009 Les Combottes  (Gevrey-Chambertin),"All the proper structure of young Gevrey-Chambertin with the addition of rich, generous fruit. The core is of wood and dry fruit tannins, the fruit of rich black plum juice. At this stage, the wine is firm. Give it 5–6 years to open up."
US,82,14,Chardonnay,white,Airlie 2009 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This barrel-fermented Chardonnay cloaks its thin fruit in aggressive flavors of wood and butter. The wine itself is soft and watery, quickly disappearing into a frail finish."
US,87,24,Red Blend,red,Sineann 2005 Blend Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This red wine named simply Blend is – guess what! – a mix of Columbia valley grapes, including Syrah, Petite Sirah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Zinfandel and Grenache. This is bigger and spicier than Sineann's other blend, called simple Red Table Wine, and shows more concentration. The acids and tannins are in a stand-off at the moment, but throw a steak into the mix and you'll have a party."
France,85,17,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château Rousset-Caillau 2010  Bordeaux Supérieur,"While there is probably plenty of ripe fruit somewhere in this wine, it is all too much dominated by high toast wood flavors which will likely always give a tough character. It only just hints at a more generous side."
US,93,58,Zinfandel,red,Robert Biale 2014 Valsecchi Vineyard Zinfandel (Carneros),"Meaty and dusty, this wine from a Vineburg-based site is full bodied, ripe and voluptuous with a light dusting of black pepper and clove. Within its cradling of dense concentration, an underbelly of acidity allows for freshness within the power."
US,87,32,Pinot Noir,red,Siltstone 2011 Guadalupe Vineyard Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This single-vineyard designate is labeled simply Oregon, but is actually Dundee Hills. Somewhat dilute fruit flavors suggest pomegranate and tart strawberries. Despite 18 months in half new French oak, the wood does not overwhelm the fruit, and the wine actually improves overnight. Give it a good decanting for optimum drinking."
US,93,59,Zinfandel,red,Michael David 2012 Rage Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Bold and beautiful, this powerful Zin has a deep, dark color that's practically black but with a brilliant ruby rim. Brooding aromas suggest wood smoke, black pepper and boysenberry. There is an impressive density in texture, as firm tannins and acidity support the rich array of flavors."
US,94,60,Syrah,red,Whetstone 2011 Phoenix Ranch Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),"Vibrantly intoxicating wafts of varietal pepper and violets are complemented by gorgeous layers of blackberry, raspberry and smoky, gamy meat. The acidity marks the palate most, however, lifting the wine's denseness of concentration into a more complex and interesting place. Made in small quantities, this wine is ready to enjoy but will age through 2021, as well."
US,87,14,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Roza Ridge 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rattlesnake Hills),"This is a sophisticated Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated, Bordeaux-style blend, with 9% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot and 5% Malbec. It carries a note of leather and drying tannins, suggesting that you should drink it fairly soon. It should be delicious with a grilled steak."
US,99,75,Pinot Noir,red,Williams Selyem 2010 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This expresses the greatness of its vintage and vineyard, offering wave after wave of raspberry and cherry pie flavors, plus notes of red currant, sweet licorice, spicy Dr. Pepper and smoky sandalwood. There's also something exotically briary and wild that intrigues. Even more remarkable is the texture, an amalgam of acids and tannins that rivals any Pinot Noir ever produced in California. It should age for up to 20 years."
France,88,17,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Bel Air Perponcher 2006  Bordeaux Blanc,"A freshly herbaceous wine, a reminder of how crisp, grassy and refreshing white Bordeaux can be. This has a lively green and white fruit character, all vibrant acidity. Drink now."
US,93,145,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Beaulieu Vineyard 2012 Clone 4 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Aiming to highlight one Cab clone grown in the dusty soils of the appellation, this well-crafted wine remains tight in grippy tannins for the meantime. Just enough compelling notes of cedar, grenadine, red cherry and truffle hit the palate to suggest further aging. Drink from 2017–2027."
Italy,86,65,Sangiovese,red,La Fornace 2012 Origini  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Coconut, oak, vanilla and leather aromas lead the nose and carry over to the bracing palate. The wine lacks fruit richness, suggesting instead dried notes of cherry skin and sage. Tight, raspy tannins leave an astringent finish."
US,86,15,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Magnolia Court 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Dried blueberries and chopped oregano show on the nose of this widely distributed brand. The palate is powered by sagebrush and other wild herbs, with plum and olallieberry fruit."
US,85,8,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Oak Grove 2013 Family Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (California),"This is fresh and citrusy, with lemon and grapefruit aromas that lead to lightly herbal flavors. It tastes almost dry, is medium bodied, and has a good balance of crispness and straightforward fruit character."
US,91,50,Pinot Noir,red,Mark Ryan 2009 Black Love Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The fruit is sourced from Mark Ryan-designated rows in the Lachini Vineyard. Fermented with native yeast in stainless steel, and aged in 50% new French oak, this opens with plenty of green tea-flavored tannins, and an undercurrent of earth and wood, but the Pinot fruit shines through and expands, with notes of cola, cherry fruit and a streak of iron."
US,92,52,Pinot Noir,red,Stephen Ross 2012 Stone Corral Vineyard Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Blackberry, licorice, black pepper, uncrushed cloves and pencil shavings emerge from this wine by veteran Steve Dooley. It's richly layered on the palate, with dried strawberry, fennel, black earth, oregano and chopped dried sage, providing a flavorful offering from his home vineyard."
US,81,14,Chardonnay,white,Michael Pozzan 2007 Special Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Oaky and direct in ripe tropical fruit, with a gooseberry taste more akin to Sauvignon Blanc, this Chard is unripe and simple."
US,88,49,Syrah,red,Fess Parker 2013 Rodney's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Smoky notes of roasted meat and white pepper spice up the plum skins and blackberry fruit that show on the nose of this bottling. The smoke is also prominent on the sip, where graphite minerality frames the blueberry and blackberry fruit. The character of slightly burnt balsamic reduction sauce also shows through."
US,86,22,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Kunde 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"More useful than rich, this Cab is dry and full-bodied, with blackberry, black currant, herb and smoky oak flavors. Drink now."
US,88,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Longboard 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Tropical in personality, this wine is also singing in acidity, offering refreshing stone-like minerality to complement the fruit. Layered and just the slightest bit grassy, it's a wonderfully refreshing quaff, and a fantastic choice with seafood."
France,90,15,Bordeaux-style White Blend,white,Château Lestruelle 2016  Bordeaux Blanc,"Still very young, this is a Maison Bouey wine with good potential. It offers hints of the ripe yellow fruits and richness that will come as it develops. The touch of perfumed spice means it is also a wine to savor as an apéritif."
US,83,20,Red Blend,red,Graveyard NV Paso Tombstone Red (Paso Robles),"Dense olallieberry and asphalt show on the nose of this bottling, as does a tart black-plum-skin scent. There is grape-like sweetness to the palate, and touches of cola, but not much else."
US,90,65,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Corley 2007 Yewell Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"Right now this is a big, tough Cabernet. It's very dry and oaky, and the black and red cherry flavors have a jammy edge. Despite the apparent simplicity, you find yourself returning to it, a good sign that suggests complex ageability. Give it 4–6 years in a cool cellar."
Italy,87,34,Red Blend,red,Massi di Mandorlaia 2013 Mandorlaia Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano),"Aromas recalling Mediterranean brush, fresh violet, moist soil and a toasted note lead the way. The straightforward palate offers juicy wild cherry, dried sage, espresso and a hint of anise alongside lithe tannins. Enjoy soon."
US,89,85,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Ballentine 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This wine is brooding in black and red currant, with dusty, well-integrated tannins and a curl of smoke. Big bodied, it finishes in a puckering way, hefty on the palate."
US,91,165,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Beaulieu Vineyard 2013 Reserve Clone 4 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Dense, with a substantial amount of tannin and oak upfront, this clone designate, 100% varietal, is chalky in texture and showy in oak. Red currant, cedar and an unfurling of tobacco leaf provide fruit and savory herbaceousness."
US,87,22,White Blend,white,Murrieta's Well 2013 The Whip White (Livermore Valley),"Fresh apple aromas and lively citrus flavors make a good combination in this light-bodied, tangy-textured wine. It tastes slightly rounded with sweetness, but comes off clean, crisp and appetizing. The two main components are Sémillon and Chardonnay, with dashes of Sauvignon Blanc and Orange Muscat."
US,83,15,Riesling,white,Lake Chelan 2009 Sweet Riesling (Lake Chelan),"Though labeled sweet, this has just enough acidity to feel off-dry in the mouth. It brings a mix of pear and peach, apple and orange peel flavors, which fade rather quickly into a flat finish."
US,82,14,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cupcake 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),"Tastes like a cherry-berry fruit drink with lots of acidity, giving it a sweet-sour flavor. At least the alcohol is low."
US,88,60,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Matthews 2013 Reserve Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"In this blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc, vanilla, carob, herb, green wood and dark fruit aromas are followed by fruit and oak-derived flavors in equal proportion. It shows restraint but doesn't come together."
France,90,65,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Château de l'Annonciation 2011  Saint-Émilion,"This is a firm wine with ripe Merlot fruits that are still sheathed in tannins. Densely textured, it is rich with berries and a stalky character that needs to soften. Wait for this solid, concentrated and ageworthy wine until 2017."
US,92,45,Pinot Noir,red,Aubichon Cellars 2011 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The reserve is a barrel selection and demonstrates its special status with pretty floral topnotes suggesting rose petals and body soap. In the mouth it's a substantial wine with juicy red fruits, excellent texture and impressive length. A lick of milk chocolate puts the frosting on the finish."
US,86,19,Chardonnay,white,Bellacana 2013 Bellacana Vineyard Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),"Coconut-laden oak kicks off the entry of this wine, a crisp version of the variety that nonetheless exhibits plenty of oak characteristics and a rich ripeness of baked apple, pear and pineapple."
US,93,48,Zinfandel,red,Scott Harvey 2014 Vineyard 1869 Zinfandel (Amador County),"This is a great example of a dry well-balanced Zin to drink with dinner rather than as a sweet dessert. It's also a taste of history, coming from a vineyard originally planted in 1869. It's medium bodied, nicely structured with firm tannins and has aromatic complexity from cedar, tobacco and cardamom notes, plus delicious just-ripe cherry flavors."
US,92,75,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Von Strasser 2005 Rainin Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"Very hard in tannins, with a real lockdown astringency in the mouth, this is one for the cellar, and it's a slam dunk that age will reward it. Drily balanced and elegantly constructed, it brims with rich blackberry and black currant flavors, with a fine coating of spicy oak. Best 2012–2018."
US,91,35,Riesling,white,Prager 2006 Sweet Claire Late Harvest Riesling (California),"This is a rich, very sweet dessert wine that tastes like some botrytis hit the grapes. It has intense flavors of apricot jam, pineapple-infused crème brûlée and butter-vanilla cookie flavors that are decadently delicious."
Italy,92,65,Sangiovese,red,Villa I Cipressi 2011  Brunello di Montalcino,"Aromas of scorched earth, truffle, woodland berry, sage and a whiff of cured meat unfold on this firm red while ripe black cherry, raspberry jam, licorice, grilled herb and clove wrap around the palate. Tightly wound tannins support the savory flavors."
US,91,55,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,red,Pacific Ridge 2004 Grace Red (Napa Valley),"This is a Merlot-Cabernet blend from St. Helena and Oakville. It's pretty good, dry and rich in black currants, cherries and oak. The tannins are stronger than on your average gooey cult Cab, with a peppery astringency suggesting modest aging. Try after 2008."
US,86,30,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Burgess 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Simple, easy and balanced, this crowd-pleasing Cab will satisfy for its wealth of ripe fruit and oak flavors. Floods the mouth with cassis, licorice and melted milk chocolate, wrapped in smooth, gentle tannins."
France,90,57,Chardonnay,white,Château de Fuissé 2008 Le Clos  (Pouilly-Fuissé),Well structured wine with plenty of ripe fruit. The freshness of fruit is replaced by spice and peach flavors.
US,82,33,Syrah,red,Fallbrook 2009 33 Degrees North Gracie Hill Vineyard Syrah (South Coast),This estate-grown 100% Syrah is sour and inelegant on its own but would have worked nicely in a blend where it could have provided meaty structure.
US,86,38,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Ross Andrew 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A firm, youthful Cabernet, with cassis and blue plum fruit accented by dried herb, graphite and asphalt. As it sat in the glass, a distinct leathery aroma emerged and the fruit quickly faded."
US,88,70,Pinot Noir,red,Tantara 2012 Pommard Clone Dierberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Winemaker Jeff Fink is unleashing a cross-section of clones in 2012, and this take on Pommard offers delicious aromas of berry-laced crème brûlée with bay leaf. There is a bitterness at first on the tannic palate, and it washes out quickly with tart cranberries."
US,88,38,Pinot Noir,red,Hawley 2011 Oehlman Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Hawley has been making this single-vineyard Pinot for years, and the wine has achieved real consistency. The 2011, like the 2010, is bright in acidity, with ripe raspberry, cranberry and sandalwood flavors. It's a fine Pinot to drink now."
US,85,8,Merlot,red,Round Hill 2008 Merlot (California),"Lots to admire in this dry, full-bodied Merlot. It's forward and charming in sour red cherry candy, blueberry and herb flavors, with a nice edge of smoky oak. Contains a little Cabernet and Zinfandel for complexity, and the alcohol is nice and low. Great price."
France,90,19,Riesling,white,Domaine Zinck 2014 Terroir Riesling (Alsace),"Riper suspicions of yellow plum insinuate themselves on the nose. The palate is shot through with lemony freshness that brightens everything. Taut and fresh, this also has Alsace's more rounded edges. With time, more aromas arise, finishing in a fruity mix of apple, stone fruit and citrus."
Italy,88,30,Red Blend,red,Colle Spinello 2010 Tre Quarti Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano),"This opens with aromas that recall mature plum, resin and nail polish. The palate offers fleshy blackberry, nutmeg, anise and vanilla alongside fine-grained tannins. A subtle warmth of alcohol marks the close."
US,83,4,Chardonnay,white,Pam's Cuties NV Unoaked Chardonnay (California),"Sweet and fruity, this canned wine feels soft and syrupy, with sugary pear as the primary flavor on the palate. It's a basic white wine in a convenient package."
US,90,35,Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Finn Hill 2012 Le Beau Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"All varietal coming from Hedges Estate Vineyard, this all-new French-oak-aged wine opens with aromas of toast, spicebox, espresso and cherry. The palate is tightly wound with dark fruit flavors and abundant oak accents throughout that linger on the finish. The wood (all new French) needs time to integrate but there is much to enjoy."
US,90,25,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Twomey 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa County-Sonoma County),"With the majority of the fruit from the producer's Calistoga and Oakville estate vineyards, as well as its Healdsburg property, this is a dry, citrus-laden wine, zesty and refreshing in lime and grapefruit. The acidity is dialed high, yet remains balanced by the density of fruit and body, the overall effect just right in terms of ripeness."
US,89,20,Sauvignon Blanc,white,Hosmer 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Cayuga Lake),"Pretty white-flower, lemon and lime notes waft from the glass of this dry light-bodied Sauvignon Blanc. It's vibrantly fruity, full of fresh pineapple and nectarine flavors accented by a swathe of green herb and bramble. The finish is refreshing, crisp and mineral. Drink now through 2019."
France,89,18,Riesling,white,Allimant-Laugner 2015 Riesling (Alsace),"Generous orange and ripe, red apple meet with the zesty freshness of tangerine peel in this wine. It's dry but fresh, with bouncy, joyful fruitfulness. The super-clean finish is lip-smacking."
France,86,23,Pinot Noir,red,Ruhlmann NV Harmonie Rosé Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace),"In this soft, ripe wine, red fruits are balanced by acidity, while the gentle texture marries well with the light mousse. It's immediately attractive with its fresh aftertaste."
Italy,86,15,Pinot Grigio,white,Fiegl 2014 Pinot Grigio (Collio),"Pressed flower, pear and crushed rock aromas lead the nose. The lively palate offers lime, green apple skin and mineral alongside racy acidity."
US,86,15,Merlot,red,Diversion 2014 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas of tire rubber, plum and red currant are followed by sweet plump fruit flavors. Chalky tannins provide the frame."
Italy,89,13,White Blend,white,Pico Maccario 2010 Estrosa White (Monferrato),"This is a gorgeous Italian white from northern Italy that boasts fragrant tones of spring flower and chopped herb backed by peach, honey and white almond. It's crisp, intense and would be perfect with basil Thai curry."
